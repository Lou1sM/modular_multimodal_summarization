        "Man: I do wish you'd allow me to repack these properly. My cousin is going to be very cross.",
        "Nora: I have a little tin of shortbreads with Nigel's name on them.",
        "Man: Oh, he'll like that. And Master Matthew, is he aware that you're decamping?",
        "Bo: We'll stop at Warwick on the way to Gatwick -- wick, wick.",
        "Nora: Yeah. We just -- we'll be back as soon as we -- we just have some things we have to take care of in the states, so it's fine.",
        "David: So, time to face the country-western music?",
        "Man: I'll just call the driver.",
        "David: You going to tell Clint that you're in love?",
        "Nora: S --",
        "David: I will take that as a yes, and good on ya, but I'll give you a piece of advice. Suit up. I'm talking full body armor, because Clint -- he likes to aim directly at the chest, so you got to keep moving, serpentine. It's your only chance, because I'll tell you something -- Uncle Clint, he may be a fine shot, but his eyes, they ain't what they used to be.",
        "Clint: Well, if you want to test that theory, Vickers, I can draw a bead on you right now.",

        "T\u00e9a: What the hell is taking so long? If it's impossible for Daniella to leave the grounds, which I don't believe for a minute, why can't they find her?",
        "Eli: If your daughter is anything like you, I'm sure she's one step ahead of them.",
        "T\u00e9a: Where's Daniella?",
        "Headmistress: Why don't we sit down?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why don't you spare us the pleasantries and admit you lost her?",
        "Eli: T\u00e9a...",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Eli: I think the headmistress has some news for us.",
        "Headmistress: The security team has finished its search of the grounds. There's no sign of your daughter.",
        "Eli: Okay, okay, so she's hiding someplace, so you can't pull her out of here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, for God's sake, Eli, she's not hiding anywhere. Your brother kidnapped her.",

        "Matthew: Thanks to you.",
        "Dani: And Tom.",
        "Matthew: And Destiny. Hey, look, when we get to Seattle, I'm probably just gonna check right into the hospital. You should probably try your dad again and then get yourself into a hotel. Don't worry, you'll find him.",
        "Dani: And then you'll run back to your soul mate.",
        "Matthew: My soul mate?",
        "Dani: Destiny. That's what she is, isn't she?",

        "Kyle: Yeah. We can reschedule if you --",
        "Oliver: No, no. I mean, unless you have other plans.",
        "Kyle: No, no. Only plans I had were to hang out with you, but I think those can wait until you take a shower.",
        "Oliver: Uh, right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to get here as fast -- you know, I'm just gonna jump in the shower.",

        "Mitch: Yes, daughter?",
        "Jessica: But you're dead.",
        "Mitch: Well, as the man said, the rumors of my death were greatly exaggerated. Come to papa.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I don't understand. What won't you do?",
        "Layla: Just let me try and say this, okay? There are a million reasons why I should just walk away from you -- Evangeline, and I know you were broken up before the accident, but she loved you, and she's my sister. And Sarah. Well, no. She definitely got shafted by you. Don't argue with me, because she did. And she's a really good friend. And me? Well, I should just hang it up. I mean, look at my track record with men -- it's ridiculous. I'm doing better on my own, if you want to know the truth, than when I'm with somebody or trying to be with somebody. I have my own apartment and a good job and --",
        "Cristian: So, what's the problem, then?",
        "Layla: You. You make me feel good, alive, you know, and I don't want to give that up. I mean, look at Oliver and Kyle. They almost walked away from something really good because they were scared, and I don't want to do that. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Hey, Prince Charming, stop combing your hair and let's get out of here.",
        "Oliver: Sorry. I just -- I'm gonna be ready in a second. I need my shirt. My shirt?",
        "Kyle: Oh, sorry. Uh, we don't have to go out.",
        "Oliver: Oh, what do you mean?",
        "Kyle: We could just stay in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Of course guys have soul mates. Everybody has somebody out there they're supposed to be with.",
        "Matthew: I guess.",
        "Dani: I mean, look at your parents. From everything you've told me, they're made for each other.",
        "Matthew: And the fact that they're divorced and my mom just married my uncle?",
        "Dani: Details. Anyway, parents are lame. My mother is so not right for my dad, or for me. She's such a pain. God, you're loud when you're quiet.",
        "Matthew: I'm just thinking about what comes next.",
        "Dani: What do you mean?",
        "Matthew: When they find out that we're gone.",

        "T\u00e9a: I trusted you to keep my ex-husband away from my daughter.",
        "Eli: T\u00e9a, I'm sure that security is dealing --",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't you handle me! Your brother kidnapped my daughter.",
        "Eli: There is no evidence that Ross came back here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Then where is she? Tell me where she is! Give me one plausible explanation!",
        "Security Man: Excuse me, headmistress. My review of the security tapes has revealed a person of interest.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ross. It's got to be Ross.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What are you doing here? Did they find Jared?",
        "Clint: Not yet, but if they need me, they can reach me. I thought I'd jet over and see my beautiful wife.",
        "Nora: Oh. Well, that's -- that's wonderful.",
        "David: Isn't it great? The Buchanan men together at the old compound, huh?",
        "Clint: What are you doing here, Vickers?",
        "David: Getting in the way. I'll leave you alone to talk.",
        "Clint: All right. Who's gonna pour me a \"Welcome to London\" drink? What's with the luggage here? Are you going somewhere?",
        "Nora: Well, I mean, I -- we were.",
        "Bo: We were going home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So, this Mitch Laurence was the cult leader I was talking about, a real menace. You never heard his name before?",
        "Brody: No.",
        "John: Jessica never mentioned him?",
        "Brody: Why would she?",
        "John: He's her father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: No hug for dear old dad, not even one?",
        "Natalie: You're a sick bastard.",
        "Mitch: Darling, please. Is that any way to speak to your husband?",
        "Natalie: You're not my husband.",
        "Jared: Oh, my God, is this your crazy ex? Is this Mitch?",
        "Mitch: Crazy? Natalie, I'm hurt.",
        "Jared: I thought you said he was dead.",
        "Natalie: I thought he was dead.",
        "Jessica: He was. I killed him.",
        "Mitch: Not very Christian of you, daughter. You and Natalie are clearly in need of enlightenment, but worry not. We will recommit ourselves to the way of truth together as a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: It's a lie. It has to be. Mitch died years ago. Roxy got the stem cells from my father last winter.",
        "Corrine: Honey, you can't believe a word that comes out of that woman's mouth.",
        "Rex: It was a perfect match.",
        "Corrine: That is true, but that doesn't mean it came from your father.",
        "Rex: Okay, why would she lie? Okay, she's a liar -- we know that, but so are you.",
        "Corrine: I apologized for dragging you here and drugging you, but I was scared to death. Do you think I want any of this to be true? I wouldn't wish Mitch Laurence on my worst enemy. All I know is what's in that envelope -- the proof.",
        "Rex: That my father is a psychopath?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You lost any right to us.",
        "Mitch: \"You let your women keep silent in churches, for it is not permitted unto them to speak. Let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.\"",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah, Mitch? How about in greenhouses? Does that count?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, this person who contacted you told you what to do? He gave you this envelope?",
        "Corrine: Never told me his name.",
        "Rex: Was it Mitch? Did it sound like him?",
        "Corrine: I don't remember what Mitch sounded like, and it was on the phone.",
        "Rex: But you believed him -- that this birth certificate is legit, and that Mitch Laurence somehow got with Roxy?",
        "Corrine: Well, I know that my brother was involved with Laurence and those people in the cult when Roxy got pregnant. And the thing about Laurence, he could make anybody do anything. That's what Walter always used to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Jared, no, no!",
        "Mitch: Listen to my daughter, unless, of course, you've grown tired of Natalie and you'd like to watch me slice her throat.",
        "Jared: I swear to God, if you hurt her --",
        "Mitch: Oh, I would never hurt my lovely bride. I have plans for her.",
        "Natalie: You're done here, Mitch.",
        "Mitch: Uh-uh, not anymore. And I do have a weakness for redheads.",
        "Jared: Don't do it, Laurence.",
        "Natalie: He won't. He won't do anything, because if he does anything to us, John McBain will make sure that you rot.",
        "Mitch: Hmm, I wouldn't count on that. John McBain is in Llanview chasing his tail. Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Oh, I shouldn't have eaten that roast beef.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Hey, I'm a little freaked out here, John. This Mitch Laurence -- he's a murderer, a rapist, and he's Jessica's father? I thought Clint was Jessica's dad. She and Natalie, they're twins.",
        "John: Fraternal twins, different father. Laurence is Jessica's biological father.",
        "Brody: How long has she known?",
        "John: I guess for a while now. Apparently, it was a real blow to her and Viki.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Well, no wonder Jessica never mentioned him. All right, so why did he resurface? Where's he been?",
        "John: Dead.",
        "Brody: Excuse me?",
        "John: He was killed 5 years ago, or so everyone thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Dying is underrated, truly. It's only by dying that we are reborn.",
        "Natalie: So, do us all a favor.",
        "Mitch: What, and die? I'm afraid that's out of my hands. No, the Lord still has need of me here on earth.",
        "Jessica: No, you should be dead. Why aren't you dead?",
        "Mitch: Hmm. Well, funny you should ask. I had come to realize that, well, Llanview was no longer open to my teachings, so I made a few arrangements, and I let you and the police believe I had perished.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's where you should be. You should be rotting in hell. Oh!",
        "Mitch: And then I resurrected myself in more hospitable surroundings. And I'm so sorry you were left thinking you had dishonored your father, but daddy's back now. Let the healing begin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Well, what about Evangeline? You were worried how she'd feel if we got together.",
        "Layla: I'm still worried about that. But I'm starting to think that maybe I'm using Evangeline as an excuse because I'm scared of getting hurt again. But then I realized I'm more scared of losing you. So, what do you think? Should we see what's there? I'm just putting it out there. I'd really like it to work with us, but if you don't feel that way, then --",
        "Cristian: Don't go putting words in my mouth.",
        "Layla: So, tell me what you think.",
        "Cristian: What I think?",
        "Layla: Cristian, I don't need you to paint a picture for me. Just yes or \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: So, you want to stay in?",
        "Kyle: If you do.",
        "Oliver: And do what? I mean, we could watch a movie. \"Christina Comes Home for Christmas\" is on TV, and I'm kind of a sucker for those old movies. Or I guess we could just play cards.",
        "Kyle: I've missed you.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Kyle: You know, we don't have to do anything if you don't want. You know, I just want to spend time with you. The rest can wait.",
        "Oliver: I don't want to wait.",
        "Kyle: You sure?",
        "Oliver: I don't want to disappoint you.",
        "Kyle: You couldn't.",
        "Oliver: It's just been a long time. I haven't been with a man since college, since you.",
        "Kyle: I'm sure it'll come back to you. But, you know, we can \u0096",

        "David: Hey, how'd it go with your b-o-y friend?",
        "Destiny: You mean Matthew? It didn't.",
        "David: What happened? Did you chicken out? You promised me that you would tell him how you felt.",
        "Destiny: And I would've, but he was busy, with someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: When was Destiny Evans admitted to the Warwick school?",
        "Headmistress: She wasn't. I know all my students personally, and this girl is not one of them.",
        "T\u00e9a: I just -- I have no idea why she would be here, not that I know her that well, but --",
        "Eli: I thought she contacted you to represent Matthew.",
        "Security Man: Matthew?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, Matthew Buchanan.",
        "Headmistress: He's a student here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Matthew is here?",
        "Headmistress: Yes. And as a matter of fact, he's quite friendly with your daughter.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, my God. Oh, my -- he called me. He called me. He said he was in the UK, that his parents had -- that his parents had forced him to leave the jurisdiction.",
        "Eli: Well, we need to find him. I'm sure he'll know where Danielle is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Your parents are gonna freak.",
        "Matthew: It doesn't matter. I won my lawsuit. As soon as we land on American soil, it's all over. Besides, your mom is gonna freak. She was in the hallway, and you snuck right by her.",
        "Dani: Not the first time.",
        "Matthew: You worried?",
        "Dani: She's just such a lawyer. It's her way or the highway.",
        "Matthew: Same. I mean, we're talking about me walking again, and they won't even give me an inch?",
        "Dani: A quarter-inch. I just said, \"Let me see him again.\"",
        "Matthew: Exactly. It's their fault we're here. If they'd only just met us halfway --",
        "Dani: Or even just listened, absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Well, if things haven't changed, why were you heading home?",
        "Nora: I needed to see you.",
        "Clint: There you go. Now we're on the same page. You know, after we got done talking, I said to myself, \"I don't want to spend one more day without seeing you.\"",
        "Nora: Oh, well, I'm glad that you're here. And -- and Joey and Kevin, they've missed you like crazy.",
        "Bo: And wait till you see Zane. He's a real Buchanan.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah?",
        "Nora: And we've got a lot to talk about.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, if Matthew is as furious as you say he is, we might want to rethink this whole thing from top to bottom. But before we do that, could we have a drink?",
        "Nora: If you don't -- I really would like to just talk to you about this while it's fresh in my mind. Do you mind?",
        "Clint: No, not at all.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Clint: Bo, you'll give us a minute, won't you?",
        "Bo: Sure, unless you want me to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: So Matthew has a new friend. So what?",
        "Destiny: So she's a girl.",
        "David: Not the same girl he borrowed the phone from so he could call you?",
        "Destiny: The same, and she likes him. I can tell.",
        "David: Yeah, but how do you know he likes her?",
        "Destiny: Oh, he likes her. He ran -- I mean, he was running on and on about how she helped him with this and she helped him with that.",
        "[Destiny sighs]",
        "David: Maybe I should get a wheelchair, attract a rich woman with a big heart, small brain. I'm just kidding, you know?",
        "Destiny: Not funny.",
        "David: Hmm.",
        "Destiny: Let's go. Matthew doesn't need us anymore.",
        "David: About that, Destiny, um, you'll be going back to Llanview without me.",
        "Destiny: You're not coming?",
        "David: I'm afraid that my days back there are over.",

        "Layla: I'm sorry. I thought you guys were going out.",
        "Oliver: We are. Well, we were. I was just getting dressed.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah? For what, a toga party?",
        "Kyle: Oliver got called into work. There was some sort of emergency and they were shorthanded. Apparently, it involved digging in the mud. He was kind of a mess when he got back.",
        "Oliver: Sorry. I just had to shower.",
        "Layla: I'll bet.",
        "Oliver: By myself.",
        "Cristian: Right, and if we hadn't shown up...",
        "Oliver: Okay, so I was kissing my boyfriend. Is that a crime? Okay. We're both adults, and we've been waiting for this for a long time -- too long, actually. Whoa. Were you two just kissing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Where's Matthew?",
        "Headmistress: Matthew is not in his room. Apparently, he's left the grounds, as well.",
        "T\u00e9a: A boy in a wheelchair managed to slip past your security forces?",
        "Headmistress: Not without help. Security is questioning his roommate right now.",
        "Eli: You know what? Why don't I go talk to the boy?",
        "Headmistress: He's in the office down the hall.",
        "T\u00e9a: Who are you calling?",
        "Headmistress: Matthew's parents. They're nearby. Perhaps they can shed some light.",

        "Nora: Thank you. I think I can handle this on my own.",
        "Clint: Am I missing something?",
