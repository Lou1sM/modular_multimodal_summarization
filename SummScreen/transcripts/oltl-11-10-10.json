        "Eddie: No plans? How about the zoo? Hmm? Wanna go to the zoo? Or we could throw some football around. Huh? Come on, boys. This is our bonding time between Eddie and his sons. Huh?",

        "Starr: I can't believe that you're saying this.",
        "Cole: I'm serious. I can deal with a lot. I'll have to. But I can't deal with you and Hope coming to a prison. Starr, you're 18 years old. You have your whole life. You have school, you got your family, and someday--",
        "Starr: Don't talk to me like that.",

        "Ford: I have classes to teach.",
        "Eddie: Oh, so that's how it's gonna be, huh? I come all the way from Dayton to spend time with you boys and you don't have anything for me? I mean, after I keep a roof over your head and food in your bellies? What about you, buddy boy? What do you do all day long?",
        "James: I'm in school.",

        "Ford: Yeah, for you.",
        "Eddie: Listen, if he could've managed his money, he wouldn't have had to steal from me. Of course, you know, that's okay. I mean, I--I take responsibility for that. You know, I should've taught him better. It would've been a hell of a lot less trouble for me. You know what I'm saying? Besides, I'm in a forgiving mood today.",
        "Ford: So what do you want? A medal?",
        "Eddie: A little respect, perhaps? I don't know, maybe a bowl and a spoon would be nice. Ah. Thank you. Mm. You know... people say that things happen for a reason. I'm kind of inclined to believe that, because look at us. You know? It's brought us all together. I mean, I used to take care of you when you was little. And now you're gonna take care of me.

        "Kelly: Why? What's your problem?",
        "Rex: Gigi called me, and out of the blue she just starts reaming me out.",
        "Kelly: For no good reason?",

        "Layla: But we don't work on the men's line.",
        "Adriana: It's not about logic. Everything's gone wrong and he needs us.",
        "Cristian: Well, then maybe you can go hold his hand. Layla and I have plans all weekend. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't--I don't know why you'd be asking me this.",

        "Gigi: What's going on over there?",
        "Adriana: Business. I'd stay away. It's gonna get ugly.",
        "Gigi: It's funny how things get ugly for couples when you're around.",
        "Adriana: Funny. The way I remember it, it was you who liked to throw herself in the middle of other couples. Forget it. It's ancient history. I'm sure you and Rex were meant to be. I mean, aside from the sexual problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: That's really stupid of you.",
        "Rex: Thank you.",

        "Rex: It was a casual conversation.",
        "Kelly: Oh, really? Ha ha. Wait a minute. You managed to drop a bomb like that on your ex-wife?",
        "Rex: It wasn't--",
        "Kelly: No. I mean, you tell your ex-wife that you're not having sex with your girlfriend, and that ex-wife gets in your girlfriend's face. I mean, am I right? Am I right?",
        "Rex: Pretty much.",
        "Kelly: Okay.",
        "Rex: I'm screwed, aren't I?",
        "Kelly: Well, apparently not.",
        "Rex: I mean that it's bad.",

        "John: You had an amnio and you didn't tell me?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, it wasn't a big deal, John. I mean, you were busy with work--",
        "John: I'm never too busy.",
        "Natalie: It was a simple test.",
        "John: No. It's not. There are risks.",
        "Natalie: Minor risks, and Dr. Wright's a pro.",
        "John: I don't care. You should've told me. No, as a matter of fact, we should've discussed it first and then decided together.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Maybe so.",
        "John: I shouldn't have to hear this from other people.",
        "Natalie: Believe me, that wasn't my idea.",
        "John: Oh, so you weren't gonna tell me at all. Is that it? How could you do this?",

        "Ford: Hey, you don't get to threaten us like this anymore.",
        "Eddie: Threat? Are you serious? What threat? Did you hear a threat in there? I asked you nice. I was polite and everything. Come on, guys. What--did you feel threatened by me? Come here. Come over here. Mwah. See, this is nothing but love, huh? Ha ha. Ooh. Oh, God. Excuse me.",
        "Ford: It's gonna be fine. There's gotta be a way to get rid of him and we're gonna figure out what it is.",
        "James: How?",
        "Ford: I'm thinking.",
        "James: Well, think fast.",
        "Ford: I will. James, listen to me. We're not little anymore. He can't hurt us the way he used to. [Knocking on door] Remember that. This is as bad as it's gonna get.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You can't stop me from waiting for you. You can't.",
        "Cole: Yeah, maybe you're right. Starr, I'm begging you. Don't. Starr, it's 10 years. 10 years. Do you know how much is gonna change? I'm gonna change. Your life is gonna change completely.",
        "Starr: You and me and Hope. We're a family. And nothing can break us up. Not time, or distance, or even you. I won't let you. I won't let you.",
        "Langston: Thank God you're here.",
        "Markko: We didn't know whether to try here or your mom's or the apartment.",
        "Cole: So you heard?",
        "Markko: How long do you have?",
        "Cole: John's picking me up in about half an hour, maybe less. So we better do this now.",
        "Langston: I can't believe it, Cole.",
        "Cole: Take care of Starr, okay?",
        "Langston: I promise.",
        "Markko: I should've stayed.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Markko: I ran out to L.A., man. I left you.",
        "Cole: Dude, if you wouldn't have gone out to UCLA, I would've kicked your butt all the way out there. That was a chance of a lifetime, man.",
        "Markko: It doesn't count more than friends. If I'd have just been here--",
        "Cole: What? You would've seen me screw up in person? It was gonna happen. Nobody could've stopped me.",
        "Markko: Are you at least gonna get to write letters or something?",
        "Cole: Sure. Hey, so...aren't you working on a new movie or something?",
        "Markko: Always.",
        "Cole: Well, promise me to-- give me a shout-out when you win your first Oscar.",

        "Ford: We're busy.",
        "Inez: You're too busy for some free food?",
        "Ford: Okay, you can leave the bag, but we have to go.",
        "Inez: I can just heat it up for you really, really quick.",
        "James: Okay. I'll do it. Here.",
        "Inez: You shouldn't even be on your feet right now, right?",
        "Ford: Okay. I'll go. But you need to go.",
        "Nate: Why are you being such a jerk?",
        "Eddie: Good question. Ahh. Who's that? Bobby, where's your manners? Ask the whore in.",

        "Brody: Natalie's gonna be my family soon. And she's pregnant.",
        "Natalie: Okay. I think this is a conversation that John and I should have privately.",
        "Brody: Okay. I'll go check on Jessica.",
        "John: Go get some cookies. I'm...at a loss here. How could you do something so risky, so invasive... and not even tell me? Huh? We can't work like this.",
        "Natalie: I wasn't-- I wasn't trying to--",
        "John: To what? Be deceptive? Lie to me?",
        "Natalie: I don't ever want to lie to you, John. I just... I thought that I was protecting you.",
        "John: How's that?",
        "Natalie: I didn't want you to worry.",
        "John: About what?",
        "Natalie: The results. I was gonna tell you as soon as I knew.",
        "John: Knew what? Do I have something to be worried about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: If I say no to my boss, I'll be fired. I know this seems crazy and irrational, but that's the business I'm in. Steffen is a genius and he gave me a huge break. This is why I'm in Paris. This is my shot. Do you want me to miss it?",
        "Cristian: I want you to have everything you want, but I have to know if that includes me.",
        "Rex: Okay, how about this? I take Shane to Moe and Noelle's for a week and I meet Gigi at the airport with a dozen roses and a banana mango smoothie. It's her favorite.",
        "Kelly: Okay. Just wait on the big move, okay? It's gonna take a while for Gigi to get over this, you know? Cool your jets there, cowboy.",
        "Rex: My jets are practically frozen. This isn't about my jets.",
        "Kelly: Okay.",
        "Rex: I feel bad. I know what it's like when Adriana gets in your business.",
        "Kelly: Gigi is gonna get over it, okay?",
        "Rex: Let's hope.",
        "Kelly: So you've really been jet-less?",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah. Jet-free.",
        "Kelly: Not even--",
        "Rex: I'm not saying anything else. I'm sure you can understand why.",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what? If it makes you feel any better...I bet it's been even longer for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Are you mad that Rex told me you two are having a dry spell? That's nothing.",
        "Gigi: Compared to what? What else did he tell you about me?",
        "Adriana: He was very loyal.",
        "Gigi: Never mind. I don't want to talk to you about him.",
        "Adriana: Listen, if it upsets you, then just tell Rex not to come to me.",
        "Gigi: He did not come to you. He-- I took care of it.",
        "Adriana: Is that why you were yelling on the phone just now?",
        "[Adriana laughs]",
        "Adriana: Oh, Gigi. You two are gonna have a long, cold winter.",
        "Gigi: I know it's not my turn, but that's too bad.",
        "Adriana: Turn for what?",
        "Gigi: That.",

        "Rex: Did you just tell me about your sex life?",
        "Kelly: What sex life? Oh, okay. Don't you feel better now?",
        "Rex: How long has it been?",
        "Kelly: A while.",
        "Rex: Okay, what's a while? Like, 8 days?",
        "Kelly: You know, it's really not been a priority in my life. If you ask Dorian, that's my problem.",
        "Rex: You ask Dorian?",
        "Kelly: No, I don't. She tells me voluntarily, at length.",
        "Rex: I mean, come on, how long? Dorian knows. I'm not going to be as pushy as she is.",
        "Kelly: This is not comfortable.",
        "Rex: You just saw me naked, again. It'll be a lot easier than that.",
        "Kelly: Do you think I'm tightly wound?",
        "Rex: No--yes. What?",
        "Kelly: Dorian hired a man to work out all my kinks.",
        "Rex: She bought you a hooker?",
        "Kelly: No! She bought me a masseur.",
        "Rex: A masseur?",
        "Kelly: All right, yeah, he was totally a hooker.",
        "Rex: Hmm. Makes you wonder who else Dorian has in her address book. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Don't get up. Don't get up! I'll put you right back!",
        "Adriana: You trash!",
        "Gigi: I will put you right back!",
        "Adriana: Oh, bring it!",
        "Cristian: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",
        "Adriana: I don't understand what is wrong with her!",
        "Gigi: Please!",
        "Layla: Let it go.",
        "Gigi: You don't fool anyone, Adriana!",
        "Cristian: Gigi, please.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, but your cousin had it coming.",
        "Layla: Can I get some ice? We need to put ice on that now.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, right after I cut a chunk out of Gigi's hair.",
        "Layla: Adriana!",
        "Adriana: What? It'd be an improvement.",
        "Layla: Please, stop. Cris and I have had enough drama for tonight.",
        "Adriana: Layla, it is one weekend. You'll go to Llanview next month to make up for leaving now. You did tell him you're going to Milan?",
        "Layla: I think I have to stay.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Okay.",
