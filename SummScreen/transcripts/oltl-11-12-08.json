        "Natalie: Look, a window. That means there's really an outside.",
        "Jared: Oh, come here. Ah, do you feel that?",
        "Natalie: Yes, fresh air is underrated.",
        "Jared: Oh, I was trying to keep your spirits up down there, but I was scared. And all I could do was hope that we weren't taking our last breaths in that crazy room in the basement.",
        "Natalie: If it had been up to Tess, we would have. We would have been blown to bits. And lovable, wacky Aunt Tina would have let it happen.",

        "TV news anchor: Miraculously, no one was injured and damage to the house was minor, a spokesman from the LPD reported. Fighting broke out --",

        "Jessica: Mom, it's me. It's Jessica.",
        "Viki: Um, okay. You had your baby. May I see the baby, make sure it's all right?",
        "Jessica: I had this -- this isn't my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What's wrong? What happened? Is this because you gave the baby to Marcie? It was harder than you expected, right?",
        "Starr: No. No, it's not that.",
        "Cole: Then what is it, Starr?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I need to be strong for you, Hope. I do, because I know that's what you deserve. You deserve to know what you meant to me. And you deserve so much more life than the little bit you were given. Oh, God, I needed so much to just hold you in my arms and welcome you into this world. You just shouldn't have to hear me say good-bye when you never heard me even say hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Is it the baby? I thought everything was okay. Is it not?",
        "Starr: Cole, our baby did not make it. Our baby is dead.",

        "Marty: No, no, you wouldn't do that.",
        "Todd: No, John is right. You have a son. He's telling the truth.",
        "Marty: I don't -- I don't understand. How could that -- am I really a mother?",

        "Marty: And you knew it and you didn't tell me.",
        "Todd: It's very complicated. I was trying to --",

        "Starr: She was a beautiful little girl. She was just perfect.",
        "Cole: What, I mean, was she -- was she born dead?",
        "Starr: No, she was breathing when she came out. She cried. Dr. Joplin said that there was something wrong with her, but then they came in and said that everything was fine, and now they can't even --",
        "Cole: Hey, hey, hey -- shh. I'm so sorry.",
        "Starr: After the baby was born, I was -- I was happy and sad. I was just all over the place. She had been a part of me for so long, right underneath my heart. She was always a part of me.",
        "Cole: I know.",
        "Starr: You know, without her there it felt empty, but I knew that she was going to have a good life with Marcie. Oh, God, I didn't even get to hold her. They asked me if I wanted to, but I said I couldn't cause it hurt so bad.",
        "Cole: Our baby, she's dead.",
        "Starr: She's not just our baby, Cole, she's Marcie's, too, and this is just gonna kill her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You know, Starr loved you. She loved you enough to entrust you to me. And from the moment she brought you into my life, you were in my heart, right there in my heart. I loved you, and I went to bed dreaming about you, I did. And then I woke up planning your future. You brought me more joy than I could ever tell you, so I want you to know that, okay? Okay, Hope? I want you to know that. So don't you worry, because you did. You had a life. And you will always have a life right here in my heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, you had -- you had your baby.",
        "Jessica: This can't be my baby. I don't remember having it.",
        "Clint: Honey, I promise you, we're going to figure this out.",
        "Jessica: Why don't I remember anything? How did I get to the cottage?",
        "Viki: I -- I think you probably came here to feel close to Nash.",
        "Jessica: You called me, Tess.",
        "Viki: Yes, are you Tess?",
        "Jessica: What? No! God, Mom, no, it's me. It's Jessica.",
        "Viki: Well, forgive me, darling, but we couldn't be sure, you know, you've been Tess for quite a while and she fooled a lot of people, including us.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. Okay, well, then you better take -- take this baby. I don't want Tess to come back out.",
        "Viki: Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, look at you. Look at you. This is a beautiful child, just like Bree.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God, Bree, where is she? Is she okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cain: Who's going to kill you, Tina? And what do you have to do with that explosion at your sister's?",
        "Tina: No, no, no, I can't involve you.",
        "Cain: Precious, if you're in trouble, I want to help.",
        "Tina: Oh, Cain, I wanted to tell someone, anyone. I wanted to tell them so bad. Listen, you see, my niece Jessica, she has this vicious other personality, right? And this vicious other personality locked Natalie up in this secret room that's down in the basement at Llanfair. And, you see, this -- Tess, I mean, that's the vicious other personality. Tess then started to threaten me. She -- she blackmailed me. I mean, she actually threatened to sic Carlo Hesser on Sarah if I didn't do what she said, so I had to do it. So I couldn't help Natalie. And then just as soon as I was going to tell Jared so he could help Natalie, she followed him down there and she locked Jared up in the same place in the same basement. And then -- then I didn't know what I was going to do. And then you showed up. You showed up, and you started swinging around this sledgehammer at me, and then you kidnapped David Vickers and I didn't want David Vickers to die, so I knew I had to get the jewels. And then while we were here -- and we had to help David Vickers deliver the puppies. And then when you had your way with me, well, I think Tess -- then she used the dynamite that I had -- the dynamite that I had that I was going to blow up the safe to get the jewels. She used that to try to blow up Jared and Natalie. And, oh, there now, you are the only other person who knows the whole story.",
        "Cain: You lost me after Jessica's vicious other personality.",

        "Viki: She's fine. You have a little girl. It's Bree's baby sister.",
        "Jessica: A little girl. Nash would've loved a little girl. Are you sure she's okay?",
        "Viki: She seems to be just fine, but we'll get both of you checked out just to make sure.",
        "Jessica: Mom, I'm Jessica. I'm Jessica. I swear I am.",
        "Viki: Okay, okay.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God, I don't want to get lost again. I have another little girl. I'm your daughter. I swear I'm your Jessie.",

        "John: Marty, let's get you out --",
        "Marty: No, I'm not going anywhere. You think just -- oh, my God. I don't -- I don't trust either one of you.",
        "Todd: Marty, just listen to me now, okay? When I first found you remember? And, uh, I discovered that you couldn't remember your past, I thought --",
        "Marty: You thought what?",
        "Todd: I thought that I could use you to get back at everyone who had hurt me",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: How is that feeling?",
        "Natalie: Oh, this? Feels great. Probably doesn't even need a bandage. I just kinda like the attention.",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: You're still worried about her, aren't you?",
        "Natalie: I'm worried about Jessica.",
        "Jared: Yeah, me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Guys, we're going to need an ambulance right away.",
        "Officer: Should be here any minute.",
        "Clint: All right, thank you.",
        "Officer: We'll be right outside.",
        "Clint: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I don't even know what happened. I don't even know how I got here, but you're right. I think that Tess came here to be closer to Nash.",
        "Viki: We're going to get through this, okay?",
        "Jessica: Mom, what happened to me?",
        "Viki: Well, I think Tess gave birth right here in this room.",
        "Jessica: Alone?",
        "Viki: It would appear that way, yeah. I'm so sorry you were alone, darling, but you know what? It's wonderful that you and the baby are doing as well as you seem to be.",
        "Jessica: Is she really okay?",
        "Clint: Yeah, she's okay. Why don't you take a look? Take a look at how beautiful your daughter is.",
        "Jessica: Hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: The doctor said that I could say good-bye to you, but I don't know how to say good-bye.",
        "[Marcie sobs]",
        "Marcie: Mike, help. How am I supposed to say good-bye to you, my little Hope. Oh, God, what am I going to do without her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How long was Tess out?",
        "Viki: Oh, darling, we don't need to deal with that right -- what's wrong?",
        "Jessica: She tried to poison Jared and Natalie, and I -- I had to stop her.",
        "Clint: Jess, Jess, it's okay --",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God, and then she cut the brakes on Natalie's car and you drove it.",
        "Viki: I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine, honey.",
        "Jessica: What about Jared and Natalie? How are they?",
        "Viki: They're -- they're fine, too. They're fine.",
        "Jessica: When? When did Tess do all this?",
        "Clint: Honey, that doesn't matter 'cause we've got you back.",
        "Jessica: Mom, wouldn't you like to know?",
        "Viki: It was July.",
        "Jessica: \"Was\" July? What month is it now?",
        "Viki: November.",
        "Jessica: Five months? Five months? Oh, my God. I can't believe it. How many people did Tess hurt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I don't understand how she -- how she died.",
        "Cole: Me, neither. I never even saw her.",
        "Starr: When she -- when she came out, she let out this big cry. I was so surprised that someone so little could make so much noise. And just -- just for the few minutes that she was in this room, we all just fell in love with her.",
        "Cole: She must have gotten that from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You thought you could use me to get back at everybody, because I was helpless and I couldn't remember anything?",
        "John: Forget about him. Let's just get out of here.",
        "Marty: Shut up. But you took care of me, I mean, every day.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Marty: For what?",
        "Todd: Marty --",
        "Marty: Or maybe you didn't really want me to get better after all.",
        "Todd: No. No, honey, that's all I wanted for you.",
        "Marty: I don't understand. Why were you using me?",
        "Todd: It started out that way, you see, but things have changed. I can't tell you how many times I have tried to tell you this.",
        "Marty: Tell me what?",
        "Todd: How things are. All right. My life was a mess when I found you. Blair had dumped me.",
        "Marty: Because of him.",
        "John: It wasn't because of me, it was because of him.",
        "Todd: Before I found you, I was in the park and I was -- I was watching my kids. I was watching Starr and Sam from a distance because, you know, I couldn't go near them.",
        "John: Your own fault, Manning.",
        "Marty: Then what were you going to do when you rescued me?",
        "Todd: Back then -- do you remember that old Todd? Back then, I wanted to make other people pay for what was wrong in my life.",
        "Marty: Okay, where does my son fit in?",
        "Todd: Well, I hated him.",
        "Marty: Why? Why would you hate my son?",
        "Todd: Because of what he did to Starr.",
        "Marty: What did he do to Starr?",
        "John: Cole committed the crime of falling in love with Starr.",
        "Marty: Cole?",
        "John: And then he got her pregnant.",
        "Marty: Okay, Cole --",
        "Marty: Cole's my son. Cole's my son. Cole is my son.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Marty: Cole is my son.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Marty: So your grandchild is my grandchild.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Marty: I imagined a little boy.",
        "Todd: Mm.",
        "Marty: I imagined -- it was my boy, my little boy.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Marty: I could see him. I was reading to him. It was so clear. And then you --",
        "Todd: Careful.",
        "Marty: You stood there and made me think it was a fantasy.",
        "Marty: Why? You made me think that it wasn't real, but it was real. I have a real memory! I have a real memory! My son -- Cole is my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: When I heard our baby cry, I knew that she was healthy. I knew that she would have a great life with Marcie. And I could see us watching her grow up from far away and having you see your mom in her.",
        "Cole: Starr, don't -- don't.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry.",
        "[Star sobs]",
        "Cole: I'm so sorry. Do, uh, do you want me to get your mom for you or Langston?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Cole: Are you sure?",
        "Starr: I just want you here with me. Just please promise me that you won't leave.",
        "Cole: I promise. I'm not going anywhere, okay? I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Honey, I can only imagine what you've gone through, having your baby here all by yourself.",
        "Jessica: I didn't deliver her, Dad, Tess did.",
        "Clint: Look, we're going to take care of you and we're going to take care of your baby.",
        "Jessica: My baby.",
        "Viki: That's right, darling. She's yours.",
        "Jessica: Can I -- can I hold her? Just -- I miss Nash so much. I just want to see him in our daughter. Hi. Hi. Hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Do you remember when I showed you Cole's picture and what I said? I said I was wrong about this kid.",
        "Marty: You just forgot one thing. You forgot to tell me that he was my son.",
        "Todd: You're right. That's absolutely right. But I knew then and there, I had to figure out a way to let you know this was a real memory, that you are a mother.",
        "Marty: I am.",
        "Todd: Yes, you are. That's why I showed you the picture and I wanted to tell you. I was ready to face it right then and there, to face you, to let you hate me was okay with me.",
        "Marty: So what happened? You decided that you'd gotten away with something, so why shut your mouth? You weren't done using me.",
        "Todd: No, no, it wasn't about that anymore.",
        "Marty: Well, why not? Why quit at a month when you've got a whole lifetime to screw up the people that you hate?",
        "Todd: Listen, I'm not that man anymore. Marty, you have changed me. I wanted to tell you so many times. I was afraid to lose you, honey, so afraid because I love you so much. Do you understand that?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "[Todd scoffs]",
        "Marty: No, I don't. You should've told me.",
        "Todd: [Stammers] I -- I wanted to. I was going to. I just -- it's the circumstances. The doctor called and said that Starr was in labor and one thing after the other.",
        "Marty: Okay, so, wait. You thought that because we were going to get Starr's baby? Is that it? We're about to get her baby, so you thought that that would take place of Cole, of my real baby? That I didn't need --",
        "John: You were what?",
        "Marty: To know about Cole because we were going to raise Starr's baby.",
        "John: You thought you were going to get Starr and Cole's baby?",
        "Marty: Yes, we were. We were -- she had decided to let Todd adopt her child.",
        "John: You told her that?",
        "Marty: That's a lie, too?",

        "Tina: I deserve this after what I did.",
        "Cain: It was a slight lapse in judgment.",
        "Tina: I left one niece trapped in the basement and the other one trapped in her own mind. No, Natalie and Jessica, they deserve better than that from me. I mean, Viki deserves better.",
        "Cain: Okay, well, next time you will do better.",
        "Tina: No, there's not going to be a next time. Don't you see? Look. Here, I want you to have this. Go on, enjoy it. Just pack it up and go and get out of here before they come for me.",
        "Cain: Come with me.",
        "Tina: What?",
        "Cain: Yeah, we'll get rid of the kid and we'll take David Vickers and the little puppies, and we'll high-tail out of this one-horse town.",

        "Michael: Baby, I'm so sorry.",
        "Marcie: It wasn't supposed to happen like this. Mike, it wasn't. Everything was going well. I mean, even Todd, he was -- he was being human.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My dad, he was so sweet to me on the phone before I had the baby. And then he came here, and he was even nice to Marcie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Marcie, my sister-in-law, is going to get Cole and Starr's baby.",
        "Marty: But you told me that fell through. We -- she had decided to give the baby to you. We were going to raise the baby together.",
        "John: Are you insane? How'd you think you were going to keep all this going? How were you going to get the baby from Marcie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You warned me. You did. You warned me that something terrible was going to happen, and it did happen, Michael.",
        "Michael: Marcie, more than anything in this world, I wanted you to be a mother again. I never, ever, ever thought that it would be anything like this. I thought it was going to be Todd. I thought it was going to be Todd who would take this baby away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I was just trying to make everything right.",
        "John: How?",
        "Todd: I knew what I was going to do was all wrong. And tonight was about fixing it, because I couldn't go through with it.",
        "John: What were you going to do, steal the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Maybe if I had been stronger, if I would've believed in us, that we could've raised the baby together --",
        "Cole: Starr, no. It has nothing to do with that. Don't even think that way.",

        "Marcie: If I had fought harder for us, if I'd made sure that we didn't split up, Michael --",
        "Michael: Marcie, there's nothing you could have done, okay?",
        "Michael: It just happened.",

        "Marcie: Why did it happen, Mike?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: But why did this have to happen to us, Cole? Out of everyone in this entire world, why did this have to happen to us? Why did our little girl have to die?",

        "Marty: Tell me he's wrong. Tell me you'd never steal a baby. Oh, my God.",

        "Todd: I'd lost my life at that point. I'd lost my little girl.",
        "Marty: You made my son think that I was dead.",
        "Todd: I'd lost my kids, I'd lost Blair.",
        "Marty: Just, everybody --",
        "Todd: No -- hey, there's no excuse. There is no excuse for what I did! He's right. I was out of my mind and all I could think about was revenge -- against Cole, against him, against anyone who had wronged me. I wanted them all to pay, yes.",
        "John: Be careful with that.",
        "[Marty yells]",
        "John: Stop.",
        "Marty: You stop.",
        "John: Be careful.",
        "Marty: Stop!",
        "John: Listen to me. Listen to me. Why don't you give me the gun? I'm not going to hurt you. I would never hurt you. Just put the gun down.",
        "Marty: I didn't believe a word he said about you. I didn't believe a word, but -- everything you said about him was lies, too, right? He didn't want me dead. He didn't try to kill --",
        "Todd: Nope. No, John didn't want you dead. John is the one who tried to save you.",
        "[Marty whimpers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I saw how you took care of yourself. I saw how afraid you were for the baby when you fell, when your dad --",
        "Starr: When I was on those steps and I was trying to get away from my dad, I said a little prayer to myself. I prayed that nothing would happen to our baby, because I would have done anything to protect her.",
        "Cole: You did everything you could.",
        "Starr: There's just -- there's one more thing I have to do for her. I have to say good-bye.",
        "Cole: Me, too, if that's okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Where are you going?",
        "Marcie: I -- I don't know, Mike.",
        "Michael: Well, wherever you go, I'm going with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Natalie, it's me.",
        "Natalie: Dad? Is everything okay?",
        "Clint: I just wanted you and Jared to know that we found Jessica, and she seems to be okay.",
        "Natalie: Jessica?",
        "Clint: Yeah. Tess is gone for now.",
        "Natalie: Where are you?",
        "Clint: I'm at the hospital, but we found Jessica at the vineyard. Natalie, she had her baby. It's a little baby girl, and we're here making sure that both of them are okay.",
        "Natalie: Really? Dad, please, please, tell Jessica -- give her my love.",
        "Clint: I will definitely do that, honey.",
        "Natalie: Thanks for calling me. It's really nice to be part of a family again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, I would like nothing more than to run off with you and David Vickers and make a family.",
        "Cain: Well, then let's do it.",
        "Tina: I can't. My family's here, here in Llanview. It's Viki and Sarah and my nieces.",
        "Cain: As soon as the heat's off, they'll come visit, all right? And I'll learn how to barbecue.",
        "Tina: Honey, don't you see? They are the heat. They're the people that were hurt by my bad decisions, and I am not going to run away from it. I mean, I've done that my whole life.",
        "Cain: This time it'll be different.",
        "Tina: I don't want to run away. I'm not going to do that, I can't. I have to stay and face the music. I have to do it so I can see my daughter.",
        "Cain: You sure?",
        "Tina: Yeah, I'm sure. Looks like David Vickers and I are going to -- we're going to have to raise those puppies without you. But promise me one thing, okay? Promise me that you'll always think of me on the anniversary of the puppies' birth.",
        "Cain: I'll think of you a whole bunch, way more than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: I've paged the pediatrician -- you can come with me.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Michael, Marcie, what's wrong?",
        "Michael: I'm afraid that Starr's baby didn't make it.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Todd kept telling me that he was protecting me from you, that you wanted me dead.",
        "John: I wanted to get you out of that van, but you wanted me to look for Cole. You were more scared for him than you were for yourself. You wouldn't have it any other way. Cole and I saw the van blow up. We believed you were still inside it.",
        "Marty: So they were just lies, lies to keep me so scared from -- that I wouldn't even look for the real truth.",
        "Todd: It started out that way, but -- I've changed, Marty. And I've fallen for you. And I know that you've fallen for me. And you got better, and so did I. I realize what a creep I've been, all the things I've done. And I wanted to get better. And I got better for you, only for you. I had to try to make things right for you.",
        "Marty: Make things right? What are you saying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Jess, you're going to be all right. You and the baby are going to be just fine.",
        "Jessica: What if Tess takes over again, dad? How do I keep her from coming back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Thank God, no one's here. Bree is back in her crib, safe and sound.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Jared: I say let's get a couple of fat, juicy steaks \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: My God, I don't believe it. How's Starr?",
        "Nurse: The doctor's here to examine the baby.",
        "Viki: Thank you. I'll be right there. How is Starr?",
        "Marcie: Um, oh, she's doing okay. You know, the delivery, it went perfectly. Viki, she did everything right. She did.",
        "Viki: But when I saw her earlier, nobody said the baby was in distress --",
        "Marcie: She wasn't. I don't --",
        "Michael: We don't really know what happened.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.",
        "Marcie: Who's baby was that?",
        "Viki: She's Jessie's.",
        "Marcie: Oh, she had a girl?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I thought I could make up for some of the pain I caused you.",
        "Marty: Four little words. \"You have a son.\" All my pain would have gone away.",
        "Todd: Not all of it, sweetheart.",
        "Marty: What he said before, that you were the ringleader. Say it. It was true?",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Marty: You raped me.",
        "Marty: You? You.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jessica: I miss Nash so much. It's like he died all over again.",
