        "Matthew and Dani arrive at the hospital in Seattle and meet with Dr. Nance. They are all ready to go through with the procedure and confident that he will walk again. Bo and Nora are worried that there's nothing they can do about it. But right then, Bo remembers that Dr. Michael McBain also practices in Seattle. He calls Michael. Marcie is with her husband ready to have her baby. Marcie and Michael see Matthew there and attempt to stall him so that Bo and Nora can get there before it's too late. But Dr. Nance is ready to go through with it. At that same time, T\u00e9a and Elijah are on their flight to find Dani and he asks her why she doesn't admit to Todd that Dani is his daughter. She reveals it's because she knows Todd will never love her. Blair has a similar insecurity of losing Todd to T\u00e9a so she keeps the secret. Todd knows that something is up. Viki and Charlie go to find their kids and are shocked to find out that Mitch Laurence is still alive and behind all of the dastardly deeds that have been going on recently."

        "Nora: I tried calling Clint one more time before we took off.",
        "Bo: He's probably in the air on his way to California.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Some week.",
        "Bo: Matthew runs away. Both Clint's daughters are in trouble. It's -- some week.",
        "Nora: Hmm. You know, if I was a superstitious person, I'd -- it's almost like --",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: Fate, you know -- stepping in, stopping us from telling Clint about us.",
        "Bo: Wish it was all we had to deal with right now.",
        "Nora: We have time, you know, to stop Matthew's operation.",
        "Bo: You think?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Dr. Nance said that Matthew wasn't at the hospital yet. So when he gets there, he's gonna have forms to fill out and tests to take and -- what?",
        "Bo: Unless Nance lied.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Did you see Dr. Nance anywhere?",
        "Dani: He just left a couple minutes ago.",
        "Matthew: How long does it take to put me in the system?",
        "Dani: Are you kidding? Hospitals love paperwork even more than lawyers.",
        "Matthew: I just can't believe this is actually happening. I'm actually gonna walk again.",
        "Dani: How excited are you?",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "Dani: Or are you scared?",
        "Matthew: I just didn't think I'd be doing this alone.",
        "Dani: You're not.",
        "Matthew: Thanks.",
        "Dani: I know it's not the same.",

        "Blair: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Todd: What are you doing here? Hey, I'm talking to you. Don't you have enough to worry about with your wife?",
        "Ross: Lay off!",
        "Todd: I don't think so. I think I'm gonna lay off when I ask you a question. What is T\u00e9a doing in London with Elijah Clarke? I'd like to know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: How much longer?",
        "Elijah: Well, a whole 5 minutes less than the last time you asked. You're not much of a frequent flyer, are you?",
        "T\u00e9a: I just want to see my little girl, okay?",
        "Elijah: I know.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ahh -- huh. I'm just -- I'm relieved that she's in Seattle with Matthew Buchanan and not God knows where with Ross.",
        "Elijah: So what are you gonna do when you find Danielle, I mean now that you have to keep her from Ross and Todd?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I never said I was the perfect mother, okay. But there can be very good reasons for keeping a father away from his own daughter.",

        "Blair: Take your money! Your money!",
        "Todd: What are you guys -- what money?",
        "Blair: No. Ross thinks that T\u00e9a's scamming him just like she tried to scam you.",
        "Todd: Is that right?",
        "Blair: Yeah, and --",
        "Ross: No, no. This has got nothing to do with money.",

        "T\u00e9a: It is the best thing for everyone.",
        "Elijah: Okay, so Todd never gets to know his daughter. Ross spends the rest of his life searching the globe for a kid that isn't even his, and Danielle, who's already losing one father, actually loses two.",
        "T\u00e9a: You got this all figured out, don't you?",
        "Elijah: Seems to me like the only person this is best for is you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha! Yeah. I love dealing with Ross. I love pretending that that crazy, unpredictable man is Daniella's father. I love that.",
        "Elijah: Yeah, almost as much as you love never having to worry about Todd hurting you again, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you care?",
        "Elijah: Hey, I'm just saying.",

        "Nora: Yeah, because that's what we told him.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, but the way he said it, it was like he knew it wasn't true.",
        "Nora: You think he spoke to Matthew?",
        "Bo: Could be.",
        "Nora: Oh, Bo, that means Matthew's already at the hospital. Oh, my God. That means there's nothing we're gonna be able to do to save him.",

        "Matthew: Yeah, but I already feel like we're friends.",
        "Dani: We are. I'll be here the whole time.",
        "Matthew: Thanks.",
        "Nance: Sorry. It took a while to get your insurance cleared. Out-of-state residents require a bit more paperwork.",

        "Michael: Hi. How did the baby like the flight?",
        "Marcie: Not so much. Gave me some particularly hard kicks.",

        "Shaun: I'm the one who works here, so we're gonna talk about what I want to talk about.",
        "Destiny: Okay. What do you want to talk about?",
        "Shaun: How was your class trip to D.C.?",
        "Destiny: There was no class trip. I went to London to see Matthew.",
        "Shaun: Hold up. You lied to Mom and Dad?",
        "Destiny: I had to. Matthew's parents locked him in some boarding school.",
        "Shaun: Where'd you get the money from?",
        "Destiny: My savings account. What? It's mine!",
        "Shaun: So you hopped a plane all by yourself.",
        "Destiny: No. David Vickers came with me.",
        "Shaun: Vickers? That's supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Destiny: Please don't tell Mom and Dad. I had to go. I had to tell Matthew I --",
        "Shaun: You had to tell him what?",
        "Destiny: It doesn't matter. By the time I got there, some girl was helping him escape.",
        "Shaun: Excuse me?",
        "Destiny: They took off to Seattle so Matthew could have his operation, but the doctor isn't as good as Greg.",
        "Shaun: But Greg's not operating on anyone.",
        "Destiny: Maybe he'll listen to you.",
        "Shaun: I doubt it.",
        "Destiny: Look, whatever happened between you can't be that big a deal. Maybe Rachel can help.",
        "Shaun: Rachel can't help because Rachel is what happened between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Well, come in. So, you wanted to see me. Does this mean that we're --",
        "Rachel: I can't be with you. Not as long as it would hurt your brother.",
        "Greg: Well, kind of tough with us both being in the same town.",
        "Rachel: Which is why I needed to see you tonight.",
        "Greg: To let me down easily?",
        "Rachel: To say good-bye. I'm going back to Chicago.",

        "[Charlie blows]",
        "Charlie: Okay, they're alive, but they're unconscious. Someone even went to the trouble of propping their feet up. Did you find anything?",
        "Viki: No. But I don't know. I can't tell. I don't know what happened.",
        "Charlie: Huh.",
        "Viki: That's Jessie's.",
        "Charlie: You think so?",
        "Viki: Well, I'm almost positive, yes.",
        "Charlie: The car doors were open like this?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Charlie: Was the key in the ignition?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Charlie: Well, it looks like she left in a hurry.",
        "Viki: Charlie, I don't know what's going on here. Where is Jessica?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Where is Jared? He was supposed to be here, too.",

        "Natalie: It's Natalie, honey. I'm right here, baby.",
        "Brody: It's a chest wound. All right, Natalie, they want to know if you can feel a pulse in his neck.",
        "Natalie: Uh, no. I don't know. I don't know. I think so. I just -- please tell 'em to hurry.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Yeah. Hurry. Ambulance is on its way.",
        "John: How about Napa PD?",
        "Brody: They're on their way, too, but they, uh, they don't have any units in the vicinity. They said -- I told 'em we could handle it for now.",
        "John: Brody, you got to keep pressure on that wound. Find a towel or something. Natalie, make sure his airway is clear, all right? You know how to do that.",
        "Mitch: That's a little rough.",
        "Natalie: Jared, talk to me. He's not answering me. God, please tell me he's breathing. Tell me he's breathing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I left my whole life in Chicago.",
        "Greg: So what? You don't have a life here in Llanview?",
        "Rachel: I only came back to help my family after Matthew's accident.",
        "Greg: They don't still need your help?",
        "Rachel: My mother's married now. She has Clint.",
        "Greg: And what about Matthew?",
        "Rachel: He's in a boarding school in London. As long as I can dial a phone, it doesn't matter where I live.",
        "Greg: No. Well, it matters to the people that you're counseling at the rehab center.",
        "Rachel: There are other counselors.",
        "Greg: Okay, uh, it matters to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Greg is going after your woman?",
        "Shaun: Looks like Rachel was never my woman.",
        "Destiny: But you got all dressed up. You took her out to dinner. You bought her flowers.",
        "Shaun: Guess Greg bought her better ones.",
        "Destiny: That is cold. But he is still our brother.",
        "Shaun: That doesn't mean I have to deal with the man.",
        "Destiny: But he saved your life.",
        "Shaun: Yeah, after he put me in a coma and kept me out long enough to get Rachel for himself.",
        "Destiny: Greg wouldn't do that.",
        "Shaun: How do you know?",
        "Destiny: The same way I know Rachel would never two-time anyone.",
        "Shaun: You have no idea what someone will do when a prettier face comes along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nance: When did you last eat, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: You know, I was so freaked out I don't even remember.",
        "Dani: Oh, we didn't eat on the flight. It's been, like, 9 hours at least.",
        "Nance: Okay, good. Okay, I have to consult with the anesthesiologist. Then we'll get you prepped.",
        "Matthew: Tonight?",
        "Nance: You've waited long enough.",
        "Dani: It's finally happening.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, and my parents are totally clueless.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well, sure, Bo, I'll do whatever I can.",
        "Bo: Well, thanks, Mike. I'll let you know as soon as we get there.",
        "Marcie: Matthew ran away? And he came here?",
        "Michael: Yeah. That's what Bo thinks. I mean, he's really desperate to have the surgery on his spinal cord injury. Dr. Nance is willing to perform it so -- Bo and Nora are scared to death.",
        "Marcie: Of course, but, I mean, you don't have the authority to stop it, do you, mike?",
        "Michael: No. Bo and Nora just want me to stall until they can get here. I better check the surgical schedule, see how much time we got.",
        "Marcie: Matthew might not even be here.",
        "Michael: Oh. He's here.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: He's breathing, but it's shallow and he's lost a lot of blood.",
        "John: Keep pressure on that wound.",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "John: All right, you make sure he's warm, all right, and doesn't go into shock.",
        "Jessica: What can I do? Tell me, tell me. What can I do?",
        "Brody: Wait at the house and show the EMTs where we are.",
        "Jessica: I'm on it.",
        "Natalie: Stay with me. Listen to my voice.",
        "Mitch: He's not good enough for you, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: I'm right here, baby. I'm not gonna go anywhere.",
        "Mitch: He doesn't deserve you, and soon he will not have you.",
        "Natalie: Somebody shut him the hell up!",
        "Brody: Natalie, stop!",
        "Natalie: Jessica killed him.",
        "Mitch: And I have risen again.",
        "Natalie: You should have stayed dead. You're a monster!",

        "Charlie: Battery's dead.",
        "Viki: Well, then Jessie probably went to get help. But -- but it doesn't explain the phone.",
        "Charlie: No, it doesn't. Oh, wait. Here. I just want to know what is going on here.",
        "Viki: Charlie, I know what you're worried about. There is absolutely no reason to suspect Jared.",
        "Charlie: No. I know Jared would never ever do anything to hurt Jessica.",
        "Viki: No, he would not!",
        "Charlie: Okay, but where is he? I mean, I can't just sit and wait.",
        "Viki: I know, darling, but we don't even know where to begin.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but I can't do nothing. I mean, I have to find my boy.",
        "Jessica: Mom? Charlie?",
        "Viki: Baby!",
        "Charlie: Are we glad to see you.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right. Where's Natalie?",
        "Jessica: She's here. She's fine. She's fine.",
        "Charlie: And how about Jared? What, is he okay?",
        "Jessica: I'm so sorry. He's been shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why did you shoot him? I love him! He's my husband!",
        "Mitch: I am your husband, Natalie, and soon we will renew our vows.",
        "Brody: Oh, shut up.",
        "Mitch: What, I can't look forward to reuniting my family? You and me, Natalie, and my little girl Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Jessica is not your daughter.",
        "Mitch: Well, I admit it is a bit confusing. You'll be your own sister's stepmother. Ha ha! I shudder to think -- oh!",
        "John: You were saying?",
        "Natalie: Thank you. Where is that damn ambulance?",
        "Brody: Natalie, you need to keep talking to him.",
        "Natalie: Okay, okay. Jared, I'm right here, baby. Please, don't leave me, okay? Just don't leave me. Don't leave me, okay? Just don't leave me.",

        "Todd: T\u00e9a's in London with Elijah Clarke, who happens to be your brother?",
        "Ross: Yeah, but I have to find him.",
        "Todd: Why do you have to find him? Because of the money?",
        "Blair: Well, isn't it obvious?",
        "Todd: No, it's not obvious! That's why I'm asking the question.",
        "Blair: No, listen. Elijah is as big a snake as Ross is. He's been fooling around with his brother's wife.",
        "Todd: Really?",
        "Blair: Yeah, and she's playing you both for fools.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: All right, I got to take this. I'm not done with you. Are you gonna be okay out here by yourself?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I think he's learned his lesson.",
        "Ross: What is wrong with you?",
        "Blair: Me?",
        "Ross: Yeah, you. Why wouldn't you let me tell him that T\u00e9a's been keeping my daughter from me?",
        "Blair: Because I'm -- if Todd finds out that T\u00e9a has a child, well, he might feel sorry for T\u00e9a.",
        "Ross: You think?",
        "Blair: Yeah. And you know what else, he might try to -- she'll try to talk him into helping keep your daughter away from you, and you don't want that, do you?",
        "Ross: Just like you don't want Todd having anything to do with T\u00e9a, yes.",
        "Blair: Okay, so now we have a reason to help each other out. Just don't tell Todd about your daughter, and I will help you find her.",

        "Todd: T\u00e9a's on a plane? Where? Seattle? What's in Seattle?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Look, if you ask me, you should pick up Danielle in Seattle, fly her back to Llanview and introduce her to her real father.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I don't remember asking you.",
        "Elijah: You obviously still love the guy. I mean, you married him.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Scoffs] So what? True love conquers all?",
        "Elijah: Wow, when did you become so cynical?",
        "T\u00e9a: You mean realistic?",
        "Elijah: Look, as far as I can tell, the only problem is you lied to him about his daughter. It shouldn't be that hard to make him understand why.",
