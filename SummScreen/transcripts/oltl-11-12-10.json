        "Kelly: What the hell was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Both: Whoa.",
        "Gigi: Where did that come from?",
        "Cristian: I have no idea, but I'm thinking--I don't know. The champagne, the view, Paris.",
        "Gigi: You haven't been, all this time--you haven't been looking at me and--",
        "Cristian: No. No, no. I mean, not that you're--",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "Cristian: What about you?",
        "Gigi: Me?",
        "Cristian: Have you been thinking of me--",
        "Gigi: No, never, not that you're not--",
        "Cristian: It's the champagne. Good stuff.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, definitely. Definitely the champagne.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. So now what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What the hell was that? You kissed me.",
        "Kelly: I didn't see you trying to stop me.",
        "Rex: I'm sorry. I must be drunker than I thought. There's no way that I would ever--",
        "Kelly: Oh, really?",
        "Rex: Just please accept my apologies. I didn't know what I was doing.",
        "Kelly: Could've fooled me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Can't take back that kiss.",
        "Gigi: What do you mean?",
        "Cristian: Gigi, we're in Paris. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?",
        "Gigi: Huh?",
        "Cristian: What do you say we go back to my room, rip off all our clothes, and have wild French sex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: That kiss was an impulse because--where the hell is Echo DiSavoy? She was supposed to tell me something about my parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Echo, we've waited long enough. Now who are Rex Balsom's parents?",
        "Echo: Your wife needs a new hobby, Chuckles.",
        "Viki: I'm pretty sure I already know the answer. I just want to hear it from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What were you going to say before?",
        "Ford: I was just wondering if maybe--",
        "Dorian: Good night, Mr. Ford. Langston wants nothing to do with you.",
        "Langston: That is not true.",
        "Dorian: I beg your pardon?",
        "Langston: You heard what I said. It's not true that I don't want anything to do with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I didn't think I'd be here myself, but I had to get out of the house.",
        "John: I know that was hard, being at Statesville today.",
        "Marty: It was hell, but I think I've found a way to cope.",
        "Natalie: I'm so sorry about Cole.",
        "Marty: Me, too.",
        "John: That kid's had it rough.",
        "Marty: And now so will Natalie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Starr. Starr. Starr.",
        "Starr: Make love to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Langston, all of the excitement has gone to your head. She doesn't know what she's saying.",
        "Langston: Okay, don't speak for me.",
        "Dorian: You aren't making any sense. She told all of the Cramer women that she was through with you. She made a vow.",
        "Langston: No, you made a vow. I never promised anything.",
        "Dorian: Did you put something in her drink?",
        "Langston: No, he didn't put anything in my drink.",
        "Ford: I would never drug anybody, and I resent the fact--",
        "Dorian: You need to go home.",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Dorian: Young lady, you need to be with your family at a time like this, and your family needs you. Poor Starr. Cole is headed to prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Whoa, whoa. Hey, just slow down a second.",
        "Starr: Why? Why?",
        "James: Starr, stop! Let's talk about this.",
        "Starr: I don't want to talk! I don't want to talk.",
        "James: Hey. Cole just left for prison, Starr. What are you doing?",
        "Starr: This is what he told me to do. He wants me to be with you.",
        "James: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I'm sorry about earlier.",
        "Nora: Earlier?",
        "Bo: Yeah, when I had to take off with Inez to help talk to her son because her ex-husband, the car thief--he beats this rap in Dayton, and then he shows up on the boys' front step. She's worried about her sons, so she asked me to have a little talk with the old man.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, that makes sense.",
        "Bo: Ow. Why is your jaw clenched so tight? Aw, come on, honey.",
        "Nora: Oh, say, isn't that that handsome, young attorney from the D.A.'s office? Maybe I should go show him how to work the copying machine. Ha ha ha!",
        "Bo: Why don't you tell me his name, and maybe I'll arrest him.",
        "Nora: Hey, as long as it's me you're coming home to.",
        "Bo: Always. Are we good?",
        "Nora: Maybe I should show him where to put the toner.",
        "Bo: No, how about I show you where to put the toner?",
        "Nora: Mmm. I don't mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I'm sorry you missed Danielle sing. She was amazing.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Sorry I missed that.",
        "Inez: Everything okay?",
        "Clint: Everything's fine. It's all under control",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know something about Rex's parents. Why don't you just drop your little bomb? That's why you're here, right?",
        "Clint: Rex broke into the offices of Buchanan Enterprises. He was caught red- handed. That's called corporate espionage. It carries with it a lengthy penalty, so whenever I wish, I could send him away for a long, long time.",
        "Echo: I'm here to work. Smile.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You're gonna blame the kiss on Echo DiSavoy?",
        "Rex: No, I'm just not myself because of Echo DiSavoy.",
        "Kelly: Well, yourself is not to blame. I'm the one who leaned in first.",
        "Rex: I kissed you back.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, you did.",
        "Rex: I shouldn't have.",
        "Kelly: Why?",
        "Rex: Because I'm with Gigi.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. She's in Paris.",
        "Rex: Yeah, doing who knows what with some Frenchman. What if Gigi's still mad at me for telling Adriana that we haven't had sex yet that she jumps on the first guy she sees?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Cristian, you're engaged to Layla, remember?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, I remember. I don't think she does.",
        "Gigi: Sure, she does.",
        "Cristian: Then where is she, huh? I fly halfway across the world to be with her, and she dumps me for some Milanese male models. Milanese male models. That's not so easy to say when you've had as much champagne as we've had.",
        "Gigi: Milanese male models.",
        "Cristian: And besides, I paid a small fortune to upgrade to a king-sized bed and a hot tub and a view of the Eiffel tower. Why should we let all that luxury go to waste, huh?",
        "Gigi: You know what? It would serve Rex right after what he did to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know what? I'm starving. Do you want to hit the buffet?",
        "John: What was that you just said? Natalie's gonna have it rough?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you know what? I think she was talking about the baby. It's a lot of work.",
        "Marty: That's a nice try, but actually, John, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Your girlfriend is a liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You don't know what you're saying right now, okay?",
        "Starr: Yes, I do.",
        "James: Starr, listen to me. You are not ready for this, not right now. Your life is a mess, okay? You were just kidnapped twice. Hope's babysitter was murdered. Your daughter's life was threatened, Starr. You watched me get buried alive, and you were almost killed yourself. And now your boyfriend is being shipped off to prison for 10 years, okay? You don't want to just start something new. That's not what you want.",
        "Starr: It's what Cole wants!",
        "James: What do you mean?",
        "Starr: He told me--he broke up with me, okay? He wants me to move on. He wants me to forget about him with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know what? It's been a long day. Marty had to say good-bye to her son, which I know wasn't easy, and nothing means more to you than your child, so why don't we just say good night?",
        "Marty: Is that what you want, John--just to say good night?",
        "John: No. I want to know why you're calling Natalie a liar.",
        "Marty: Why not? Oh, no, no. Shoot. That's right. Because she's miss honesty, except she isn't. Your pregnant girlfriend here is a liar, and I can prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Dorian, my relationship with Ford is none of your business.",
        "Dorian: He doesn't have relationships. He has conquests, lots of them.",
        "Ford: You don't know the first thing about me or your daughter.",
        "Langston: Ford, I--",
        "Ford: Listen. Langston doesn't want you running her life, so how about you back off and let her speak for herself?",
        "Dorian: Young man, you have no idea with whom you are dealing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I can see her now, sitting on the lap of some champagne-swilling, beret- sporting, frog-eating French guy in a cafe on the west bank.",
        "Kelly: Left bank, in this case.",
        "Rex: Wherever.",
        "Kelly: Whoo! Gigi will get over it. So you were a little indiscreet with Adriana. So what? Who cares?",
        "Rex: You don't know Gigi. That girl is stubborn and impulsive. She could be married and divorced by the time she gets back. Not that I don't have my moments. That kiss.",
        "Kelly: I kissed you.",
        "Rex: Why did you?",
        "Kelly: It was an experiment. I lost my spark. It's just gone. I was hoping maybe you could help me fire it up again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: If Rex can sleep with Kelly, I can sleep with you, right? So come on. Let's light up that king-sized bed, and that hot tub--fill her up. Bring on the overpriced champagne because we're gonna drown in it.",
        "Cristian: You know, beer has got bubbles, too.",
        "Gigi: His favorite beer. It'll serve him right.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Layla, too. Her and her Maltese models.",
        "Gigi: Millioneze.",
        "Rex: Yeah, them, too. When did you get so sexy?",
        "Gigi: Me? I don't know. Maybe it's the champagne.",
        "Cristian: It's working. We gonna do this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Come on, Commissioner. Act like you love the woman. There you go.",
        "Viki: Do you see that? She refused to answer my question. Obviously, she's hiding something.",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Viki: No, darling, it is not okay. She knows something. She as much as admitted it, didn't she? And she promised Rex that she would give him answers about his parents.",
        "Charlie: She promised Rex--not you, not me.",
        "Viki: But you are involved, or you could be involved, and she knows that. Otherwise, she would have answered my questions. Sweetheart, we cannot hide from the truth. You said it yourself. Far too many people are affected by this.",
        "Charlie: Echo, can I have a minute?",
        "Echo: I'm just--",
        "Charlie: I know, but this won't take long. I just--look. I don't want to pry into your personal business, but Viki seems to think that there's a possibility that you might be Rex's mother with me as the father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: So if you know what time you want to be over there, then I'll make sure that the boys get Eddie home.",
        "Clint: Who's Eddie?",
        "Inez: He's my ex-husband. He's managed to avoid jail. He's a car thief, and now he's forced his way into living with my sons.",
        "Bo: Inez asked me if I could rattle his cage a little bit, see if we could get him to head back home to Dayton.",
        "Inez: Yeah. He's got a very violent temper, and I don't want him anywhere near my children.",
        "Clint: I can certainly understand that. What I can't understand is, why didn't you ask me to handle it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay, can we not do this here, please? Everybody's just trying to have a good time.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no. Mr. Ford is far too concerned with his own good time to care about anybody else's.",
        "Ford: Listen, your daughter and I might have some history, but it has nothing to do with you, so I'll repeat myself. Back off.",
        "Dorian: Langston is my daughter, and I will not be told to back off, not by the likes of you.",
        "Langston: Oh, my--",
        "Dorian: I would protect her with my life, and if you choose to fight me, you will not win.",
        "Ford: You don't scare me, Mayor Lord.",
        "Dorian: Oh! You know, I have security guards who could break that terrific jaw of yours with one punch.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. It was you. You were the one who had Ford beat up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm sure my little brother would be happy to help, but why involve the police? I can be very persuasive. Let me take care of your ex-husband.",
        "Bo: Inez was right to come to me. This is a police matter.",
        "Clint: Yeah, but the guy beat the charges. What are the police gonna do?",
        "Bo: What are you gonna do? Go after a guy with your shotgun? That's the last thing they need, Clint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I understand if Cole wants you to move on with your life, okay? But I can guarantee he didn't mean tonight.",
        "Starr: You don't want me.",
        "James: Starr, come on. You know how much I want you. Just--just not like this, okay? Not when you're heartbroken over Cole, not when you're angry about how things turned out. This isn't what you want, Starr. I know it isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What are you talking about? You've got a ton of spark. Look at you. Yowsa. You're hot.",
        "Kelly: Sorry. No sale.",
        "Rex: Why not? Because you haven't gone skydiving in the last week or bungee jumping or tornado tracking?",
        "Kelly: I'm a reporter, not a weather girl.",
        "Rex: Yes, that's my point. You've got an awesome career. You got a smoking-hot body, in or out of a towel, plus you've got family, friends, money. You got it all.",
        "Kelly: Then why do I feel so disconnected?",
        "Rex: Well, maybe because you're lonely.",
        "Kelly: Lonely? I thought you just said I have work and family and friends.",
        "Rex: Right, but you said it yourself. There's no guy.",
        "Kelly: Right. No guy.",
        "Rex: So maybe that's why you're a little drifty.",
        "Kelly: That's exactly it. I'm drifty. I'm drifty. I'm drifty.",
        "Rex: But you've got to know that you can have anybody you want, as long as they're available--single, not married.",
        "Kelly: I know what the word means.",
        "Rex: So get out there. As soon as you figure it out, what it is that you want, it'll happen.",
        "Kelly: Just like that?",
        "Rex: Just like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: There's something you need to see, John.",
        "Natalie: What is that?",
        "Marty: It's a record of a medical test you had done, and it's gonna show your little girlfriend here in a whole new light. For someone that couldn't possibly bend the rules so that my son could avoid going to a penitentiary for 10 years, it turns out that she's only honest when it suits her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You're right. I don't want any part of you, not now and not ever.",
        "James: You don't mean that.",
        "Starr: I want my life back the way it used to be when Cole and I were together and when Langston and Markko, we all lived together. We were happy. We had everything. We had a daughter and family and friends and-- can you give that to me? No. So what good are you? Get out. Get out. I never want to see you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What is this?",
        "Marty: Well, you're aware that Natalie had an amniocentesis last week. If you read the instructions to the lab--",
        "John: Are these the results? Is there something wrong with the baby?",
        "Marty: No, not the results, just the record of the test that she--",
        "John: Look. I already know you had amnio. Why do you have a copy of it?",
        "Natalie: How the hell did you get your hands on my medical records?",
        "Marty: Oh, you know, it-- on my desk by mistake, and as John's friend--",
        "Natalie: As John's friend, you show up at a party that we're at and bring my medical records with you so that you can prove that I'm a liar?",
        "Marty: You are a liar. Read it.",
        "John: Natalie already told me why she did what she did.",
        "Marty: Are you sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So what are we gonna do? We gonna go upstairs?",
        "Gigi: What do you want to do?",
        "Cristian: Ha ha ha! I asked you first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: So you really think I've got some spark?",
        "Rex: And then some.",
        "Kelly: You know something, Rex? You are a pretty terrific guy. It's too bad you're taken. You're smart. You're funny. You look good in or out of a towel, but you are Gigi's.",
        "Rex: If she ever speaks to me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Much as I'd love to test-drive that hot tub with you in it--",
        "Cristian: You're in love with Rex.",
        "Gigi: And you're in love with Layla, who, I must say, is crazy because you're, like, 10 times handsomer than any Milanese male model, and they're probably too into themselves to even notice her, so no worries, okay?",
        "Cristian: I just miss her.",
        "Gigi: I know. That's why I have to say no.",
        "Cristian: You know, Rex is a lucky guy.",
        "Gigi: I will remind him of that when I see him, right after I kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Gigi is crazy about you.",
        "Rex: So why doesn't she call me back?",
        "Kelly: Well, I don't know. Isn't she working?",
        "Rex: She's in Paris. It's the middle of the night with the time change.",
        "Kelly: So she's asleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Thank you.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Cristian: For keeping me from doing something stupid. Yeah. I'm mad at Layla-- this trip meant a lot to me--but that's no reason to cheat on her. We're engaged. That's serious.",
        "Gigi: I wouldn't know.",
        "Cristian: You and Rex will get there. Besides, it wouldn't be fair to you. I'm your boss. That's a no-no.",
        "Gigi: Guess we dodged a bullet.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. We did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: So should we call it a night?",
        "Rex: If you want to.",
        "Kelly: You couldn't have had that much fun. Echo bailed on you. Gigi is ticked at you. Don't you want to go home and channel-surf?",
        "Rex: Come on. We're on a date.",
        "Kelly: Forget it. You have already found your perfect woman.",
        "Rex: And I'm gonna help you find yours...man, that is, unless there's something I don't know.",
        "Kelly: Tsk. He's a man, and you know what? I've already found him.",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. Joey Buchanan. He was my first love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Echo, look. We know for a fact that you and Charlie slept together 9 months before Rex was born, okay? We know for a fact that you were in Llanview the day Rex was abandoned at the hospital. You got a speeding ticket leaving town...",
        "Echo: You don't know where I was headed.",
        "Viki: And we know for a fact that you have the other half of the necklace that someone tucked into Rex's blanket when she left him at the hospital.",
        "Charlie: You've got to admit, it does look like Rex Balsom is our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Natalie didn't tell me about the test because she knew that I'd worry, given that I'd already had a loss, our loss.",
        "Marty: Oh. Oh, nice. I see how she was trying to spare your feelings. John, I really need you to take a closer look at this.",
        "John: I know you've had a rough day. I know you're worried about Cole, and you're angry with Natalie because she didn't allow you to take the blame, but this is not the way to go about it. It's not her fault. You're gonna have to let this go, Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Starr--",
        "Starr: Just leave, okay?",
        "James: No. No way.",
        "Starr: Because you're right. I don't want this. Just do us both a favor and get lost because now I'm just gonna have to go back to Cole, and I'm going out to tell him that, \"I'm sorry it didn't work out. You're gonna have to find me a new boyfriend and a new guy to be hope's father. Go. Just leave me alone, you're not helping me. I don't want you here. I don't want you here.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You have been nothing but good to me and Hope. I'm just so-- it's so sad.",
        "James: You have a very good reason to be.",
        "Starr: He's Hope's father. She's barely going to see him for the next 10 years. How am I supposed to explain that to her?",
        "James: You're angry. I get it.",
        "Starr: No, I'm not. I'm not angry. It's just not the way it's supposed to be. We were so close. I got into L.U. We had family to watch Hope. Everything was perfect, and then he had to--",
        "James: What? He had to what?",
        "Starr: Doesn't matter. It's over.",
        "James: Is it?",
        "Starr: He thought that we were dead, so he lost it, and I don't blame him, but I would never-- Eli was handcuffed. The police had him in custody. There was absolutely no way of him getting off, and he steals a gun, and he shoots Eli. Why? Why would he do that? He ruined his life, and now I have to raise Hope on my own without him for what? Do you have any idea how-- I'm so angry! Uh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: No, John. You don't understand.",
        "John: You don't understand. Cole's prints are in the system. The lab would've made a match with the prints on the gun. I know this is hard to hear. Cole made a bad mistake, and he knows it. It's why he pled guilty, and you're gonna have to accept that. You're just making it worse for him by letting this torture you like this.",
        "Marty: This is not his fault. I'm the one who spoke for Hannah.",
        "John: I know. You're not perfect. You're not perfect. Nobody is.",
        "Marty: No. Maybe not, but you don't deserve this, John, and I care about you.",
        "John: I care about you. I do, okay, but this isn't you. You're a good person, Marty. You got a good heart. You've just been pushed to your limit. You've lost too much. This isn't gonna get it back, and when you've had a chance to deal with all this, you'll see that.",
        "John: Are you okay to get home on your own?",
        "Marty: I'm always okay.",
        "Natalie: Stay out of my personal records.",
        "Marty: Ha ha! Okay, and you have a good night.",
        "Natalie: She's never gonna let this go.",
        "John: Give her time.",
        "Natalie: I'm exhausted. Can we just go home?",
        "John: You bet. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm almost sober. Must be because we decided to behave ourselves. Can you picture it--you and me having wild, crazy sex in a Parisian penthouse, but when we got home, then--",
        "Cristian: You're right. You're right. You're right. It's almost dawn. Time for bed.",
        "Gigi: Do you really think I'm sexy?",
        "Cristian: Very sexy. Do you think I'm handsomer than a Milanese model?",
        "Gigi: A million times handsomer.",
        "Cristian: You see? That's sexy, and Rex knows it.",
        "Gigi: He better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Joey Buchanan?",
        "Kelly: I know that you are not a big fan of his because of everything that happened with Jen Rappaport, but we had a good thing way back when.",
        "Rex: When you first came to Llanview.",
        "Kelly: Oh, poor Joey. I had just gotten kicked out of boarding school, and he was my tutor, and he had a kind of crush on me, only I was crushing hard on David Vickers, if you can believe it. He was kind of cute back then, not that he had much use for me. So I decided to throw myself at Joey, and I had this idea that he could help me get rid of my virginity. Anyway, I was a complete mess, and Joey had the good sense to say no, which probably had more to do with the fact that he was coming off an affair with Dorian than anything else.",
        "Rex: Dorian.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I most certainly did not have Ford beaten up. How could you think such a thing?",
        "Langston: You just said that you would have your bodyguard break his jaw.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Ford: No. Dorian had nothing to do with it. Somebody else, somebody you don't know.",
        "Dorian: Well, thank you. I don't suppose you'd like to tell us who it was. I'd love to give them a medal. They did the town a great public service.",
        "Langston: Whoa, will you please just give it a rest?",
        "Man: Excuse me, Mayor Lord.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you. This is not over.",
        "Langston: Sorry about that.",
        "Ford: You just told Dorian you weren't through with me. Did you mean it, or were you just saying that to irritate her?",
        "Langston: Truth is, I still have feelings for you.",
        "Ford: I still have feelings for you, too. So can we start over?",
        "Langston: I don't know, Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Yeah. The Dorian-Joey thing was kind of weird. Once Joey got past it, we were pretty happy. It was good. That's when I had the spark, when I felt like anything was possible, but then once Joey left town, it kind of all went south for me.",
        "Rex: So get him back.",
        "Kelly: Joey? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Too much has happened. I was with his brother and his nephew.",
        "Rex: Well, that's all in the past, though, right?",
        "Kelly: No. No. It's too late.",
        "Rex: Listen, listen. I don't know anything about you and Joey, but I do know that I thought that I'd lost Gigi for good, and look at us now.",
        "Kelly: Ha ha ha!",
        "Rex: Or next week when I've talked her into forgiving me and she's back. The point is--",
        "Kelly: No. I will think about it.",
        "Rex: All right. Well, I should go track down Echo, see what I can pry out of her.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I'm gonna stay up here and clear my head.",
        "Rex: So we okay, huh? That kiss...",
        "Kelly: Was my fault. Rex, you and I are friends, okay? We're gonna hang on to our towels from now on. Good luck with Echo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Look. It's been fun, but I'm a working girl, and I have pictures to take, so if you'll excuse me--",
        "Viki: No. No. You're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Dorian is right. You hurt me, and I hurt you. I got you fired.",
        "Ford: Yeah, but now I'm back at the university.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but what we had, it wasn't a relationship. It was just sex.",
        "Ford: You just said that you had feelings for me, and I have feelings for you, too, so--",
        "Langston: I know, but it takes more than just feelings to have a relationship, and that's what I want.",
        "Ford: I've never been in a real relationship before.",
        "Langston: Is that supposed to be an excuse?",
        "Ford: No. I'm not trying to make excuses. I'm just saying this is what I did to survive, okay, and--you're right--a lot of time, I get in my own way, but I am willing to rethink this for you. I got to go home.. I don't want James to be alone with Dad for--",
        "Langston: Yeah. I should go check on Starr.",
        "Ford: Hey... see you soon.",
        "Langston: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How did my records get from obstetrics to Marty's desk in the psych ward?",
        "John: I don't think it's the psych ward.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Whatever, a whole other department.",
        "John: Do you really want to keep talking about this?",
        "Natalie: She's harassing me, John.",
        "John: Listen. I'm gonna tell you what I told her. Let it go, all right? You had a test. We're waiting for the results, and let's just let it go from there.",
        "Natalie: She ruined our night.",
        "John: Who says it's ruined, hmm?",
        "Natalie: Ha ha ha!",
        "John: Nobody is spoiling what we got, okay?",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey, it's me. I wish you were here. I wish you had picked up. I wanted to say this to you and not your voice mail. I love you, Layla, and I'm really sorry about the fight. I really am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Oh, Natalie obviously doesn't know who the father of her baby is. How could she cheat on John? Well, he'll know the truth soon enough. She took you away from me... so it's only fair that she loses John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I can't even hate him because I love him, but he's right. It's over, and it has to be. I can't keep pretending that he's around when he isn't, and I don't know what he'll be like when he gets out of prison. He could be a completely different person.",
        "James: Listen. You have to just take it one day at a time, okay? Look. Think about you and Hope. That's what he wants.",
        "Starr: Well, he should've thought of that before he shot Eli Clarke, but no. He had to assume the worst, just like he always does, and now I'm alone.",
        "James: Hey, you are not alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: Clint, you've already done a lot for me, and Eddie is a criminal, so I'd feel much better if the police handled him...",
        "Clint: All right. You know best.",
        "Inez: Which is why I think I should call it a night.",
        "Clint: No, no, no. The party is just getting interesting.",
        "Inez: Oh, no, no, no. I have to get up very early for work tomorrow. Thank you again.",
        "Bo: Don't mention it.",
        "Clint: Well, at least let me drive you home.",
        "Inez: No. Don't be silly. You stay and enjoy the party. Good night.",
        "Clint: Good night.",
        "Bo: Good night.",
        "Nora: Oh, now, now, boys. Play nice. There's plenty of Inez to go around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Let go of my arm.",
        "Viki: You owe us an answer.",
        "Echo: I don't owe you anything.",
        "Bo: What's going on?",
        "Echo: This woman is harassing me.",
        "Viki: Bo, she knows who Rex's parents are, and she's refusing to tell.",
        "Bo: Is that true, Echo? You have information about Balsom's parents?",
        "Clint: Now you're harassing her, too? Would you leave the poor woman alone?",
        "Viki: We have the right to know.",
        "Clint: Says who, Viki? What's this to you?",
        "Viki: Charlie is my husband.",
        "Clint: And what's Charlie got to do with Rex Balsom?",
        "Bo: That's what I'd like to know right now.",
        "Echo: All right. You're right, Viki. I am Rex Balsom's mother."
