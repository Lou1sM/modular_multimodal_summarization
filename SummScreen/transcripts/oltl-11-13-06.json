        "Antonio is just inside the door to where Jessica and Nash are talking. They discuss her telling Antonio the truth about her. He knows that she had doubts about the wedding and asks her to admit it. Antonio waits to hear her response from his hidden position. Vincent understands now. The bandaged man has managed to blurt out his name. \"I am John!\" Vincent wheels away stunned as if burned by an iron. He understands no. All the times that John was squirming around, uncomfortable by things that were said that he didn't like. Like when he talked about kissing Natalie. Paige tells that her son will be going for surgery the next day. They will be starting the skin grafts on him. She thanks Vincent for being such a good friend to her son. \"What were you talking about in here before I came in?\" Jessica is still talking to Nash and telling him that she loves Antonio. Nash says that she had doubts about her wedding and she knows it. \"Jessica!\" Antonio comes out to the two and Jessica asks Nash to leave her with her husband for a minute. \"Are you sorry you married me Jessica?\" Kelly thinks that Zane calling Kevin 'grandpa', and Kelly 'mom' is going to be a little weird. She suggests that Zane call Kevin 'dad'. She assumes that one day they will get married again and it surprises him that she has been thinking about them that way. David makes a pitch at getting Adriana to forgive her mother for her wrongdoings. \"She forgave me and I have done terrible things. She is a good person Adriana. One day you wont' have her anymore. She is your mother. \" Adriana is moved but only for a minute. Rex agrees with Vickers on some levels but mostly he would like to see Adriana stop over-obsessing about getting back at her mother. Adriana gets angry with him wishing that everyone would stop obsessing over telling her to stop obsessing over her mother. Antonio noticed that both Jessica and Nash were late before the wedding and he wonders what that was all about. \"He has issues about me and I have them about him and that is all Antonio! He quickly makes up with her and they kiss. At school Cole manages to make the team with the football game. The coach gives him another talking to about holding it together so they can get the trophy at the end of the season. Cole goes to his locker When Gabe comes to get him, he is very short-tempered. Natalie watches as Antonio and Jessica say goodbye to everyone and leaves. She goes to the yard. Vincent comes out there. She can't believe he is crashing the party so late. \"Natalie. I need to talk to you about something. \""

        "Starr: I don't know that much about football, but I know that you did a really good job tonight, Cole --",
        "Cole: Well --",
        "Starr: Seriously.",
        "Cole: Thanks. I felt pretty good out there.",
        "Britney: Hey, guys.",
        "Starr: What do you want, Britney?",
        "Britney: Oh, I got these for you. Look, I meant what I said before -- no hard feelings about tripping me, right? I know it was just an accident. And I didn't get to congratulate the big hero. So, to the team and to everyone getting just what they deserve.",
        "Cole: You really think you'd get away with this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Why wouldn't I tell Antonio what happened before the wedding?",
        "Nash: Because it's not something he'd want to hear on his wedding night.",
        "Jessica: Well, I think that he'd rather have me tell the truth than lie, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Nobody actually believes that superstition.",
        "Cristian: Todd does. The only reason he caught the garters because you caught the bouquet.",
        "Evangeline: No. It was a total coincidence.",
        "Cristian: There's no such thing with Todd. You saw him gloating and the way he looked at you before he left?",
        "Evangeline: Well, if he did do it on purpose, he just did it to stick it to you. He seems to enjoy that.",
        "Cristian: You know what? He's gone. Let's enjoy that and dance.",
        "Evangeline: Let's. [Evangeline chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I love weddings. Don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You're feeling awfully positive about Clint, aren't you?",
        "Dorian: Let's put it this way -- there's going to be an awful lot more of dancing tonight.",
        "David: Ahem. A waltz at a wedding is one thing. Until you do the horizontal mambo with him again, there aren't going to be any ever-afters, happy or otherwise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Really was a beautiful wedding, wasn't it",
        "Natalie: Yes. Jessica deserved it.",
        "Clint: Natalie, I want you to know that the only reason I don't keep asking if you're ok like other people do is I know you will be. I've always known that.",
        "Natalie: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Clint: Now, have you seen your mother lately?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Did I hear you say that your name is John?",
        "John: I'm -- John.",
        "Vincent: Ji -- Jiminy. Now it makes sense. The color of the eyes, the reason why you're getting pissed at me for kissing Natalie. You're John McBain.",
        "Nurse: It's time for Mr. Hughes' pain meds.",
        "John: No. No. I need -- I need to tell -- I need to tell --",
        "Nurse: Sounds like he was trying to tell us something.",
        "Vincent: Yeah.",
        "Paige: What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Night-night, sweet pea.",
        "Kevin: Good night, cowboy.",
        "Kelly: Hmm.",
        "Kevin: Hmm.",
        "Nurse: Hard to let them go, isn't it?",
        "Kelly: Oh, I just want to hold him all the time.",
        "Nurse: Well, at the rate he's going, you will very soon.",
        "Kelly: Ok. You get some rest. Your mommy and your --",
        "Kevin: What?",
        "Kelly: Oh, I just thought of something. If we're going to be together, then what's Zane going to call you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Oh, I do not want that man coming between us, Cris. Don't let him get to you.",
        "Cristian: What? What did I say?",
        "Evangeline: You're holding me in a death grip.",
        "Cristian: You got to admit, the guy's a jerk.",
        "Evangeline: I admit he's a jerk, but he's my friend -- friend. You're the man I love. You're the man I want to be with.",
        "Cristian: I want us to be together, too. But, you know, I still don't have a job, and even though Vincent's confession cleared me from the boxing commission, there's still the issue of my hand --",
        "Evangeline: Cris, Cris --",
        "Cristian: And I don't --",
        "Evangeline: It's a stupid superstition.",
        "Cristian: What? I'm just --",
        "Evangeline: Look, we don't have to start planning a wedding right now just because the bouquet happened to fall in my hands.",
        "Cristian: Well, you know, Antonio and Jess took their time, and it worked out for them. I don't know, I guess -- I guess just being here did something to me, standing up there with Antonio, watching Jess walk down the aisle, and then looking at you looking all gorgeous and --",
        "Evangeline: Ooh. It did something to me, too. But my career just changed -- I work for the D.A.'s office now. And I'm about to prosecute Spencer Truman. This could be the biggest case of my career.",
        "Cristian: So you're not ready, either?",
        "Evangeline: The only thing I'm ready for right now is this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What -- I know weddings get people to thinking about everything. But you need to focus on getting your business off the ground right now. Marriage isn't all that it's cracked up to be -- take it from somebody who knows.",
        "Adriana: But I thought you loved Jen.",
        "Rex: I did, like crazy, but we did better not married.",
        "Adriana: So not married is better than married?",
        "Rex: No -- I mean, it was for Jen and me, but you and me, we're not Jen and me. You know, you're different, we're -- we're different. It -- it -- it would be different. What's so funny?",
        "Adriana: You. And I love making you sweat.",
        "Rex: There are better ways to get overheated.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You're awfully cynical.",
        "David: Not always cynical. I cry at weddings.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "David: I do. I always cry when I see some rich babe marrying someone else. You know, I had a rich babe of my own once till I lost her.",
        "Dorian: And whose fault is that?",
        "David: You'll always be the one that got away, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: With her bank account intact. Ha!",
        "David: I know -- more's the pity. You know, Natalie's going to run into some of that Buchanan cash. What do you think is the appropriate interval before I can hit on her?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You all right?",
        "Viki: I'm fine.",
        "Clint: You want to say that again like you mean it?",
        "Viki: I'm fine. I'm really fine.",
        "Clint: Why are you so sad?",
        "Viki: I'm not. I'm so relieved. And I'm so happy for Jessie. It's been a long road for her to get to this point with herself and to finally be with somebody that she loves, who loves her back unconditionally. You know, someone who stood by her through -- through her DID, through the baby, through everything. Just between us, despite my assurances to Jessie this morning, there was a part of me that was so afraid that Tess was going to come out today. But thank God she didn't, which means that Jess is, well, truly integrated. I'm so grateful for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: In this case, I think a little lie might be better.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's a crappy way to start a marriage.",
        "Nash: A marriage that almost didn't happen. Jessica, you were having doubts -- admit it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm Zane's grandfather.",
        "Kelly: Don't you think it's going to be a little weird if he calls me \"mother\" and he calls you \"grandpa\"?",
        "Kevin: Uh -- well, I never really thought of it like that, I guess.",
        "Kelly: I -- this is going to be so hard for him to understand.",
        "Kevin: Well, what are you saying? You want him to think that I'm his father instead of Duke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Get away with what? I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Cole: Oh, like hell you don't. I know you're still pissed off at me, Britney.",
        "Britney: For what?",
        "Cole: Not having anything to do with you when you came on to me in the locker room!",
        "Britney: Look, I know you don't want it coming out about us just because it might get you in trouble, but --",
        "Cole: You know, I blew you off and you were mad as hell. Now you're, what, my best friend, giving sodas to me and Starr?",
        "Britney: I was just trying to be nice.",
        "Starr: Ok, ok. Cole, just calm down. We don't want a big scene.",
        "Cole: No, you're right.",
        "Britney: Enjoy the sodas.",
        "Gabe: Wow. She is way too much work, huh?",
        "Cole: Seriously.",
        "Langston: The drama queen's up to something. You better watch your back.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I got it.",
        "Cole: We've got to go get our stuff. We'll be right back.",
        "Starr: And then you're leaving?",
        "Gabe: Well, yeah, but just for a minute. We're going to go to Jim's party tonight.",
        "Langston: Cool.",
        "Cole: Look, you guys can come if you want.",
        "Starr: Uh -- maybe.",
        "Cole: Then wait here for me?",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Langston: You know who Jim is, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah -- big Jim, senior Jim?",
        "Langston: So you're going to the party with Cole?",
        "Starr: It's not like I'm with him.",
        "Langston: He just asked you out.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but he was just letting us know about it.",
        "Langston: Whatever. Are you going or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: Yo, you might want to take those vitamins I gave you out of your locker.",
        "Cole: I don't want them anymore.",
        "Gabe: Oh, come on, man. You played awesome tonight.",
        "Cole: I don't care. I feel like crap on them.",
        "Gabe: Yeah, you -- you were a little sketched out.",
        "Cole: Hey, I told you before, I'm going to finish the season on my own without extra help.",
        "Gabe: Oh, even if we lose?",
        "Cole: Then we do.",
        "Gabe: Well, then you can kiss the college recruiters goodbye.",
        "Cole: Whatever happens, I'm doing it on my own without extra help, all right?",
        "Gabe: Ok. All right. All right. But give them back to me now. I mean, I'm sure I can find someone who will appreciate them. So, why did you turn down Britney? I mean, I can see it before the game, but you were the man tonight. You got to reap the spoils.",
        "Cole: I'm not into her.",
        "Gabe: Well, I'm not saying you got to marry her, but, I mean, there's nothing wrong with a little -- ahem -- no-strings action.",
        "Cole: With Britney, there's always strings. Everyone would have known about it.",
        "Gabe: Like Starr Manning?",
        "Coach: What are you two doing back in here? It's a simple question -- what's up with you two?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: He should rest comfortably till we take him up to surgery.",
        "Paige: Thank you.",
        "Vincent: He's -- he's getting surgery?",
        "Paige: Yeah. They're going to begin the skin grafts on his face. But I wanted to get here now because once they take him in, it could take hours.",
        "Vincent: When's this happening?",
        "Paige: Tomorrow morning. They're prepping him tonight. Weren't you at Jessica Buchanan's wedding? I -- I thought I saw you there.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, I was there. I'm a friend of Natalie's.",
        "Paige: Oh.",
        "Vincent: You know, things have been really hard for her and, you know, her sister getting married --",
        "Paige: Right, after what happened to John. [Paige sighs] Oh, it's -- it's so sad. I just -- I feel so sorry for his family and his friends. You have been such a good friend to my son. And Hugh is going to need that. The process of -- of healing from burns like this can feel absolutely interminable. Thank you, Vincent. Thank you for caring so much.",
        "Vincent: Hey, well, like you said, he was my friend.",
        "Paige: Well, it looks like he still is. What was going on when I came in the room? Did -- did Hugh try to say something to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You two enjoying the wedding?",
        "Rex: As weddings go.",
        "Adriana: I still can't believe my mother showed her face here.",
        "David: I still can't believe that you haven't forgiven her.",
        "Adriana: For almost getting me killed.",
        "David: She does regret that.",
        "Rex: She doesn't regret wanting to break Adriana and I up.",
        "David: And that was bad form.",
        "Adriana: What, did she send you over here as her messenger boy?",
        "David: Bite your tongue. I am no one's messenger boy, unless I'm being appropriately compensated, which I'm currently not.",
        "Adriana: Then why are you telling me this, David? You know how I feel about her.",
        "David: Yes, I do, apparently more than you do. She's your mother, and deep down, you love her as much as she loves you.",
        "Adriana: Which can be fatal. No, thanks.",
        "David: You want to help me out? I'm trying to negotiate a truce here.",
        "Rex: Hmm, good luck with that.",
        "Adriana: Dorian never admitted to me that she was wrong.",
        "David: And she never will. That's not what she does. It doesn't mean that she's not sorry, though. You are breaking her heart.",
        "Adriana: Nice try, but I'm never forgiving her.",
        "David: Adriana, I know that you're mad at her and I do not blame you for being so upset. But you've got to admit as misguided as she was, she only had your best interests at heart.",
        "Rex: What heart?",
        "Adriana: What's best for me is Rex, not Dorian. I don't want anything to have to do with her ever again.",
        "David: I hope you change your mind. If Dorian can forgive me after everything I did to her, she's a good person. And she's your mother. You only get one. I hope you don't pass up the opportunity to get to know her because when she's gone -- and one day, she will be -- that's it. No second chances.",
        "Rex: Not that I'm agreeing with Vickers, but you should at least stop obsessing about her.",
        "Adriana: I would if everyone would stop obsessing about me forgiving her.",
        "Dorian: I'm not even going to bother asking what you were talking to Adriana about. I'm too busy keeping my eye on Viki. She smiles, she laughs, she cries. She fawns all over Clint.",
        "David: You're still going on about that?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "David: They're at their daughter's wedding. Come on. Are they supposed to pretend that the -- the other isn't here?",
        "Dorian: Works for me. Hmm.",
        "David: Dorian -- they're the parents of the bride. It's not like they're going at it in the cloakroom, although I can't quite make out where Clint's left hand is.",
        "Dorian: If you're just going to make smarmy jokes, I'll find somebody else to keep me company.",
        "David: I'm sorry. You know how I get when I'm nervous.",
        "Dorian: And what do you have to be nervous about except where your next meal is coming from? Oh, that's right, I forgot. You don't need to worry -- you're living with me. [Dorian chuckles]",
        "David: That's what makes me nervous.",
        "Dorian: Why? Are you afraid I'll kick you out?",
        "David: No. I'm afraid you won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So you're sure now that these are tears of joy?",
        "Viki: , Absolutely. Oh, Clint, it's a wonderful day for me because it's a wonderful day for Jessica. You know, I know what she had to overcome to get here.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah. You know that better than anyone.",
        "Viki: Yeah, yeah. But, you know, she couldn't have done it without her whole family and everybody who loves her.",
        "Clint: And her own strength and courage, like her mother.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Clint: She learned it from you -- you know that.",
        "Viki: She got a damn good father, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: We're just grabbing our stuff, coach.",
        "Coach: Gabe, you go ahead. I need a minute with Cole.",
        "Gabe: Ok. Yo, I'll see you in the gym?",
        "Cole: What do you want, coach?",
        "Coach: You looked a little slow in the fourth, winded. You're up against some big guys out there, Cole, bigger than you. You got to be fast, which means laps and wind sprints on your own outside of practice.",
        "Cole: Yes, sir.",
        "Coach: But you had a good game tonight. You should be proud.",
        "Cole: Thank you, sir.",
        "Coach: Season isn't over yet, though. Keep focused, no distractions. You're a sophomore on varsity. You're good, but you still got to prove yourself every time you get out there. Don't let up.",
        "Cole: I can't, sir.",
        "Coach: Hmm -- good man. Keep up what you're doing and that trophy's ours. Now, go home, get some rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Uh -- Langston? It's -- it's a little late for a party.",
        "Langston: It's still light in California. And if you don't go to the party with Cole, the Brit bitch is going to be all over him.",
        "Starr: But it's n even like I'm going out with him.",
        "Langston: Maybe you don't think so, but she definitely does and it's driving her crazy. Think of it this way -- if you go to the party with Cole, you'll be saving him from her.",
        "Starr: I think he can handle himself.",
        "Langston: Fine. Then throw Cole to the beotches, and don't worry about Britney. I'm sure she'll admire the fact that you're taking the high road and getting to bed at a decent hour.",
        "Starr: Fine, I'll go to that party because I want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Amber: What was that about Cole blowing you off?",
        "Britney: He just didn't want to do it before the game it's not like he didn't want me.",
        "Girl: So what about tonight, en?",
        "Britney: Tonight, Cole's finally going to get what's coming to him.",
        "Girl: And that would be you?",
        "Britney: Oh, yeah. I'm going to give it to Cole real good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: So, what happened? Were you busted, or what?",
        "Cole: Nah, but, man, if he knew, we --",
        "Gabe: He doesn't know. He doesn't know. Everything's cool.",
        "Cole: Here, take them.",
        "Gabe: No. Look, I'm not taking them to the party tonight. I got a hookup tomorrow. I'll get them from you in the morning.",
        "Cole: Fine. Fine!",
        "Gabe: Dude, chill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Antonio. Antonio, you're the groom. You're alone at your own wedding?",
        "Antonio: No, I'm just catching a breather.",
        "Clint: Ah. Where's Jessica?",
        "Antonio: Ladies' room, I think.",
        "Clint: Oh, yes, yes, yes -- powdering her nose for the umpteenth photograph.",
        "Antonio: Yes.",
        "Clint: You're a married man now.",
        "Antonio: Finally.",
        "Clint: Yeah. I was going to give you some advice, but I'm going to spare you that because if any couple can be happy, it's you and Jessica. Get you anything to eat or anything?",
        "Antonio: Uh -- no, no, thanks. I'm -- I'm good.",
        "Clint: All right. Well, by orders from the mother of the bride, I got to go mingle. See you.",
        "Jessica: Let's get one thing straight, again. I love Antonio and I want to be with him until death, Nash. That's what I promised today.",
        "Nash: Well, you wouldn't know that by the way you've been acting.",
        "Jessica: You didn't want me to marry him.",
        "Nash: Because you have doubts.",
        "Jessica: No. Maybe you do, but I never did.",
        "Nash: Now you're lying to yourself again.",
        "Jessica: Where do you even get this stuff?",
        "Nash: Because you are acting exactly the way Tess did whenever she felt cornered.",
        "Jessica: Really? Well, go to hell.",
        "Antonio: Jess?",
        "Jessica: Out here, Antonio. Hi. Nash and I -- we were just talking.",
        "Antonio: About what?",
