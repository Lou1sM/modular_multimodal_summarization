        "Natalie has been digging all night. It is morning now and she still digs. \"What do you think you are doing?\" She turns to find Vincent standing behind her. He will not let her do this. She feels she has to do it until she finds out if her man is really dead or not. Vincent points out that if John is alive then she is digging up his friend and he just can't allow that. \"You can wait until the surgery is over to find out what you want to know! Kevin and Kelly come to visit the family at Asa's house and they tell that Kevin will be leaving for London that day. The company isn't doing well in London, so Kevin figures that he should get out there sooner. Asa understand him having to go but won't allow anyone to leave that day. Natalie isn't concerned about what she will find when she opens the coffin. She took Forensics and knows what is in there, and what to do with it. Vincent still tries to talk her out of this but she insists. She waves her shovel at him, threatening to hurt him if he doesn't back off. He offers his neck for her to lop off but also reminds her that John wouldn't approve. She isn't so sure of that. She can't wait! Vincent thinks that she is acting crazy. \"You think this is crazy? Just give me one more day of living like this and then you will see how crazy I can be.\" The family fights and fights but at the end it is accepted that Kevin has to make a move to save the branch of the family business in London. Spencer is uncomfortable. His case depends on evidence that is 25 years old which is good but then there is the gun and David's testimony. When alone with David in the courtroom before court starts, David tells how he is leaving town but only after he has put the final nail in Spencer's coffin. He intends to finish this off for John who should be there. Spencer seems afraid of what might happen in court. The really damning thing for him is David's testimony. \"Look, you owe me. Just tell them that you don't remember what happened that night.\" David will not perjure himself for his brother anymore. Spencer offers David enough money to enjoy a rich life five lifetimes more than he could ever imagine. David walks out. Natalie needs to do this but she starts calming down. \"I promise you Natalie, by the end of the day, we will know if John is alive or not!\" He suggests they go to Bo and get him to help them figure this out. She picks up her shovel and they walk off together. Michael and Marcie go to Rex and ask him to find out about Tommy's parents for his medical records. Rex accepts the case. Asa raises a glass. \"To Kevin, Kelly and Little Zane! Godspeed! To the family. God Bless!\""

        "Kevin: Morning, Grandpa, Dad.",
        "Clint: Hey, Kevin. Morning, Kelly.",
        "Asa: I'm surprised that you two aren't at the hospital.",
        "Kevin: Well, we were there most of the night.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, they kicked us out. A new baby came into neonatal, and they had to get everything set up before they let anyone else come back in.",
        "Asa: How's the little fellow doing?",
        "Nigel: Mrs. Davidson has arrived.",
        "Viki: Morning, Clint. Asa -- hi, darling.",
        "Kevin: Mom, I'm glad you could make it.",
        "Viki: Oh, no problem. What's going on? Don't tell me this is about the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: It's about the baby? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Alright, so you're sure she was the secretary? Yeah, I got it. Thanks. I owe you big for this. Mrs. Herman, my name is Rex Balsom. If you could please give me a call -- it's urgent. My number is 555-0192. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You look busy.",
        "Evangeline: I am.",
        "Todd: Is that why you didn't answer your phone last night? Cramming for the Truman trial?",
        "Evangeline: What do you want?",
        "Todd: Is it ok if I sit down?",
        "Evangeline: No, it's not ok. You're the last person I want to deal with today -- or ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Come on, are these handcuffs really necessary at this point?",
        "Guard: Until court's in session, yes, sir.",
        "Spencer: Ridiculous, ridiculous. What do you think I'm going to do, make a run for it? Huh?",
        "Mark: Let it go, Spencer. Let it go. We'll -- we'll get you out of this. Then we'll file complaints.",
        "Spencer: Oh, why the sudden burst of confidence there, mark? Are you finally earning the money that I'm paying you, or just telling me what I want to hear, or you think we actually have a case?",
        "Mark: Well, the state has a weak one. Not only is their evidence 25 years old, it's mostly circumstantial.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, I know. That's what I've been saying all along. I shouldn't even be here right now.",
        "Mark: Look, there's just a couple of trouble areas. One is your possession of the gun. And there's Snyder's testimony, and your brother's. Look, it would help us out a lot if you could convince David not to testify.",
        "David: And miss the greatest day of my life? You murdered Thomas Mc Bain. And I'm going to help them put you away for it.",
        "Spencer: You're really enjoying this, aren't you, David? Why are you enjoying this so much?",
        "David: Uh -- let's see -- oh. Because you made me think that I was a murderer for 25 years.",
        "Spencer: Oh, yes. Right, that. Well, so, now this is how you plan to exact your revenge on your big brother? Is that it?",
        "David: No, no, this isn't just for me. You're going to go down for murdering John Mc Bain's father. And when you do, maybe John will be able to rest in peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Man, I know that you're still pissed at me for not telling you when I knew that Vincent was setting Cristian up, but --",
        "Evangeline: And for betting against him.",
        "Todd: But I admitted it, that it was not a good thing to do. It was not ok.",
        "Evangeline: It's more than that, ok? I could have you arrested for withholding evidence and impeding a police investigation.",
        "Todd: You wouldn't do that to little old me, would you? Ok. Where's Cristian? I'm surprised he'd let you out alone.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, yeah. That's great, Todd. That's a sure way to get me to forgive you.",
        "Todd: So you admit that you could forgive me? Ok, so I'll just stop talking. You're right, it -- this stuff's more important than me.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, and that's why Cristian isn't here. Because he gets that I need some time alone before this trial starts.",
        "Todd: Is he coming to the trial?",
        "Evangeline: Mm-hmm, yeah. He's going to be there to support me.",
        "Todd: So will I, and I'm going to be the first person to stand up and cheer when Truman's convicted of murder one.",
        "Evangeline: No. I don't want you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: I'm not going to be convicted of anything, little brother.",
        "David: Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that. Your teflon coating's gone through the dishwasher a few too many times, Spencer. You're starting to flake.",
        "Spencer: You know, I keep hearing that -- from you, Bo Buchanan, Michael Mc Bain, the prosecution. The thing is none of you would be rattling on like you are if you actually had me dead to rights.",
        "David: Actually, we just enjoy watching you squirm. You've done it to us for so long, it's nice to watch you be tortured a little bit.",
        "Spencer: I'm far from squirming, David.",
        "David: I think you'll rethink that when I get up there on the witness stand and give my version of my big brother, the psychopathic murderer.",
        "Spencer: And my attorney will expose you for being a liar, a con artist, and a freeloader.",
        "David: Pfff. That's old new everybody knows that. You're the new \"it\" boy.",
        "Spencer: Think about it, David. Your reputation is pretty bad around here.",
        "David: I know. And I have thought about it. I'm hoping that llanview considers this a farewell gift.",
        "Spencer: Well, I'm not going anywhere, David.",
        "David: No, you idiot. I'm the one who's leaving. I'm going to Tikrit -- or Tangiers, or Topeka. The point is you'll never know. I'm only staying long enough to put the final nail in your coffin.",
        "Spencer: You're leaving Llanview?",
        "David: It was nice until you showed up. Now I can't wait to get out from under your stink and start over.",
        "Spencer: You'll be back.",
        "David: Possibly. But you know, now that I think about it, I've got my whole life ahead of me, don't I? I can do whatever I want now. Now that I'm out from under you, wherever I want to go, whatever I want to do. But don't you worry. I'll do the living for both of us.",
        "Spencer: Well, I wish you well, then.",
        "David: Since when? You finally met your match in John Mc Bain, didn't you? I'm just glad I lived to see the day.",
        "Spencer: Too bad he didn't.",
        "David: Yeah, Spencer, it is too bad. And that's why I'm not leaving town until I testify against you. To make sure that John's revenge sticks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rex: Who's there?",
        "Michael: It's Michael and Marcie.",
        "Rex: That kid keeps getting cuter and cuter.",
        "Marcie: Thank you. You see that? Hmm.",
        "Rex: Takes after his Godfather. Right, dawg? So, what's up with you guys?",
        "Marcie: We would like to talk to you about something.",
        "Rex: Uh -- well, is later ok? I'm kind of working on a case right now.",
        "Michael: Well, it's actually business we'd like to talk to you about. We want to hire you.",
        "Rex: To do what?",
        "Marcie: We want you to find Tommy's parents.",
        "Michael: She wants you to find Tommy's parents.",
        "Marcie: Do you think you could do that?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I'll try. Who knows? Maybe I'll corner the market on putting families back together.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Like Hugh and Paige, huh?",
        "Rex: Actually, I'm trying to find another guy's son right now. Feels pretty good. Only a matter of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm here to find out whether you're full of crap or not.",
        "Vincent: By digging up a dead body?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, if John isn't in there, a simple D.N.A. test will prove it.",
        "Vincent: And you think digging up a corpse is simple, Natalie?",
        "Natalie: Well, seeing as how John, or Hugh, or whoever it is, is in surgery right now, and nobody wants to listen to me, this is all I have got.",
        "Vincent: And you can't wait until they get him out of surgery?",
        "Natalie: No, I cannot wait to get him out of surgery. If you're right, the man I love is alive.",
        "Vincent: And if I'm right, my friend, Paige's son, might be dead in John's grave. I'm sorry, Natalie, but I'm not going to let you dig him up.",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you stop me.",
        "Vincent: You know, I know you need proof. And I want you to get it. I really do. And I need to know, too, and so does Bo Buchanan. And dr. Miller, and Michael Mc Bain. But digging up a grave -- desecrating a grave won't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Zane's fine.",
        "Kevin: Actually, he's improving faster than the doctors expected, so it's good.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, thank goodness for that.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, you had us worried there for a minute.",
        "Kevin: Oh, sorry. I mean, if something was wrong, we would have told you right off.",
        "Asa: Nigel?",
        "Nigel: Yes, sir?",
        "Asa: Rustle up some more breakfast. I think we're about to have a little family powwow.",
        "Nigel: Right away, sir.",
        "Asa: Kelly --",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm?",
        "Asa: Any new pictures of the little guy?",
        "Kelly: Oh, funny you should ask. I have a few right here.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Kelly: I took those pictures of Zane this morning before we left the hospital.",
        "Asa: Oh, yeah. Looks like grandpa.",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Asa: I -- I like the name Zane. Zane Grey. The best western writer, ever.",
        "Kevin: Well, if you don't count Louis L'Amour.",
        "Asa: Oh-ho-ho. I wonder where he got that from.",
        "Clint: Yeah, yeah, I used to read Louis L'Amour to the boys at bedtime.",
        "Kevin: That's right. Yeah, Duke liked him, too. You know, I never knew that until after he was gone. Found a whole collection of them on his bookshelves.",
        "Asa: Duke made me read every one of them. Kept me up late. We'd argue who was the best western writer.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Who won?",
        "Asa: Eh, we agreed not to agree. But I know one thing. I think he'd be very happy with a son named Zane.",
        "Clint: You know, if this is not about Zane Buchanan, what is it about?",
        "Kevin: Moving to London.",
        "Viki: You know, darling -- I mean, I still think it's a good idea, but I'm going to miss you two so much.",
        "Asa: I second that. But Buchanan enterprise's London division hasn't been the same since you left, Clint.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I know that, but if anybody can get it back on track, Pa, it's Kevin. But we knew you were going to London. You didn't get us together to tell us that.",
        "Kevin: You're right, I didn't. What I came to say is that I'm leaving today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: So, when did you start caring more about John Mc Bain than your own brother, David?",
        "David: How do you even say that with a straight face?",
        "Spencer: Would you mind if I spoke to my brother, David, alone, just for a moment?",
        "Mark: All right.",
        "David: What is this? You think I snuck bolt cutters in my shorts? Have a little faith in the metal detectors.",
        "Spencer: Cut the crap, David. Enough already. Are you planning on testifying against me or not?",
        "David: I don't have a choice. I was subpoenaed.",
        "Spencer: I know that, but you could just have a little lapse in memory, don't you think? I mean, you could. You do owe me, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You don't want me at Spencer Truman's trial? Huh, after what that bastard did to me, there's no way I'm staying away from it.",
        "Evangeline: This case doesn't have anything to do with you. This is about Thomas Mc Bain's murder.",
        "Todd: Evangeline, it's open to the public, and to the press, of which I am a member.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, yeah. Yeah, and the arties you wrote almost caused a change of venue.",
        "Todd: Oh, way to go, getting the judge to change his mind about that. I knew you could.",
        "Evangeline: If you're there, you will steal focus from this case. And the people on the jury are going to be thinking about Margaret, and they're going to be thinking about the execution.",
        "Todd: And that's a problem because --",
        "Evangeline: Because it'll muddy the waters. Todd, my job is hard enough as it is. Don't make it worse. Butt out. I mean it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're smelling a little ripe there, bud.",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, he's -- it's just gas.",
        "Rex: Well, I'm not in the \"Godfather needs to know\" category.",
        "Marcie: You just wait. Just wait until you have your own kids. You'll find it fascinating.",
        "Rex: So, how much do you guys know about Tommy's birth parents?",
        "Marcie: Uh --",
        "Michael: Not a whole lot. I mean, you already know who his first adoptive parents were. Joanne and Frederick Scott.",
        "Rex: The couple that died in the tornado, right?",
        "Michael: The very same. And child services got us a copy of the little guy's birt certificate --",
        "Marcie: Oh --",
        "Michael: But there are no names.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Actually I have it --",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Marcie: Right here. I know it's in here. Here it is.",
        "Rex: \"Mother and father unknown.\"",
        "Michael: Yeah, everything the Scotts had was destroyed in the tornado.",
        "Rex: Well, it's not like they got Tommy black market.",
        "Michael: We know that.",
        "Rex: So why do you even care where he came from?",
        "Marcie: Well, I would like to get my hands on his health records. You know, just in case anything ever happens, then at least I know his medical history.",
        "Michael: So do you think you can find the kid's parents or not?",
        "Rex: Sure. I can do that. It's cake.",
        "Michael: It's cake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I just want to help, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: The way you helped Cristian?",
        "Todd: I said I'm sorry for that I don't know how many times now. And I have admitted it.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. You admitted it after Cristian already found out the truth about it.",
        "Todd: But I didn't know about that. I was trying to show you that I could be a good little boy. That I -- that I can confess to something naughty.",
        "Evangeline: Uh-huh. You know, maybe if you hadn't bet against him -- that's what hurts the most, Todd. Not only did you not tell me, but you made a game out of it by putting your own money down.",
        "Todd: It wasn't about the money.",
        "Evangeline: No, it's not about the money, it's about you. It's always about you, isn't it?",
        "Todd: Except when it comes to you.",
        "Evangeline: Prove it. Do what I ask.",
        "Todd: I just don't see why my staying away would make a difference.",
        "Evangeline: Because I can't do my job with you there. Because I'm going to be standing there worried about you going off on something that's going to cause a mistrial.",
        "Todd: I wouldn't do that to you.",
        "Evangeline: You do that every single time we're in court together.",
        "Todd: Not this time.",
        "Evangeline: Every time --",
        "Todd: I promise --",
        "Evangeline: Todd, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't trust you anymore.",
        "Todd: You really think I would do something to hurt your case?",
        "Evangeline: If you really want to see Spencer pay for what he's done, then you will do us all a favor and stay the hell away. If I see you at that court, I'm going to ask the judge to have you removed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You expect me to perjure myself? To risk going to jail for you?",
        "Spencer: All right, all right, all right. Would you keep it down? People are listening. Come on, man.",
        "David: Wow. You're scared, aren't you? Beneath all the bravado and threats, you're afraid for your life.",
        "Spencer: I'm not worried in the least, David. There's no way they can put me in that alleyway at the particular time of the shooting, and they have no way of proving motive or opportunity.",
        "David: But I can. I was in that alley when you were there. Remember? You were there to \"protect\" me.",
        "Spencer: Well, assuming that what you're saying is right -- I'm not saying that it is -- is testifying against me any way to repay me for that?",
        "David: If you had shot Thomas Mc Bain in a panic, maybe I could have understood that. But to go to the hospital and mess with his stitches -- that's just plain cold-blooded.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Let's just wait until they get him out of surgery. The doctors can run a D.N.A., get the body exhumed --",
        "Natalie: We have to get a court order for that.",
        "Vincent: Your uncle's the Commissioner.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, of L.P.D. This is way out of his jurisdiction.",
        "Vincent: So? He can get somebody.",
        "Natalie: Do you know how long that could possibly take?",
        "Vincent: You can get him to grease it.",
        "Natalie: He's not even listening to me right now!",
        "Natalie: \"Patience\"? Patience -- you want me to have patience? You tell me that the love of my life is alive, and you want me to what, do nothing to prove it? I'm sorry, this is the only thing I know how to do right now. Ok? So you have two choices. You can help me, or you can get the hell out of my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You really think that you can do this, Rex? I mean, you're not just yanking my chain? You're not just telling me that you can do it, when you really can't?",
        "Rex: It's just a matter of legwork. I check out hospitals, clinics the day he was born.",
        "Michael: You saw the birth certificate. There are no names.",
        "Rex: Well, yeah, but you know how it goes. Birth records and admittance records are different animals. Then there's insurance files, billing forms --",
        "Michael: Which are all confidential and sealed.",
        "Rex: I'm a P.I. We can get stuff cops can't.",
        "Michael: Ok, Mr. Gumshoe.",
        "Marcie: Wait -- wait, wait, wait a minute here. You are not going to do anything crazy, right? I mean, you're not going to, like, physically harm anybody in any way, shape, or form? What?",
        "Rex: That only happens in the crime stories you write. The real deal is a lot more boring.",
        "Marcie: Fine. As long as you do not hurt anyone, I'm ok with it.",
        "Rex: Nobody's going to get hurt. But we are going into a gray area here. Once I get the names, getting the parents' medical records -- it isn't exactly legal.",
        "Michael: Really? You didn't say anything about breaking any laws, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Oh, I really don't see what the big deal is.",
        "Michael: With breaking laws?",
        "Marcie: We need the records. Michael, please.",
        "Michael: Ok. Ok, fine. We need the records.",
        "Rex: Let me see the birth certificate again.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Michael: Hey, do you want me to get that?",
        "Rex: Sure, thanks. [Rex sighs] So, you still want me to take your case?",
        "Todd: Forget it. You're working full-time for me.",
        "Rex: Maybe not much longer. That lead I told you about panned out. Could take us right to your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're moving to London today?",
        "Asa: Nothing is going to happen today.",
        "Clint: Kevin, I thought you were going to leave in a few weeks.",
        "Kevin: Well, I got another call this morning. Whatever's going on there isn't getting better by me staying here.",
        "Viki: But, but -- that's ridiculous. I mean, the -- the baby's not strong enough to travel yet.",
        "Kelly: Well, Zane and I are going to stay here for a while to be with his doctors.",
        "Viki: But, honey, you can't handle that alone.",
        "Kevin: Mom, she's not going to be alone. She's got her family and all of you to help her.",
        "Kelly: And this way, Kevin will go, he'll get us an apartment, and everything will be set up when we get there.",
        "Asa: So, are you two back together? Or is this because of Duke's baby?",

        "Kelly: We can't do that in Llanview. We have to go someplace else. It wouldn't be fair to Zane.",
        "Asa: So you think going someplace else will solve everything?",
        "Kevin: I think it's a good start, yes.",
        "Asa: I understand it, then. But you understand this. There is no way in hell anybody's going to leave today.",

        "Spencer: Regardless of what you think about me, David, if had wanted Thomas Mc Bain dead, I would have found a much more humane way of euthanizing him. That being said, whatever actually took place that night, I was only doing it to protect you. You've got to believe that.",
        "David: You know, the sickest part about this whole thing is you actually believe that. Hustling me out of the country to protect me from a murder charge. The fact that you committed the murder -- well, that's just beyond you. And then you cover for Paige, you let someone else take the fall for it, while you were the butcher. None of this somehow fits into your moral computer. The voices in your head just keep cheering you on as the hero.",
        "Spencer: All right, let's try this again. Let's try to communicate in a language that you can really understand. Money, for instance. My attorney will have more money waiting for you than you can ever possibly spend in five lifetimes. Do you understand?",
        "Mark: Sorry to interrupt, but I need to talk to Spencer.",

        "Vincent: Do you know how crazy this looks? Did you even think about what you'll find if you open up a coffin?",
        "Natalie: I studied forensics. I know exactly what I'm going to find, and I know what to do with it. Now, move.",
        "Vincent: I don't think so.",
        "Natalie: Damn it, Vincent. How did you even find me anyway?",
        "Vincent: Well, after you ran out on me in the hospital, I looked all over for you. I tried to track you down. Then I thought about it. You ran out right after I told you that John was in the operating room, and Hugh might be buried in John's grave. Now, I didn't think you would come here, Natalie. But then I thought about how desperate you are, and --",
        "Natalie: So, what, do you want a pat on the back for finding me?",
        "Vincent: Maybe I should be a detective.",
        "Natalie: You know, John -- he may have found this out a lot quicker. But he'd also agree that I need to find the fastest way to the truth. And right now, this is it. So back off, or you're not going to know what hit you.",

        "Kevin: Listen to me, ok? Seeing Zane fight for every day, for every breath has made me realize what's important. Ok? And revenge is not on the radar for me anymore. I mean, that's part of moving to London -- to put this all behind us.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart -- I an, can't you -- can't you stay at least -- I don't know -- thanksgiving, please?",
        "Kevin: Not if I want to turn B.E.'s fourth quarter around. I can't.",
        "Clint: Yeah -- you'll be coming back for the holidays, though, right?",
        "Kevin: If I can. I mean, dad, you of all people know what it's like. You know, look, I'm not leaving forever.",
        "Kelly: And Zane and I will be here for a while.",
        "Asa: But I'll tell you something. You're not going to be away for good. And you both are taking my great-great-grandson with you. And I'm going to tell you both, that's going to break Renee's heart.",
        "Kevin: Oh, grandpa, listen. We're going to come and visit, ok? I promise you -- when we can. And -- and listen, Renee -- she can come to London anytime she wants -- and you, too, if you can.",

        "Kevin: I realize that, Grandpa.",
        "Asa: I'm going to tell you something. While I'm here, I'm going to enjoy my family. That's the only thing that's important.",
        "Kevin: It's important to me, too. That's part of the reason I'm going -- for your legacy. And I don't want to see what you worked a lifetime for just fall apart now. You know? And it's not just business. I want to make a life for my family, and I can't do that here. Not the way things are.",
        "Clint: All right. I guess it's settled, then.",
        "Kevin: I guess so. I guess the only thing left to do is say goodbye.",

Just in case something happens to him. Then we have his medical history. I'm sure as a father that you can understand that.",
        "Todd: Yeah, Starr was sick when she was little. Your baby's funny.",
        "Marcie: Excuse me? My baby is not funny, he's -- he is very smart. I mean, developmentally, he's months ahead of where he should be. He's already rolling over and holding his bottle and everything.",

        "Evangeline: I just wish John were here. I mean, he made this case. His testimony and his passion for finding his father's killer would sway a jury of statues.",

My God, if -- if he's alive, my life -- it's -- it's one way. And if he's not, and I get my hopes up, and then we find out, then my life -- it's just this black hole.
