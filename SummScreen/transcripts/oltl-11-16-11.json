        "Blair: [Laughs]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Can I ask you a personal question?",
        "Blair: Shoot.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Were you ever a gymnast? Drill instructor?",
        "Blair: Every single day.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Stunt woman? Alligator wrestler?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Then I really am impressed. [Groans] [Laughs] Oh, yeah. Any regrets?",
        "Blair: Do you mean do I wish that I was someplace else with someone else? Not on your life. She made me realize what I want. And I want you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: Miss me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: Oh, excuse me. Chief, my family's exhausted. Can we go home now, please? [Sighs] We just started investigating. But do we have to be here for that?",
        "Fire Chief: Well, we need help narrowing down the suspects.",
        "Rama: Suspects?",
        "Fire Chief: This fire was no accident, Mr. Patel. Someone set it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi? Gigi! It's you. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Gigi! Please!",
        "Ticket Agent: Hey, what the hell are you doing?!",
        "Rex: Gigi! Don't go! Gigi! [Muffled] Come back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: He's probably sleeping through the night, but I don't care. I'm so waking him up for this 'cause it -- oh, my God. Nigel!",
        "John: He's still got a pulse. Go check on Liam!",
        "Natalie: Huh? John! John, Liam's gone! [Breathing heavily]",
        "John: Okay, call it in. Call the station.",
        "Natalie: Wait, what do I tell them?",
        "John: Tell them we've got a possible kidnapping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What do you think, son? Where do you want to start our big adventure? We can go anywhere, as long as it's far away and nobody knows our names.",

        "Vimal: Are you saying that somebody deliberately tried to burn down The Sun?",
        "Rama: Unbelievable. [Sighs]",
        "Fire Chief: I assure you ma'am, it's not.",
        "Rama: But why would anyone want to do such a thing?",
        "Fire Chief: I can't tell you why. I can only say how. We've got a signature char pattern, hydrocarbon vapor, and the sprinkler system was disabled. This was a deliberate act.",
        "Vimal: But who?",
        "Fire Chief: I think Jack can answer that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: Lovely place for a reunion.",
        "Todd: I'm glad you like it. I thought you might. I figured with the stench of the still water and the smell of the gun oil, it would be just like we never said goodbye.",
        "Baker: I see you forgot your bulletproof vest this time.",
        "Todd: I'm not gonna need it.",

        "Tom\u00e1s: Okay, okay. I am convinced.",

        "Tom\u00e1s: And Todd is?",
        "Blair: Todd is the father of my children. End...of...story. So, whatever he's brooding about, whatever dark secrets that he is nursing, I really don't want to know about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're not gonna shoot me, Baker. Okay, maybe you are gonna shoot me. But if you do, you won't get your half of the deal.",

        "Blair: Hey, hey, hey. You'd better not kiss and tell.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: [Sighs] Monsieur Calmar. No, I was...busy. Actually, I thought I'd turned the phone off. Yes, I was able to get into Todd's office, but there were complications. Blair came in, and then Todd. Hell, yes, I'm going back. That's the best way to prove that Todd killed Victor.",

        "John: Nigel, can you hear me?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. We just came home, and the baby was gone. Because he was gone, and the guy that was watching him has been knocked out. Could you just please, somebody -- send somebody here!",
        "John: Come on. Hey, he's waking up. Nigel!",

        "Ticket Agent: Sir!! Step back!",

        "Ticket Agent: It's sold out.",
        "Rex: No, it can't be! I got to get on this plane.",
        "Ticket Agent: We will find you another flight.",
        "Rex: No, no, no. It has to be this plane, okay? Gigi's on this one.",
        "Ticket Agent: Sir, if you don't calm down, I'm calling Security!",

        "Ticket Agent: Okay, you'll take Flight 83 out of here tonight, arriving at LAX, where you'll change planes to Flight 9556 direct to Sydney.",
        "Brody: I don't really want to change planes.",
        "Ticket Agent: There are no direct flights, but it's a very brief layover.",
        "Liam: [Grunts]",
        "Ticket Agent: And with the time difference, you'll be leaving for Sydney before midnight.",
        "Brody: Yeah, okay. [Straining] All right. Come here, son.",
        "Ticket Agent: You have a balance of $1,280.",

        "Ticket Agent: Hey. Where do you think you're going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Brody did this to you?!",
        "John: All right. Take it easy, Nigel, all right? We need to remember. We need every detail. Have a seat.",
        "Nigel: [Breathing heavily] I, uh, heard a noise in the nursery. I thought perhaps you had returned, but there was Officer Lovett, holding Liam, about to depart.",
        "Natalie: Brody took Liam.",
        "Nigel: He said you wanted the baby at the ceremony. I-I thought it was odd that you hadn't called and asked me to bring him 'round.",
        "John: All right. Listen to me. What did Brody say?",
        "Nigel: I offered to help, and he declined... sharply. He wouldn't allow me to take the baby... or the, uh, travel...bag. Now, then I knew that s-- uh... [Sighs] I failed.",
        "John: No, you're doing great, man. All right, what next?",
        "Nigel: I took out my phone... to call Miss Natalie. Officer Lovett was coming toward me. That's the last thing I remember.",
        "John: All right, you okay? Hey, look at me. Everything's gonna be all right, all right? Now, look around. See if Brody took anything, okay? All right. Nigel, listen to me. You've got to think, man. All right? Did Brody say anything or did he do anything that might indicate where he's going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vreeland: Officer Lovett.",
        "Brody: [Chuckles]",
        "Vreeland: Got you, man. Hey, isn't this supposed to be your wedding night?",
        "Brody: Excuse us. Vreeland! [Chuckles] What, you don't get enough time in uniform?",
        "Vreeland: Eh, the TSA is understaffed, and they pay L.P.D. officers time and a half, so I'm picking up shifts. Hey, where's Natalie?",
        "Brody: Ladies' room.",
        "Vreeland: I thought she said that you were going to Greece.",
        "Dispatcher: Assistance requested at Gate 3, Code 87. Immediate assistance at Gate 3, Code 87.",
        "Vreeland: Copy that. Lovett, give me a hand.",
        "Brody: What?",
        "Vreeland: There's a dangerous passenger. There's nobody else on shift.",
        "Brody: No, I can't. I got a flight.",
        "Vreeland: Nobody's flying until this gets situated.",
        "Brody: No, I got my son.",
        "Ticket Agent: I can watch him.",

        "Flight attendant: Here are your drinks.",
        "Cutter: Gracias. [Quietly] It couldn't have been Rex.",
        "Stacy: Uh, trust me. It was.",
        "Cutter: No, he left.",
        "Stacy: Well, he must have come back.",
        "Cutter: Are you sure he saw you?",
        "Stacy: The whole airport is sure.",
        "Cutter: [Sighs] All right, what did he do?",
        "Stacy: [Sighs] I guess he saw me boarding the plane. He called out \"Gigi,\" and the idiot I am, I turned around. He looked right at me and went crazy.",
        "Cutter: What do you mean, \"crazy\"?",
        "Stacy: Well, they shut the door, and he started pounding on it and yelling at them to open it up.",
        "Cutter: Beautiful. All right, we'll just sit here. If anyone says anything, just, you don't know him. You have no idea what's going on.",
        "Stacy: Oh, God. That poor guy. He thinks Gigi is on this plane. What did I just do to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi! I'm coming! Open the door! Could you please hurry?! I will break the door down if you don't -- I got to get on the plane, okay?! Let me on the plane! What?! God, Brody?",
        "Brody: Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How should I know who started the fire?",
        "Fire Chief: You're Todd Manning's son. You must know your father has enemies.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Fire Chief: Maybe you can think of someone who's made threats, someone who might torch the office for revenge -- a disgruntled employee, somebody who's been fired?",
        "Jack: I don't know! You'll have to ask him!",
        "Fire Chief: I've tried calling Mr. Manning all night. He's not picking up.",
        "Vimal: Well, then Mr. Manning must be involved in something very sensitive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It's up to you, Baker, but do me a favor. Either shoot me or put the gun away so we can talk.",
        "Baker: Sorry, it's just routine. I didn't know what you had in mind.",
        "Todd: Well, the truth is, there's a very small part of me that did think about gutting you like a fish and throwing you into the river.",
        "Baker: I was just doing my job.",
        "Todd: You're very good at it.",
        "Baker: Thank you.",
        "Todd: That's why you're still alive.",
        "Baker: I don't come cheap.",
        "Todd: Oh, you haven't heard. I'm rich again. I got it all back -- everything. And by everything, I mean everything that was rightfully mine.",
        "Baker: Congratulations. You're a man of means.",
        "Todd: Yes. And now I'm gonna make it work for me.",
        "Baker: You'd better hurry... because I hear Tom\u00e1s Delgado is trying to take it all away from you... again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yes, I still have the same lead -- Todd's friend Louie, the homeless vet. Maybe he's helping Todd cover his tracks. If I can hunt him down and ask him questions... then maybe I can finally prove that Todd killed Victor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If you want, I can go find Scar-- my dad and get him here.",
        "Fire Chief: That's okay, son. We'll find him. Think you've done your share for tonight.",
        "Rama: Yes, thank you, Jack. You are our hero.",
        "Jack: No. No, I'm not.",
        "Rama: Yes, you are. You're the kind of boy any family would be proud of, huh? The way you broke down that door and extinguished that fire.",
        "Jack: Really, it was nothing.",
        "Fire Chief: I don't think so. If you and Miss Patel hadn't come along in time, these two might not be here. What brought you by?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Fire Chief: Why'd you happen to be in the building?",
        "Jack: You know Scarface, the guy who killed my dad? He's using the newspaper he stole from him to pin the murder on someone else.",
        "Neela: That's terrible.",
        "Jack: Tell me about it. Look... this used to my dad's face. And now look. It's Scarface. He's trying to make it like my dad never existed.",
        "Neela: He must be an evil man.",
        "Jack: Totally. But he's not gonna get away with it.",
        "Neela: Jack brought me here to find my brother. He knew Vimal holds my life in his hands.",
        "Vimal: Neela.",
        "Fire Chief: He does?",
        "Neela: The same way Jack held your life in his hands... and saved it. I had to know what you'd do with mine, Vimal.",
        "Fire Chief: Look like you folks could do with some family time. Mr. Patel, if I could have a minute alone with you and your wife, I think we can let you go. Kids, could you wait out in the hall?",
        "Jack: Why did you tell them we came here to see Vimal?",
        "Neela: What else could I say? That you're the one who set the fire?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fire Chief: Didn't want to ask you this in front of the kids.",
        "Rama: But we have nothing to hide.",
        "Fire Chief: Mr. Patel, we've examined the doors to this office. They were rigged to trap you inside.",
        "Vimal: What? Wh-- what are you saying?",
        "Fire Chief: Possibly that... the target of the fire wasn't Todd Manning or the son.",
        "Rama: You think...someone wanted to hurt us?",
        "Fire Chief: Can you think of anyone who'd want to do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vreeland: Sir, step back. Put your hands up.",
        "Brody: Whoa, it's okay. It's okay. What are you doing here?",
        "Vreeland: Sir --",
        "Brody: I got this, Vreeland. I know this guy. Come here.",
        "Rex: You looking for Natalie?",
        "Brody: Natalie was here?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Brody: John was leaving town tonight.",
        "Rex: Look, Brody, for what it's worth, I'm sorry --",
        "Brody: Rex, what were you doing that they had to call Security?",
        "Rex: I had to stop the plane.",
        "Brody: Well, you did that! Nobody's taking off right now.",
        "Rex: Good, open the door!",
        "Brody: What?!",
        "Rex: I got to get on the plane!",
        "Brody: Why?!",
        "Rex: Because Gigi's on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: [Sighs]",
        "Cutter: That's impressive.",
        "Stacy: [Sighs] I just want this over. Why aren't we taking off?",
        "Cutter: We will. You're safe. You're on the plane. It's gonna take off. It's a long flight, so maybe just, you know, pace yourself.",
        "Stacy: You afraid I'm gonna drink the plane dry? I don't even know. Is Stacy Morasco a big drinker?",
        "Cutter: I don't know either. I mean, you were a stripper, so you can probably knock 'em back.",
        "Stacy: God, you know more about me than I do. You know way more about me than I know about you.",
        "Cutter: Nothing to know.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, right. Come on. We've spent the last few weeks together. You know my whole life. I only know your name.",
        "Cutter: Like I said -- nothing to know.",
        "Stacy: [Sighs] Please? Just, uh, tell me something. Anything. I need to hear something to get my mind off of that image of Rex standing there at the airport. Tell me a story.",
        "Cutter: Once upon a time, there was a princess -- [Chuckles]",
        "Stacy: No! Ehh! No fairytales. You know all my dirty secrets, so tell me one of yours. Come on. Pony up.",
        "Cutter: [Exhales sharply]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Rex, Gigi is not on that plane. She's not on any plane.",
        "Rex: Look, B-Brody, you don't have to get it, okay? Just open the door! I'll prove it. Just open the door!",
        "Brody: The flight is locked out. It's an FAA thing.",
        "Rex: Fine, then tell them it's an emergency! Damn it! You -- you owe me, okay? You shot me! You stole my --",
        "Brody: Rex!",
        "Rex: Okay, you're a good guy. I know you are, all right? Please. You have to help me get my fianc\u00e9e back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, so I checked. Brody, uh, only took the duffel bag. It only had a few days' worth of clothes in it.",
        "John: Okay, so, he said he was going to the church. That's all?",
        "Nigel: T-that's all. When I tried to take little Liam, he said, \"He's my son,\" as if I didn't know.",
        "Natalie: No, no. Liam is not Brody's son.",
        "John: He's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No comment. Goodbye. Just so you know, I did not kiss and tell.",
        "Blair: Who was it?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Calmar.",
        "Blair: He is such a busybody! He's gonna want to know every little detail. You'd better not.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Or what? I'll see the drill instructor again?",
        "Blair: That's right.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Mm.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. What did he want?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I asked him for help with the investigation.",
        "Blair: Victor's murder? What did he have to say about that?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Oh, he just had more questions than answers. What'd you bring?",
        "Blair: Just a bunch of goodies.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Mmm, perfect.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Maybe we can finally have that dinner we planned.",
        "Blair: Oh, really, where we discuss those possible suspects?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Hopefully we can cover a few other topics.",
        "Blair: Why? Do you have a new suspect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Baker: He's asking questions. I've spoken with some former colleagues. He seems to be asking about you and Victor. You know, the night Victor died? Of course. You knew that already. So I suppose that's what I'm here for.",
        "Todd: How's a guy like you handle retirement? I mean, what do you do? You play shuffleboard? You squeeze in a few rounds of golf?",
        "Baker: I keep busy.",
        "Todd: You know, I bet that you would do twice the job that Irene did running that little organization if you had her funds. And I now have those funds.",
        "Baker: So... what would you have me do? It's your party, Manning. What do you want? In exchange for the money.",

        "Todd: Absolutely. Oh, and the investigation. Tom\u00e1s is, for some reason, convinced... that I killed Victor... [Sighs] ...With this.",
        "Baker: If you didn't, turn the gun in. Let the police test it.",
        "Todd: That's not an option.",

        "[Briefcase snaps]",

        "Tom\u00e1s: [Chuckling] It's a pretty good reason.",

        "Fire Chief: Ma'am, someone came in here, disabled the sprinklers and alarms, locked you in this office, and started a fire. Looks like someone wanted you out of the way.",
        "Rama: No, we are law-abiding citizens. We keep to ourselves. We lead tidy lives. There's no one who would harm us or --",

        "Rex: Well, they took off. The plane left. You let her get away.",
        "Brody: I don't have time for this. Rex, you got to keep it together. I can't bail you out again. You're on your own. [Sighs] Good luck.",

        "Stacy: What's wrong with people?",
        "Cutter: People are unreliable.",
        "Stacy: Well, there had to be someone reliable in your life. You must have had parents.",
        "Cutter: Oh, yeah. Billy Joe Wentworth. Born dirt poor. Puts himself through school working three jobs. Becomes a trader. Makes a killing on the market, and then he trades himself up -- becomes William J. Wentworth, Jr.",
        "Stacy: Well, see? Good for him.",
        "Cutter: Yeah, yep. So, his redefined self and his new stock portfolio gets him the prettiest girl in the state. So Billy Joe marries Alexandra, and they have themselves two little kids -- me and my sister. Had a big mansion, ranch in Montana, house in the Gulf for the summers.",
        "Stacy: Mm. Sounds like the perfect life.",
        "Cutter: Except Alexandra -- she doesn't want to be the perfect wife and mom. So, she cleans him out, takes off. Except Daddy doesn't take too kindly to rejection.",
        "Stacy: What happened?",
        "Cutter: He spent every last dime trying to track her down... except she didn't want to be found, so... he quit. Quit his job. Quit his friends. Quit on me and my sister. And eventually... he stops getting out of bed, decides to quit breathing.",
        "Stacy: I'm sorry.",

        "Jack: Fine! You win! I did it! I set the fire!",
        "Neela: Why?",

        "Jack: I didn't want them to get hurt. I sent everyone home!",

        "Jack: I don't know! All right? But once you told me they were here, I came as quick as I could. I couldn't let anyone get hurt. Not after last time.",

I've been trying to keep it together for our son, and I usually do, but... the woman on that plane, she looked like my fianc\u00e9e. So, when I saw her, I lost it.",

        "Cutter: 3rd grade, maybe? It didn't seem to matter much after that. Me and my sister went to foster care.",

        "Cutter: No family. No money. No insurance, 'cause it was a suicide. [Smacks lips] So, they split me and my sister up and sent us off to our separate families. Wherever they'd send me, I'd take off and try to find her. Actually, I ran so many times, the state decided it was easier just to... forget about me.",
        "Stacy: That's horrible.",
        "Cutter: Actually, it wasn't. I eventually found my sister and sprung her. So at least we were together. I tried to take care of her. Told her I was gonna get her the life that we should have had. Still working on that. [Chuckles] Guess I got a little sidetracked.",
