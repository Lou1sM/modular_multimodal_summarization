        "The trial starts and Evangeline tells the story of how Spencer killed Thomas McBain. Rex needs Adriana to help with the meeting that he has with the lawyer's secretary. He has to get the records on Todd's kid to find him and so he will need Adriana to pretend that she is pregnant. Starr arrives home and Blair is suspicious since she is wearing strange clothes. \"My clothes got dirty, so I had to put these on.\" Blair is thrilled to hear that Todd caught the garter, but her smile fades when she hears that Evangeline caught the bouquet. She looks in Starr's bag and finds the shirt the girl was wearing the night before. It is ripped. Starr is angry that her mother was looking through her things. She said that she ripped the shirt herself. \"That is the style now.\" Detective Bauer arrives and tells there was an incident the night before. She is looking for Starr Manning. Starr is taken to the station where she tells that Cole was fine at first but then got violent. She says that he didn't hurt her and that her shirt got ripped by accident. Detective Bauer says there may be charges where Cole is concerned. She suspects drugs. The judge calls a recess. Evangeline is uneasy. Nora feels that Evangeline has made a wonderful start, and so does Chris. Evangeline can't help feeling that something is going to go horribly wrong. During the recess, David goes to his brother and asks him just how much money he was offering for silence. Spencer writes a cheque and hands it to David. Rex and Adriana pretend she is pregnant to get the secretary for Mr. Nivens to tell where his records are. They pretend they had a deal with Nivens to sell their baby. It is only when Rex offers the woman 20% of their payment for giving up their kid that Herman tells that she has the password and can access the files on any computer in the world. She thinks that she recognizes Adriana and finally it comes to her that the girl is a model. \"Really? When did you stop modeling? Did you get the 6 month Phy-Oxy test?\" Adriana says that she did and that is when Ms. Herman jabs Adriana in the stomach knowing now that it is fake. She tries to leave, but Rex threatens to tell the cops about her selling babies on the black market. She gives her password up to Rex to keep from getting found out. Rex hits the computer and sees that a huge amount of money was given to Mr. Nivens, and that the name of the parents are Joanne and Frederick Scott! Scott is the same name that the parents of Michael and Marcie's baby had. \"Oh no! Michael and Marcie have Todd's kid!\" Bo tells Nat that someone tried to dig up John's grave. \"It was me! John's alive!\""

        "Rex: Right. The guy was a baby broker. The problem is his office and all his records were destroyed in the tornado.",
        "Adriana: Well, do you think he would keep illegal stuff in his office?",
        "Rex: My thought exactly. He may have had some things stored somewhere else. That's why I'm meeting with his secretary today.",
        "Adriana: You don't think she's just going to turn them over to you, do you?",

        "Judge: This case is the commonwealth of Pennsylvania vs. Spencer Truman. The charge is murder in the first degree for the premeditated killing of Thomas Mc Bain. Dr. Truman, how do you plead?",

        "Nora: Knock 'em dead.",
        "Evangeline: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During this trial, I will prove that the defendant, Spencer Truman, murdered in cold blood police officer Thomas Mc Bain. He was a good cop, risking his life every day for his community. And he was a devoted husband and father. And when he was killed, he left behind his wife and his two young sons, Michael and John.",

        "Vincent: He's not here.",
        "Natalie: He's not answering his cell. Where is he?",
        "Vincent: Don't worry about it. We'll find him.",
        "Natalie: When? If it is John in that hospital, I'm not wasting one more second not knowing.",
        "Vincent: We've been waiting all this time. Another second won't make a difference.",
        "Natalie: You don't understand. I can't sleep at night knowing that John is dead, hoping that his death is a mistake. And then you tell me maybe he is alive. So I -- I'm wasting my time talking to you right now.",
        "Vincent: Wait -- ok, I get it. Now, don't worry, we'll find your uncle, but dumping it on me is not going to help.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. It's just not knowing is making me crazy.",
        "Vincent: How do you think I feel?",
        "Natalie: I'm -- I know. If John is -- that means Hugh isn't, and -- you must be going crazy, too.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. At least I ain't digging up graves.",
        "Natalie: I promise I won't do that anymore if we can just find uncle Bo and bring John back to life.",

        "Jessica: It's a good thing. Definitely a good thing.",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Because now the whole world knows that I've chosen to be with you for the rest of my life. When do we have to get ready for the flight?",
        "Antonio: We got a couple hours. Why? Is there something you got to do?",
        "Jessica: No. There's someone I got to see.",
        "Nash: We have got a big day ahead. First of all, we're going to go to the park. Then I'm going to read to you. And then -- what? What did you say? What did you say? You like spending time with me? Well, I like spending time with you, too. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. We haven't got to spend this much time together since I was planning my future with Jessica.

        "Natalie: Do you know where he is?",
        "Officer: Yeah, he's at the courthouse.",
        "Natalie: The trial -- I totally forgot. Uncle Bo is a key witness in this trial. I can't upset him now. I mean, his testimony is so important. And then Antonio's on his honeymoon, so I can't bug him. And anyone else is going to think I'm crazy.",
        "Vincent: Hey, I believe John Mc Bain's alive, too, so I'm just as crazy as you. But I'm afraid after we prove that he is alive, I'm out.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: During the course of this trial, you will hear testimony from witnesses that supports the facts. And the facts of this case tell a very sad story. During the holiday season, when officer Thomas Mc Bain was preparing to celebrate Christmas with his wife and his two little boys, the defendant, Spencer Truman, gunned him down in an alley and left him for dead. But, ladies and gentlemen, Thomas Mc Bain was a fighter, so he made it to the hospital. And he was still alive when he was handed over to the doctors entrusted with saving him. But one of those doctors was the defendant, Spencer Truman. We can only imagine the horror Thomas Mc Bain felt when he looked up at his doctor and realized he was looking into the eyes of his killer. Spencer Truman saw the look of recognition in Thomas Mc Bain's eyes. And with malice aforethought, made the decision to finish what he started in the alley. He was presented with a second opportunity, and he took it. He killed Thomas Mc Bain.",

        "Natalie: Oh, come on, John is not that bad.",
        "Vincent: Actually, I can't even blame him. After I told him about you and me kissing -- if I would have just known it wasn't Hugh, I would have never --",
        "Natalie: Why did you say that?",
        "Vincent: I thought he was Hugh.",
        "Natalie: It was just a dumb kiss.",

        "Rex: Well, then he's a bad lawyer.",
        "Adriana: Who was breaking the law. I think that automatically makes him a bad lawyer.",
        "Rex: Lawyers write stuff down, even crooked ones. At least, that's what I'm banking on. Oh.",

        "Ms. Herman: About?",
        "Rex: Mr. Nevins said he found a couple who wanted our baby. Said that they'd pay all of our expenses. But now he's passed away. And we just want to find our baby a good home.",
        "Ms. Herman: Go to an adoption agency.",
        "Adriana: Well, actually, we need the money -- more money than we could get through official channels.",
        "Rex: We just want the name of the people interested in our baby.",
        "Ms. Herman: I'm retired.",
        "Rex: How about if we give you 10% of what we get for the kid?",
        "Ms. Herman: I'm really very busy, Mr. Balsom.",
        "Adriana: How about 20%? How about 20%?",
        "Ms. Herman: Well, that's very generous. Thank you.",

        "Todd: Uh-huh.",
        "Blair: Yeah. I could use some coffee. You want some? Oh, you know what? Let's get the champagne out and we'll celebrate Cristian and Evangeline's future. Does that sound good to you? Daggone it.",

        "Nash: He's right. You sound just like --",
        "Jessica: Don't even say it. What I sound like is a justified, concerned mother, ok? And when it comes to my daughter's safety, I don't care who I offend.",
        "Claudia: I wasn't going to hurt her.",
        "Antonio: It's ok.",

        "Adriana: He just thought it would be easier to give up our by if he didn't know. Honey? It's a boy.",
        "Ms. Herman: Oh. Most families want boys. They pay a lot more for them than girls.",
        "Rex: That's great. Isn't it, honey?",
        "Adriana: That's great.",
        "Rex: Then I guess we should get this ball rolling. Find the couple who wanted our kid.",
        "Ms. Herman: Absolutely.",

Truman if the evidence supports the prosecution's case. And in this instance, it doesn't. Dr. Spencer Truman is an esteemed member of the Llanview community. He is chief of surgery at Llanview hospital. He's a respected member of the board there. And he won the Scarborough Award for distinguished medical research.
