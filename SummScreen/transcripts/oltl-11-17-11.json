        "Jessica and Robert Ford have spent the night together and have no regrets although they are not certain what to tell others or where they will go from there. At the airport, Natalie rushes to stop John from leaving for Seattle. Rex accompanies her and runs into Brody completely unaware that he intends to kidnap baby Liam. Cutter and Gigi/Stacy are not far away ready to board a flight for her to have \"reverse\" plastic surgery so that she no longer looks like Gigi if she is really Stacy. Rex has a \"premonition\" that she's not far away when he again sees the words: \"Don't Give Up\". And then minutes later he comes face to face with whom he believes is the real Gigi. Aubrey then knows she needs to find a way to help Rex, knowing that only she can unravel the mystery about what Cutter knows in regards to the Gigi look-alike whom Rex has seen. So she goes with Rex to find Gigi."

        "Jessica: Hey. You've been holding out on me.",
        "Ford: Hey. Uh, well, I made enough for both of us.",
        "Jessica: I mean, I-I didn't know that you can cook.",
        "Ford: For you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, that's not all you do for me.",
        "Ford: So, uh... no regrets about last night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi! Gigi! Wasn't her. Couldn't be. There's only one way to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: This is it, right? I'm gonna get my old face back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Shane? Hey.",
        "Shane: Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Aubrey: I'm picking you up.",
        "Shane: Why isn't dad here?",
        "Aubrey: Rex had something come up, so I'm taking you over to Roxy.",
        "Shane: Why? What's going on?",
        "Aubrey: She's over at Llanfair, so let's get your stuff and...",
        "Shane: Is something wrong with Dad? Did something happen?",
        "Aubrey: No, no, no. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Rex is fine. I promise.",
        "Shane: Then what's going on? I know something's up. What is it?",
        "Aubrey: It's about your cousin Liam. He was kidnapped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yes, I realize it hasn't been 24 hours, but we have an eyewitness, we know who took the boy, and we have reason to believe they crossed state lines, so that puts this on you, too, Gary. Thank you. I appreciate it. Y-yeah. Thanks. Yeah, just call me back.",
        "Natalie: What happened?",
        "John: Uh, the bureau's doing what they can.",
        "Natalie: Why'd you hang up so fast?",
        "John: Uh, it's just, um, you know, the sympathy, the condolences, I can't -- is your brother here yet?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Um, I-I asked him everything.",
        "John: Yeah, well, we're gonna go over it again, all right? There might have been something he forgot. He's the last person that had real contact with the kidnapper.",
        "Natalie: I can't believe that Brody did this. What did he do with our son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: This -- this will always be your bunk, kiddo... no matter where you live. You get home safe, all right?",
        "Viki: Clint?",
        "Clint: Liam?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Shaun? You're here early.",
        "Shaun: Hey, Little D. I just wanted to make sure that I was ready for your first Lamaze class. I've been reading.",
        "Destiny: You know, I think they'll go everything when we get there.",
        "Shaun: Well, there's nothing wrong with getting a head start. Have you been breathing?",
        "Destiny: Seriously?",
        "Shaun: They say that's the most important thing.",
        "Destiny: You know, I think they mean when you're in labor.",
        "Shaun: And make sure you get plenty of rest and to make sure that you eat plenty of nutrients. I brought one for each of us.",
        "Destiny: Mm, no thanks. Got my breakfast.",
        "Shaun: Takeout from the Buenos Dias? Is that the, uh, veggie egg-white omelet?",
        "Destiny: You know, I thought about that, but then I went for the chili cheeseburger with onion rings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: No regrets at all. Last night was amazing.",
        "Ford: You s-sound surprised.",
        "Jessica: I am but only in the best way possible. I need to recharge.",
        "Ford: Before breakfast?",
        "Jessica: For my Smartphone. Do you have a charger?",
        "Ford: Yeah, it's right over there.",
        "Jessica: [Chuckles] Thanks. This thing is always dying on me.",
        "Ford: Well, if you need to call home, you can use mine. I don't mind.",
        "Jessica: No, no. It's okay. No one's looking for me.",
        "Ford: Um, well, nobody's gonna love where you were last night.",
        "Jessica: Well, they don't have to.",
        "Ford: Uh, Jess, maybe we should just keep this between you and I.",
        "Jessica: It's okay. I can take the heat.",
        "Ford: Yeah, that doesn't mean you have to jump into the fire.",
        "Jessica: [Chuckles] Don't worry. I won't tell my dad.",
        "Ford: Well, it's not me I'm worried about.",
        "Jessica: I am. He's just getting used to the fact that you're Ryder's father. I can't even imagine what's gonna --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone beeping]",
        "Viki: No. Uh, Ryder's home.",
        "Clint: Hey, Ryder.",
        "Viki: Yep. I had a moment like that, too, when Inez showed up at the door. She was babysitting him last night.",
        "Clint: Was she? Did you have a good time, Ryder? Huh?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Clint: Well, we missed you. Glad that you're home. Wish your cousin Liam was home, too.",
        "Viki: I think he's ready for his morning nap, you know.",
        "Clint: Oh. All right, kiddo. Lights out for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And here we go. Here we go. And don't you worry. You're gonna be safe. I love it when they look like that. Not a care in the world.",
        "Viki: They don't know how to worry. [Chuckles]",
        "Clint: They can leave that to us. You heard from the police?",
        "Viki: No. Not yet. You know what? I think maybe we should just ban family weddings.",
        "Clint: It's not working out for us.",
        "Viki: No. But Cord and Tina got through their ceremony.",
        "Clint: Like I said.",
        "Viki: Clint, I am so stunned by what has happened. I mean, to find out that John is Liam's father, that Brody knew it all along, and then he came here and he kidnapped Liam...",
        "Clint: And now we don't know what Brody's capable of.",
        "Viki: Well, he won't hurt Liam. I mean, I would bet my life on that.",
        "Clint: Well, I don't know. Anyone who tries to take Liam away from him, they're in his cross hairs. Look what he did to Nigel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: [Groans]",
        "Roxanne: Viki is very short on the controlled substances, but these ibuprofessionals, they should do the trick.",
        "Nigel: I'll try anything.",
        "Roxanne: Sounds good to me.",
        "Nigel: Thank you, Roxanne.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, don't thank me yet, you know, 'cause these barely pack a punch.",
        "Nigel: Lois is picking up a pain medication the doctor prescribed for me.",
        "Roxanne: All right. Now, that's what I'm talking about. The \"do not operate heavy machinery\" stuff is on its way.",
        "Nigel: I believe so. I've been ordered to stay off my feet.",
        "Roxanne: Ooh, I hear that. Last night took it all out of me. I mean, can you believe that Johnny McBain is the baby daddy after all?",
        "Nigel: Oh, if only we'd known from the start.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, yeah. It would have been so much better for Brody and so much better for Nattie, also. Can you believe that whackjob Marty? She just didn't know when to quit.",
        "Nigel: You don't need to stay and tend to me.",
        "Roxanne: Like I got anything better I could do. Well, I could. I could be looking for Liam, but I can't because I got to wait for Shane. You know, the least I could do is take care of the family's first transponder.",
        "Nigel: Pardon?",
        "Roxanne: The guy on the front line defending Liam.",
        "Nigel: Not well enough, I fear.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, honey, you were up against Brody. You know, he's got those secret, uh, Seal moves, and he pumps iron like eight days a week. I mean, you need some serious hardware against him.",
        "Nigel: Alas, my nunchucks weren't handy.",
        "Roxanne: [Chuckles] Man, you got guts. You're a hero in my book.",
        "Nigel: Oh, I-I can hardly feel the hero while that baby is missing.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, he'll bring him home. I mean, Johnny McBain, he'll stop at nothing to bring Liam home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How you doing?",
        "Natalie: [Sighs]",
        "Rex: I mean, I know how you're doing, but have you heard anything?",
        "Natalie: No, not so far. There's an APB out on Brody and Liam.",
        "John: We're looking for anything you might remember.",
        "Rex: Okay, look, I had no idea what was going on, John.",
        "John: Okay. Well, I understand, but why don't you have a seat for a second, all right? Maybe there's -- there's some small detail that will come back to you.",
        "Rex: I was at the gate, uh, banging on a door just trying to get on a plane. I was just focused on the door. A-and then Brody grabbed me. He had a TSA agent with him. He got that guy to back off. I told Brody that he owed it to me to stop the plane. He didn't, but he did keep me from getting arrested. And then he said he had to go. I didn't see Liam at all.",
        "John: He was at the gate? That's it? Did he say anything when he left?",
        "Rex: He wished me luck.",
        "John: Okay, what's going on, Rex? All right, I mean, why were you so hot to get on that plane?",
        "Rex: Uh, it's not important.",
        "Natalie: Well, you said that Cutter got on?",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "John: Rex, come on, man. We can tell something else is going on here.",
        "Natalie: Seriously, if there's anything else...",
        "Rex: Look, it's not important.",
        "Natalie: Rex, come on. There was security after you.",
        "Rex: Yeah, because I was banging on a door!",
        "Natalie: Well, you wouldn't get so upset over Cutter, so what is it?",
        "Rex: All right. It was Gigi, okay? I saw Gigi get on the plane. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: You sure you're ready?",
        "Stacy: Yeah. I can't let Rex see this face again. It's not fair to him.",
        "Cutter: Okay. So, how does it look? This place -- I mean, you were here before, Stacy, so something's got to be familiar. Anything coming back to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Are you seriously gonna eat that?",
        "Destiny: Why? You want some?",
        "Shaun: How long have you been eating burgers and onion rings for breakfast?",
        "Destiny: It's what the baby wants. Who am I to say no?",
        "Shaun: You can't, but I can.",
        "Destiny: Shaun!",
        "Shaun: Eat this. It's got three grams of wheat germ.",
        "Destiny: No wonder you didn't want it.",
        "Shaun: It's not that bad.",
        "Destiny: Not as good as a chili cheeseburger.",
        "Shaun: Hey, I'm not the one with the kid.",
        "Destiny: What's what supposed to mean?",
        "Shaun: It means that you're a mom now, D.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, I kind of think I figured that out.",
        "Shaun: You're in charge, not the baby.",
        "Destiny: You think I don't know that?",
        "Shaun: I think when you see onion rings, your eyes glaze over. You need to be more responsible.",
        "Destiny: Oh, so now you're calling me irresponsible.",
        "Shaun: You have to think about the baby.",
        "Destiny: You think I don't care about this baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Viki: Hello?",
        "Jessica: Mom, what's been going on? I-I've gotten, like, a ton of messages.",
        "Viki: Oh, Jessie.",
        "Jessica: Mom.",
        "Viki: Uh, honey, can you come home, please?",
        "Jessica: What's going on?",
        "Viki: I don't want to do this on the phone.",
        "Jessica: Tell me.",
        "Viki: Something terrible happened last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: So, Nige, can I get you anything? You know, like some comfy food? Viki's got nothing but healthy stuff. There is so much tomato juice! Is there a ball coming up or what?",
        "Nigel: I have no appetite.",
        "Roxanne: Well, how about some tea? She's got all these teas that tell you what they do, like \"tummy tackler,\" \"deep-coat throat,\" \"bedtime berry berry.\"",
        "Nigel: Thank you. No. I abhor anything but a good, strong, proper tea.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, proper British breakfast tea. [Laughs]",
        "Nigel: Roxanne, I need nothing, uh, but your company.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, yeah. That's easy. I can do that.",
        "Nigel: We haven't spoken much.",
        "Roxanne: We talk all the time.",
        "Nigel: Not about... us.",
        "Roxanne: Us? Like you and me?",
        "Nigel: I would hate to leave anything unspoken or unsettled.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, baby, it's over. It fizzled.",
        "Nigel: That's a way to put it.",
        "Roxanne: You know, it's not like we had a big blowout or anything.",
        "Nigel: Are you certain you're, uh, reconciled to the situation?",
        "Roxanne: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah. Sure. You wanted to buttle, and I got a sweet hotel out of the deal.",
        "Nigel: It was the least I could do.",
        "Roxanne: Well, trust me, I been with a whole bunch of losers, and there was a lot less that you could have done.",
        "Nigel: I'm happy you bear me no ill will.",
        "Roxanne: What are you talking about? Was your life flashing before your eyes when Brody knocked out your lights?",
        "Nigel: [Chuckles] Perhaps.",
        "Roxanne: Listen, if you cash out, you got no bad karma with me because you are the best. You always were, and you always will be. You stood right up there for my grandkid. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, were you gonna follow them?",
        "Rex: I'm not going anywhere until we find Liam.",
        "John: Hey, \"we\" aren't searching anything, all right? This is a police matter.",
        "Rex: Yeah, right. Like you're gonna sit still.",
        "John: Thanks for coming in, Rex.",
        "Rex: Well, whatever you need.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Rex: I mean it. Anything.",
        "Natalie: Listen, are you -- are you gonna follow Cutter and this woman?",
        "Rex: No! I'm gonna be out working my contacts till we find Liam!",
        "Natalie: Well, right now, I think that's probably the worst thing that you could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I have to go. I have to go. I have to go pick up Ryder from your mother's, and I --",
        "Ford: Slow down, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: I have to be with my kids.",
        "Ford: W-what's wrong? Tell me what's wrong.",
        "Jessica: Brody kidnapped Liam.",
        "Ford: Oh, God.",
        "Jessica: Everything came out last night at the wedding.",
        "Ford: W-w-w-what came out at the wedding?",
        "Jessica: The paternity test. Tina showed up with the test, and it turned out to be true. Brody's not Liam's father, and he took off with him.",
        "Ford: All right. Listen. He's gonna be back. He's gonna -- he's gonna bring Liam back. He's just in shock right now.",
        "Jessica: No. No.",
        "Ford: Listen. Listen. Think about the time when -- when you first found out. You were shocked, too.",
        "Jessica: Brody didn't just find out. He's known that he's not Liam's father for quite some time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You don't want help finding your son?",
        "Natalie: I just...think that right now you should take care of yourself.",
        "Rex: What are you talking about? I'm not sick. Oh, God.",
        "Natalie: Rex, you're distracted right now, okay? And John is on thin ice working this police case. Any more civilians get involved...",
        "Rex: What? Like the cops never take the public's help while hunting down a kidnapped baby?",
        "Natalie: But we're gonna find Liam, and I need a distraction right now, so why don't you come with me and tell me about this woman?",
        "Rex: She looked right at me, Natalie, okay? Not 10 feet away. She looked exactly like Gigi. And I mean exactly -- the way she was standing... a dead ringer.",
        "Natalie: You know what this is.",
        "Rex: It must be part of Cutter's scam.",
        "Natalie: Right. So, do you really want to play into it?",
        "Rex: No, I want to find them so I can tell them both to go to hell.",
        "Natalie: Deep down inside, you really want this to be Gigi. Rex, just go. It's where you need to be.",
        "Rex: Look, I can't leave while you, your son --",
        "Natalie: I'm fine, okay? Go get yourself some answers once and for all.",
        "Rex: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: [Sighs] I can't believe Brody did this again.",
        "Aubrey: Again?",
        "Shane: Yeah. Brody kidnapped me once. For a long time, I thought he was my dad. When my mom was about to tell the truth that he wasn't, he freaked out and took me.",
        "Aubrey: When was this?",
        "Shane: A few years ago.",
        "Aubrey: That must have been really scary.",
        "Shane: Well, not at first. I didn't even get what was going on. It was just like we were going camping. He even taught me how to shoot a gun. But when the cops showed up, and he held me in front of him, then it got really scary. I thought they were gonna shoot him.",
        "Aubrey: So, you were a hostage?",
        "Shane: No. Brody pushed me away before anyone shot. But then the gun went off, and my dad got hit.",
        "Aubrey: Rex?",
        "Shane: Yeah. Then he fell on me. But I didn't even know he was my dad then, so I was only worried about Brody. Then they took him to St. Anne's, and they found out it was stress from Iraq.",
        "Aubrey: Post-traumatic stress?",
        "Shane: Yeah. I guess it came back.",
        "Aubrey: So, when did you find out that Rex was your dad?",
        "Shane: When we went to the hospital, my mom told me. I didn't even believe her at first. But she told me that if I didn't tell him goodbye, that I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I wanted to tell my mom goodbye at the hospital, but they told me she was already brain dead. So I guess she didn't even hear me.",
        "Aubrey: She heard you. Shane, I promise you. Wherever she is, she hears you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: No. Nothing looks familiar.",
        "Cutter: Maybe the doctor will.",
        "Stacy: If not, my old face has to, right?",
        "Cutter: Excuse, uh, me, uh --",
        "Receptionist: I speak English.",
        "Cutter: Oh.",
        "Receptionist: Your name, please?",
        "Stacy: Stacy Morasco. Um, I-I need to see Dr. Fascinella. Um, he performed some surgery on me about a year ago.",
        "Receptionist: Oh. I'm sorry. I wasn't here then. I'll get your file.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Um, it's Morasco. [Gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: All right, Vik. What's the word?",
        "Viki: I haven't heard anything from John or Natalie.",
        "Roxanne: Ooh, that doesn't sound good.",
        "Viki: Well, maybe -- maybe they have some sort of a lead and they just haven't had time to call.",
        "Roxanne: All right. I like the way you think. Hope they have backup because Brody ain't playing.",
        "Clint: So, how are you feeling?",
        "Nigel: I'm...rallying, sir. I'll prepare a breakfast.",
        "Clint: No, no, no, no, no, no. No, you're not. Lay back down.",
        "Nigel: But nobody has eaten.",
        "Clint: Nobody wants to eat. Now, the doctor told you to stay off your feet. Don't make me bully you here.",
        "Nigel: Very well.",
        "Clint: You know, you weren't supposed to be in the line of fire anyway. You were supposed to be at the wedding.",
        "Nigel: Well, the sitter canceled. It was my duty. It she hadn't, perhaps we'd be visiting her in hospital today. My place is here, uh, serving the family.",
        "Clint: Nigel, you're a member of the family. And the sooner you start thinking about that, the better. We let you carry a tray around just to humor you.",
        "Viki: I did talk to Jessie. She's on her way over now.",
        "Roxanne: Yeah. That's good... 'cause I know they've been fighting a lot, and I think Nattie really needs her sister right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: This is all my fault.",
        "Ford: No. How do you figure that?",
        "Jessica: Because I should have said something sooner.",
        "Ford: You did. Nobody believed you.",
        "Jessica: Well, I should have kept on trying. If Brody hadn't gotten away with it for so long... what am I saying? Brody's getting away with it for so long, taking someone else's kid... and I was worried about breaking his heart.",
        "Ford: It probably did.",
        "Jessica: The lying?",
        "Ford: Finding out that Liam wasn't his, you know, after the whole thing with Ryder.",
        "Jessica: I can't believe this happened again.",
        "Ford: I-I feel for him. I really do. I mean, Ryder's mine. I-if I found out that I lost him, I...",

        "Jessica: He was there when I was there. He was suffering from PTSD. He had shot a kid in Iraq, and when he had got better and he was let out, he was still just so focused on kids. I just never thought that he... I should have stopped this.",
        "Ford: No. You did stop it. You -- you got the right paternity test. There's no way you could have known. You did stop it.",
