        "\"You set this up Marty! You were just biding your time!\" Blair makes a move to whack the woman but Detective Bauer is there to see that doesn't happen. Todd is suspicious of Cole's involvement with his daughter. He thinks that Cole knew who Starr was before he started trying to date her. He becomes confused saying that he has no idea what Todd is taking talking about. \"Who are you people? How are you connected?\" The detective tells that there has been a tox screen done on Cole and the results are ready. He leaves and Marty starts explaining how she enrolled Cole in school the year before and at that time Starr wasn't there. She had no idea that Starr was there now. Blair doesn't believe her. She feels that the woman is the same liar that she was when she accused Todd of rape all those years ago. Marty says that her husband died and she felt disconnected and wanted to come home. Blair isn't buying and even tries to take a swing at the woman at one point. Dorian overhears Kelly talking to Clint about moving to London and that is how she is notified. She takes it badly at first but then Clint makes her realize that she has to let Kelly go if that will make her happy. Dorian does her best to accept what's going to happen. Evangeline preps David for his turn on the stand. He says that he is fine and has been ready for this his whole life. Bo thinks that Natalie is losing her mind when she says that John is alive but when Vincent comes and helps to explain things, Bo sees that there might be something to what the kids are saying. He can't tell Paige anything yet. She just got her son back and can't lose him again. The test shows that Cole has been on steroids. The owners of the house aren't pressing charges if Cole does restitution. The only thing to clear up is what exactly was done to Starr at the party. Cole apologizes to Starr and he and his mother leave. He explains about the pressure at school to win games and how it prompted him to take the steroids. \"Now tell me how you know those people.\" Marty tells that when she was in college, she met Todd and something terrible happened, that was very bad. She doesn't have to spell it out. Cole gets it easily enough. Starr asks her mother why she hates Marty. Blair doesn't want to get into that. \"Dad did you rape her?\" Todd admits that he did. \"Why are you always in such denial mom?\" Rex and Adriana are on different sides of the fence. He wants to keep Tommy's secret, and Adriana thinks that Rex needs to tell all he knows to his clients. They turn and Michael and Marcie are behind them with Tommy asking about their case."

        "Kelly: Hi.",
        "Clint: Oh, there you are.",
        "Kelly: Did Kevin's flight get off ok?",
        "Clint: Oh, yes. He had no problem. The last thing he said to me was, \"would you go see Kelly and the baby, make sure they're all right?\"",
        "Kelly: Well, Zane is doing much better. He's gaining weight, and the doctors think that they might be able to release him sooner than we thought.",
        "Clint: That's great news.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. That means I can join Kevin in London that much sooner, too.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Ready to testify?",
        "David: I've been ready my entire life. How do I look? Do I look good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Natalie, are you saying --",
        "Natalie: That John is alive.",
        "Bo: Oh, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Please, uncle bo, you have to believe me. I know I don't have any proof yet, but I can feel that it's the truth with -- with everything in me.",
        "Bo: And that's why you tried to dig up John's grave?",
        "Natalie: Of course!",
        "Bo: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: Please don't look at me that way, please.",
        "Bo: Honey, listen, I'm concerned about you, ok? I think you need help.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. No, you're right, I do. I need your help, uncle Bo, and I need it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How can this be? How in God's name can this be?",
        "Adriana: Hey! What's wrong?",
        "Rex: Todd hired me to find his son.",
        "Adriana: Yeah? So?",
        "Rex: Michael and Marcie hired me to find their baby's birth parents.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, I know that, Rex. What's going on?",
        "Rex: Todd Manning is Tommy Mc Bain's biological father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: This is your mother? Marty Saybrooke is your mother?",
        "Cole: Yeah? So what? Why's everybody so freaked?",
        "Marty: Cole, I -- um -- know these people.",
        "Blair: Oh, you \"know these people\"? \"Know us\"? You say it like we're some casual acquaintance.",
        "Todd: Blair --",
        "Blair: No, Todd. You screwed our lives up, Marty. You're the reason nothing ever went right for Todd and me.",
        "Cole: Will somebody please explain? Mom, what is going on here?",
        "Todd: He doesn't know?",
        "Cole: Do I know what, mom?",
        "Blair: You set this up, didn't you, Marty? You and your son planned this whole sordid thing, right?",
        "Marty: What? I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Blair: Oh, the hell you don't! You just want to punish Todd by hurting our daughter, isn't that right? Isn't that right, Marty? Oh, God, you're the same bitch you always were.",
        "Det. Bauer: Hey -- hey!",
        "Dorian: What is this about Kevin and London?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Kevin left for London today.",
        "Clint: Dorian, the London office needs a Buchanan there, and since I have to be here for my family, Kevin is stepping in.",
        "Dorian: But what does this have to do with you and the baby?",
        "Kelly: Well, I -- I wanted to tell you, I -- I tried. Remember, I -- I told you that Kevin and I are getting back together?",
        "Dorian: Yes, but I -- I chalked that up to hormones. I mean, you have just given birth to a baby, darling. You're not yourself.",
        "Kelly: No, I am myself. I am more myself than I have been in a long time. I'm focused, I know what I want. Zane has helped me figure a lot of things out.",
        "Dorian: The baby helped you figure things out? You're not making any sense.",
        "Kelly: Dorian, ever since Zane was born, as worried as I've been about him, he has given me this clarity -- and the same thing has happened to kev. We realize how much we mean to one another. This baby has given us perspective. He -- this precious new life -- we want to raise him as our son.",
        "Dorian: So you're doing this for Zane?",
        "Kelly: Partly, but I'm doing it for myself, too. I realize how much Kevin and I still love each other, how much we still need each other.",
        "Dorian: I don't know what to say.",
        "Kelly: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that you had to find out about it like this. I -- I wanted to tell you. I -- I just have been so busy with the baby and seeing Kevin off, I just haven't had the chance to call the family and -- and tell everybody my plans.",
        "Dorian: London?",
        "Kelly: I know. I know it's a big step. But as soon as Zane is given the all- clear, that's right where I want to be, because that's where Kevin is.",
        "Dorian: I'm losing my girls -- first Adriana, and now you.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I can't believe this.",
        "Rex: I don't -- I don't even know what the legal ramifications are of this -- what Marcie and Michael's rights are, or -- or Todd's. All I know is that Todd wants his baby found, and when he learns that he's already met him --",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Rex: Or when Michael and Marcie find out that their son's father -- what do I do, Adriana? What the hell do I do?",
        "Adriana: You have to tell them, Rex. You have to tell all of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Michael? I know that it, you know, feels like if Spencer gets what he deserves, then in a way, it's going to be easier for you to deal with the death of your brother. But the thing is -- is -- well --",
        "Michael: Is what?",
        "Marcie: Well, you're a father now. You know, I need you to remember that. I -- I need you, and -- and Tommy needs you, because I don't want to lose you to this.",
        "Michael: \"Lose me\"?",
        "Marcie: I know what anger and bitterness can do to a person, Michael, I've been there.",
        "Michael: Look at me. I promise you I will never forget what's important, and what's important is you and that little boy.",
        "Marcie: I love you, you know that?",
        "Michael: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: You're just going to answer the questions -- no jokes, no theatrics. You're going to be direct, straightforward.",
        "David: Stop lecturing me.",
        "Nora: David, it would behoove you to listen to her.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you, Nora. I just got to make sure.",
        "David: Have I not made it clear to you how important it is to me to see my brother brought to justice? Have a little faith. I'm a natural at this.",
        "Paige: Evangeline?",
        "Evangeline: Hi.",
        "Paige: Hi. You're doing an excellent job. Hugh will be so proud.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I -- I'm not losing my mind, and I'm not making this up.",
        "Bo: Natalie, I'm not saying that you're losing your mind. But when you go so far as to try to dig up John Mc Bain's grave --",
        "Natalie: But that's what I'm saying, it's not John's grave -- that's what I'm trying to tell you!",
        "Bo: Ok, if he's not buried there, then who is?",
        "Vincent: It's Hugh Hughes, and I can prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Det. Bauer: Enough! Anyone so much as makes a move here today, and I will make sure that he or she spends the night in lockup. Are we clear on that? Is this your son, Cole Thornhart?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Det. Bauer: Are you aware of what he's being accused of?",
        "Marty: The police called and said he was involved in some sort of violent behavior, which is obviously a mistake. That's why I came down here to straighten this out. I had no idea Starr Manning was involved.",
        "Blair: Oh, you are such a liar, Marty. You let your son out of his cage so he can hurt my daughter -- that's what you did.",
        "Cole: No, it wasn't even like that.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah?",
        "Todd: Cole, what was it like? You didn't know who she was before you became interested in her?",
        "Cole: I still don't know who she is! I mean, all I know is she's a girl that I go to school with, and that she's really smart -- and I know something about her family, but everybody in Llanview knows. What I don't understand is how you know my mother. I mean, how are you all connected, and why do you all hate each other?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hugh Hughes?",
        "Vincent: I'm the one who started this whole thing. I approached Natalie and I told her that I believed that John Mc Bain is alive.",
        "Bo: What were you thinking?",
        "Natalie: Please, uncle Bo, you've got to listen to him, ok?",
        "Vincent: Now, Hugh is an old friend of mine, and I checked on him many times in that Atlantic City burn unit. I talked to him, I spent time with him -- trying to get a reaction out of him, you know? But there was nothing, especially in the beginning. But then Natalie and I -- we said some things, and he reacted.",
        "Bo: \"Some things\"?",
        "Vincent: Yeah, the kind of things that would upset a man if he knew his woman was in the room with him.",
        "Bo: All right, look, because Hugh reacted -- probably involuntarily, by the way, when you consider how many sedatives they've been giving him -- but because he reacted to something that he heard somebody say in a casual conversation, that proves that the man in the bed is John Mc Bain and not Hugh Hughes?",
        "Paige: I'm still trying to get through to find out about Hugh at the hospital.",
        "Bo: I -- um --",
        "Paige: Is everything all right?",
        "Bo: Yes. Yes, everything's just fine. Uh -- honey, why don't you go ahead and you make your call and --",
        "Paige: Ok.",
        "Bo: Ok. That's her son. The man that's lying in that hospital bed in the burn unit right now is her son, it's nobody else.",
        "Vincent: Has Paige seen her son's eyes yet?",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Natalie: The man in that bed has blue eyes. John's blue eyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I -- I can't believe this. In my wildest dreams, I -- I would have never thought -- I mean, for so many people we know to be involved --",
        "Adriana: Well, and it goes beyond that, too.",
        "Rex: It goes beyond what?",
        "Adriana: Well, Spencer Truman is on trial for murdering Michael's father. But he's also charged with a ton of other things, including kidnapping.",
        "Rex: So you're saying the police knew Spencer delivered Margaret's baby -- and Todd's baby, and did something with him?",
        "Adriana: Spencer would know exactly who that baby ended up with.",
        "Rex: Well, I got to tell bo that. He'll know what to do.",
        "Adriana: Well, wait. Wait, Rex. Of course you have to tell bo, but don't you think the father of the baby deserves to know first? And the people who have been raising him?",
        "Rex: Look, this'll kill Marcie. Michael, too. And Todd --",
        "Adriana: What do you think he'll do?",
        "Rex: Well, he sure as hell won't let it be. I mean, can you picture him saying, \"oh, you know, my kid has a charming mom and dad who love him. Damn if I'll get in the way of that\"?",
        "Adriana: No, I can't.",
        "Rex: He'll want him back to raise him himself. I'll bet my life on that. And who can blame him? I mean, who the hell can blame him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, is somebody ing to answer me? I mean, how are you all connected to each other?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Det. Bauer: Yeah. I see. Thank you. The results of your tox screen are in.",
        "Marty: The results -- my son had a tox screen without my permission?",
        "Det. Bauer: Your son is facing serious charges. Procedure was followed here, I assure you.",
        "Marty: Cole --",
        "Det. Bauer: It's policy for the accused to be present when the results are handed in, so he's going to have to come down to the lab with me. Cole?",
        "Marty: There will be nothing in that tox screen. My son does not do drugs.",
        "Marty: So, Starr, you know my name? Who I am?",
        "Starr: I do, yeah.",
        "Todd: But Cole?",
        "Marty: Obviously has no idea what happened. And I ask that you please let me handle that with him in private.",
        "Starr: Did you know I went to Llanview high?",
        "Marty: I had no idea.",
        "Blair: Oh, you are such a liar. Just like you lied back when you accused Todd of raping you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm losing so many people that I care about. Even David. Well, not that that's such a terrible loss, but -- we do have a friendship, and now --",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Dorian: I'm losing Kelly.",
        "Clint: Dorian, you're not losing her.",
        "Dorian: No, of course not. She's only moving 5,000 miles away. There's always the phone, email -- post cards.",
        "Clint: She is doing what she needs to do.",
        "Dorian: Right. She's moving to London with her beautiful baby to be with Kevin.",
        "Clint: Come on, she loves the man.",
        "Dorian: That's why she had a child with his son?",
        "Clint: Kelly did not have that child with Duke. She got pregnant because Kelly and Duke were both desperate. And they took comfort in one another one time, one night. Kelly had that baby with Kevin, who was able to get by his betrayal and his pain. And Kevin was with Kelly every step of the way.",
        "Dorian: She suffered some great losses.",
        "Clint: Dorian, look at her. She's happy now. And from my point of view, more importantly, she's at peace.",
        "Dorian: And it's been a long while since she's felt that way.",
        "Clint: So then, can you let her go?",
        "Dorian: Oh. I have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Do you have any idea how horrible this is going to be? For everybody involved?",
        "Adriana: Well, not Tommy. He's too young to understand.",
        "Rex: Yeah, he may be too young to know what's actually going on. But you can't tell me he doesn't have feelings. That little boy sure as hell feels Marcie and Michael's love for him. And I'd bet my life he loves them back, in his own little Tommy way. I know. I've seen it. I mean, my God, Adriana, this kid has been orphaned twice now, and he is finally with a couple whose entire lives revolve around him, who want to give him everything they can and more.",
        "Adriana: Well, don't you think that Todd wants that, too? I mean, thing about it, Rex. You wouldn't have taken Todd's case if you didn't think that he wanted to give his son the best life possible, if he didn't want to take care of his baby and love him, right?",
        "Rex: No, I wouldn't have.",
        "Adriana: So you have to consider Todd's feelings in all of this, too.",
        "Rex: Of course I do. That's what makes it such a nightmare. There's too many feelings, too much potential heartbreak. Potential -- there is a 100% certainty that hearts are going to break left and right over this -- all thanks to me, brilliant P.I. that I am. Hey, everyone! Hire Rex Balsom to dig up your life's big mysteries. Whatever he turns up, you'll be sure to want to blow your brains out.",
        "Adriana: Ok, Rex, stop. Look, maybe there is a way that we can work this out so that no one gets hurt.",
        "Rex: Oh, and how can we do that? Oh -- wait, I know. I -- I could move to the Himalayas and become a monk. But that wouldn't work, because you'd still know the truth, and you're not too hot on keeping secrets. Not to mention, you're such a standup person. No. Never mind. It's not funny. Not even remotely.",
        "Adriana: I wish I could help you, Rex.",
        "Rex: I know what I'm going to do. The only thing I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hugh has brown eyes. John has blue eyes. The man in the bed has blue eyes. And John and Hugh were in the same pileup, so --",
        "Vincent: This is a case of mistaken identity. I'm thinking that there was a confusion at the accident and --",
        "Bo: And the wrong body was identified as John's.",
        "Paige: Oh, my God -- oh, no, it -- is that true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Is your memory failing you, Blair? I was here a couple of years ago to testify in Todd's defense. So why would I come back now to go after him?",
        "Blair: I have no idea how your sick mind works, Marty.",
        "Starr: What I don't get is -- you must have known I went to Llanview high.",
        "Marty: I suspected you might, yes. So I called the school before I enrolled Cole, and you weren't registered.",
        "Starr: I came this year.",
        "Marty: Oh. Cole and I lived in San Diego until my husband died -- a year ago, Christmas.",
        "Blair: Patrick died?",
        "Marty: I needed to get away from the memories and for Cole's sake. And the only thing that I could think to do was to come home -- hmm -- where I still do have some friends and family. I called Llanview, and when the high school found out that Cole was all-Staten football, they did everything they could to persuade us to enroll him. Hmm. My son is a good boy. He's honest and kind. And I would -- I wouldn't have made it through this past year without him. And -- so whatever has happened, really -- Cole? Please tell me there's been a mistake.",
        "Blair: So what kind of drugs did they find, huh? Was it coke --",
        "Starr: Mom!",
        "Blair: Ecstasy? Heroin?",
        "Det. Bauer: Steroids. We can do more tests, but it's clear that the steroids found in Cole's system are illegal. The school will be informed, of course, as will the parents of the boy whose house that was damaged. Now, they have said if they get financial restitution, they will not press charges, but there is a possibility of assault charges depending on what Starr is willing to testify to.",
        "Todd: We'll follow through.",
        "Det. Bauer: You're advised to keep Cole out of school for right now. This will all be handed over to the D.A.'s office and they'll see where it goes from there.",
        "Marty: Cole, we're leaving now.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: So am I. Sorry you had to be any part of this.",
        "Det. Bauer: I have to get to work on this. I'll be in touch.",
        "Todd: Starr --",
        "Starr: Just take me home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Natalie, could you give us a minute, ok? But wait for me.",
        "Paige: What's going on?",
        "Bo: I'm worried. I'm worried about Natalie, you know? She's grieving right now and it's -- she's trying to, I don't know, conjure up John. It's like bring him back, in a sense.",
        "Paige: Well, I -- I'm so sorry that I just interrupted like that, but when -- oh, when I heard you say that John's body was misidentified --",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, see, that's what Natalie's implying and that's what worries me, so I'd like to -- to talk to her. Maybe there's a chance I can help her.",
        "Paige: Yeah. Right. So you do that.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Paige: You know, Bo, I don't know how much time Natalie's been spending with Vincent, but I just want to reassure you that he's a really great guy. He -- he's kind and he's -- he's good and generous. He's been sitting by Hugh's bed so much lately and, I don't know, it just -- it means everything to me, and to Hugh, of course, so --",
        "Bo: Right.",
        "Paige: I just think he might -- he might be somebody who can, you know, be a support to her during this time.",
        "Bo: You know, I think -- I think maybe he can.",
        "Paige: And I'm sure he and Hugh will just pick up their friendship right where they left off -- when Hugh gets better. I'll see you.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Natalie: Did you tell her?",
        "Bo: No. No, she just got her son back and I -- I couldn't tell her that she may lose him again -- not right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex, talk to me. You said you know what you're going to do now. What is it?",
        "Rex: The thing is, if these people were strangers, I'd tell the truth and let them deal with it.",
        "Adriana: Uh-huh. Go on.",
        "Rex: But they're not. They're friends, people I've known for years and years and that I care about. That's why --",
        "Adriana: What, Rex? What are you thinking?",
        "Rex: That you and I are the only ones who are ever going to know the truth -- that Tommy is Todd's biological son.",
        "Adriana: What? Rex --",
        "Rex: Not Marcie or Michael, not Todd. We can never tell them, Adriana.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Kelly, I -- I still can't believe that this is happening that you're actually going to move to London with your beautiful baby to be with Kevin?",
        "Kelly: I know it's far away, but we'll come back and visit a lot and you can come visit us.",
        "Dorian: I know that I often seem very, very bossy and controlling, but I hope that you always know that it's only because I love you so much. You're like a daughter to me.",
        "Kelly: I love you, too.",
        "Dorian: But I have never seen you look more beautiful than you look right now or have this air of confidence. So, I say you go ahead. You take that leap. And if you ever need me, just know that I will be there with a net to catch you.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Uncle Bo, Paige has to know.",
        "Bo: Not now, not until I have absolute proof.",
        "Natalie: We do have proof. John has blue eyes, Hugh didn't. That can only mean one thing -- that Paige's son is not alive, and the one person who survived that terrible accident was John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex, you can't keep this from people.",
        "Rex: Why not? You'd rather I tear their lives apart, break their hearts? And for what?",
        "Adriana: Rex, this is no small thing, ok? This is a life we're talking about, someone's flesh and blood. Todd has a right to know that Tommy's his biological son.",
        "Rex: Todd has two great kids.",
        "Adriana: That is beside the point and you know it.",
        "Rex: Tommy's my Godson. It's part of my job to protect him.",
        "Adriana: Oh, protect him from the truth? Look, I know you feel terrible about this and so do I. I don't want to see Michael and Marcie suffer. I don't want to see Tommy's life turned upside down, but you can't keep this information from Todd or from Michael and Marcie. You just -- you can't.",
        "Rex: Ok, you're right. I have to tell them -- [Rex sighs] And I will. All I have to do is figure out how.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Wait.",
        "Cole: Can we just get out of here, all right? This place makes me nervous.",
        "Marty: Not until you explain to me how this happened. Why did you do it, Cole? I mean, after all the talks we have had about drugs, how you promised me you would never in a million years be so stupid. How you would never cheat that way, you would never risk ruining everything you had worked so hard far. So what caused you to break that promise to me? To yourself? What was it, Cole? You weren't a good enough football player?",
        "Cole: I wanted to be better, all right? I mean, the whole team was counting on me, coach and -- and the steroids, I mean, they were just there, all right? I -- I wanted to see what they could do. I mean, I never thought any of this was going to happen. I mean, I feel crappy about what happened with Starr.",
        "Marty: What did happen with Starr?",
        "Cole: I just scared her, all right? I mean, I -- I didn't hurt h, I swear. I mean, I could never do that. I was a real jerk -- I mean, more than a jerk, calling her things and -- and threw stuff. I know -- I know that what I did was stupid and crazy and -- and horrible, and I wouldn't ever blame Starr for not talking to me again.",
        "Blair: Hey. Stay down here so we can all talk, ok?",
        "Starr: What is there to talk about?",
        "Blair: I am sorry that you had to be in the middle of all this and I know that this must be hard for you.",
        "Starr: Why do you hate Marty so much?",
        "Blair: It's -- you -- you know, it just ticks me off that she planted her son in your school and set this whole thing up.",
        "Starr: And you're so sure she did?",
        "Blair: Well, it's obvious that she did, Starr.",
        "Starr: Why, because I would never be able to get a guy like that on my own?",
        "Blair: No. No, sweetie. I -- I didn't mean that.",
        "Starr: Look at me in the eye. Do you hate Marty?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Starr: But you did rape her?",
        "Todd: Yes, I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mark: You ready?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, you bet.",
        "Mark: Well, it's that time. The judge will be calling the court back into session any minute.",
        "Evangeline: We're ready.",
        "Mark: Oh, I look forward to your testimony, David.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. Like the man said, this is it. You ready?",
        "David: Point to the part of me that doesn't look ready.",
        "Evangeline: It's for you, John. I'm going to win this for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: It looks like the recess is about over. Uh -- I've got to concentrate on this case right now. Ok?",
        "Natalie: I -- I understand. Um -- this trial is important to the department and John. So, you know, do what you have to do and I'll -- I'll wait for you.",
        "Bo: Look, this stays between the three of us for right now, ok?",
        "Vincent: Yes, sir. I have some business that I have to take care of, but I'm on a cell. Call me if you need me.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Thank you. You know what? I'm kind of exhausted, too. I think I'm going to go on home, wait for your call whenever you're ready.",
        "Bo: No, I'll be in touch with you, Nat. Hey -- I swear I'll get to the bottom of this.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, uncle Bo, but can't wait. I have to see him for myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex, you are a kind and sensitive person. You can handle this.",
        "Rex: You're giving me too much credit.",
        "Adriana: No, I'm not. I know you and I know that whenever I feel bad, just being around you cheers me up.",
        "Rex: Great. So after I give everyone this horrific news, somehow, because I'm such a fun guy, I'll have everyone in stitches. A couple of gags, a few witty asides --",
        "Adriana: That is t what I meant. Look -- look at me, Rex. I just want you to have faith in yourself. You are a strong person with a good heart and none of this is your fault. You searched for the truth, you did your job. Todd hired you to find his son and you did. You can't blame yourself because it's going to end up hurting Michael and Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Hey! Look who's here. Look who it is, Tommy -- it's your Godfather.",
        "Adriana: Hi.",
        "Marcie: Yes. [Marcie chuckles]",
        "Rex: Hey, Tommy. Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Hi. [Marcie giggles]",
        "Rex: Michael.",
        "Michael: Rex.",
        "Rex: I thought you guys would be at the trial.",
        "Michael: You know, we were, but Lindsay was babysitting all morning. We thought we'd give her a little break.",
        "Marcie: Besides, you know, we get really antsy when we're away from this little guy for too long --",
        "Michael: We do.",
        "Marcie: Especially his clingy mom. I can't be away from him for more than two minutes! Where are you going? What you looking at?",
        "Michael: Anyway, Rex, I was -- I was wondering -- I mean, I was actually going to call you later on. Have you made any progress?",
        "Rex: Progress?",
        "Michael: \"Progress,\" he says. Yes -- finding Tommy's birth parents. Any luck so far?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Mom, I don't get it. I mean, who are these people to you -- Starr and her parents?",
        "Marty: I never wanted you to know about this. It was a long time ago and it has nothing to do with who I am now, who I was with your father.",
        "Cole: Please just tell me.",
        "Marty: When I was in college, I met Todd Manning. He was a football player, too, and something happened, something worse than what happened between you and Starr last night at the party.",
        "Cole: Well, what's worse than me freaking out and trashing a room? I mean, it's -- oh. Oh, my God. Huh. That thing at the dance when Britney tried to humiliate Starr about -- about her father raping somebody. That was you?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Starr: How come dad can admit what he did but you can't?",
        "Blair: Don't do this, Starr.",
        "Starr: I want to go to my room and I want to be alone.",
        "Todd: Go ahead.",
        "Starr: I always knew the truth, but this makes it so much worse -- meeting the woman who you -- and seeing her in the same room.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm sorry. What have I done?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Natalie: John is here somewhere in this hospital, mom, he's alive.",
        "Marcie: Is there something that you want to tell us?",
        "Rex: Yes. There is.",
        "Cole: Why isn't Todd Manning still in jail for what he did to you?",
        "Starr: What now?"
