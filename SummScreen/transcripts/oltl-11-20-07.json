        "Dorian: Oh -- oh. What have I done?",
        "David: The usual. Come on -- for us, it's the usual, but it's not our fault, you know. Clint started this when he kissed Nora.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, thank you, Silas.",
        "Matthew: Thanks. The pancakes were awesome. Isn't it awesome being here at Grandpa's mansion?",
        "Nora: Awesome, just awesome.",
        "Clint: Hey, good morning, Silas.",
        "Matthew: Morning, Uncle Clint.",
        "Nora: Morning, Clint. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Clint: Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.",
        "Nora: Well, you just about missed everybody. Renee took Sarah to the airport, and, um, Jessica and Nash, who took Bree for a walk.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I guess I slept in a little bit. Yesterday was a pretty big day.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, Natalie's still sleeping, I mean, so you -- you didn't beat her -- I mean, you did, coming down, but -- oh, dear, I hope Sarah didn't forget her purse when she went to the airport.",
        "Clint: It's not Sarah's. It's Dorian's.",
        "Silas: Would -- would that be Dr. Lord's?",
        "Clint: How would you know that?",
        "Silas: Well, she got here last night with a couple of friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: It's Nigel.",
        "[Chuck grunts]",
        "Chuck: Oh, Nigel. You shouldn't have.",
        "Nigel: I didn't. I trust you were able to get some rest, madam?",
        "[Alex mumbles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian Lord is here at the ranch -- are you sure?",
        "Silas: Well, I'm the one that's seen her first, Sir. I asked her who she was. I -- I told Nigel about it, Sir.",
        "Clint: And where is Nigel?",
        "Silas: I -- I don't know, uh, Sir.",
        "Clint: Never mind.",
        "Matthew: So, uh, what's going on with you and Uncle Clint?",

        "Dorian: Oh, please. Tell me this is a nightmare!",
        "David: Ow! You're supposed to pinch yourself.",
        "Dorian: How could this be happening? It's Nora's fault. Why -- why couldn't Clint see through her shameless advances?",
        "David: Because he's a man.",
        "Dorian: Right -- just like you are, you cad.",
        "David: Me?",
        "Dorian: Yes, you -- taking advantage of me this way.",
        "David: I'm a married man. You asked me to stay and \"comfort you.\" If anyone's taking advantage here --",
        "Dorian: You know what? This is an unmitigated disaster! Do you understand me?",
        "David: Hey -- I will hit you back.",
        "Dorian: Oh --",

        "[Paris, Texas]",
        "Gigi: I probably shouldn't make assumptions, but it does seem pretty obvious. You're a woman who's run away, taken her kid as far away as possible from his abusive dad. Am I right?",
        "Marcie: You wouldn't be wrong.",
        "Gigi: Alice used to help women like you before she left. Hey, what's your name anyway?",
        "Marcie: I'm -- um -- I'm Sally. Sally Ann Cavanaugh, and -- um -- and this is my son. This is Billy.",
        "Gigi: You've been lying to me, \"Sally Ann.\"",
        "Moe: Viki, we got company. Where you hiding?",
        "Gigi: Viki's not here yet!",
        "Todd: Excuse me. That's my flier. Where'd you get that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Well, I don't know about you, but I personally have had way too much of this hiding. We don't want to spend Thanksgiving day alone, do we? No. So what do you say Sally Ann and Billy -- we go across the street to the Bon-Jour Cafe, and we have ourselves a little date? Yes, would you like that? I know! I would, too. Come on, let's go. Oh, I got to get me purse, I forgot. Come on, let's go!",
        "[Marcie giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Who wants to talk?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Natalie: Uh -- it's open! Oh -- Jess, it's just you.",
        "Jessica: Were you expecting someone else?",
        "Natalie: No. No way.",
        "Jessica: Okay, okay, what happened last night after you met Jared, made us leave the old campfire? Did you kick him on his butt? Oh, God. Oh, he got to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Morning. Sleep okay?",
        "Nash: Yeah. You?",
        "Jared: Can't complain.",
        "Nash: You make the moves on Nat last night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jessica groans]",
        "Jessica: You let Jared kiss you.",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Jessica: Thank God.",
        "Natalie: I kissed him, too, and I liked it.",
        "Jessica: Please, please tell me that you did not sleep with him.",
        "Natalie: No, I didn't, but I might.",
        "Jessica: Okay, okay. This is going to end now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: If I did put the moves on anyone, I'm not going to talk about it.",
        "Nash: Good. See, Nat's my sister-in-law, so I'll tell you what -- you hurt her, I'll hurt you.",
        "Jared: Good. Now we got nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What do you mean, \"What's going on with your uncle Clint and me?\"",
        "Matthew: Oh, come on, I'm not 5. I saw the way you two were looking at each other, right before you wigged out about dr. Lord being here.",
        "Nora: We weren't looking at each other -- well, in any partic-- we weren't do-- I wasn't wigging -- I don't even -- I don't wig. Finish your juice.",
        "Matthew: So you and Uncle Clint like each other, huh?",
        "[Nora coughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You slept with David in my father's house?",
        "David: Nice bed, by the way. Is this one of those memory-foam things?",
        "Dorian: Shut up, David! Clint, we need to talk.",
        "Clint: Talk? Oh, yeah, that's the first thing that came to my mind -- a little chat. Why don't we start with why are you here, and what are you doing together in bed?",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? You have a hell of a lot of nerve asking me that question.",
        "Clint: Me?",
        "Dorian: Yes -- after what you've done?",
        "Clint: I haven't done anything.",
        "Dorian: Stop lying. I know all about you and Nora.",
        "Clint: \"Me and Nora\"?",
        "Dorian: Stop acting as if the two of you are not having an affair. Be a man and admit it.",
        "Clint: I am not sleeping with Nora.",
        "Dorian: Oh? I saw the two of you together, kissing in the stable, so don't try telling me I'm wrong.",
        "Clint: No, you're not wrong.",
        "Dorian: Then it's true?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I kissed her. But I didn't jump into bed with her like this. And if you were there watching us kiss, why didn't you come forward and say something?",
        "Dorian: Because I was so shocked and hurt.",
        "David: Um -- anybody mind if I put on some shorts? My wife could walk in at any moment.",
        "Clint: Your what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Oh, thank you ever so much for looking after our guest for the night. I do hope she wasn't too much of a bother.",
        "Chuck: Shoot, I've had worse -- cattle rustlers, horse thieves.",
        "Nigel: They are not even in Ms. Olanov's -- Mrs. Vickers' league. If I remove your muzzle, will you promise not to scream?",
        "Alex: [Muffled] Oh, yeah.",
        "Nigel: I can take it from here. Thank you, Chuck.",
        "Chuck: You need anything, just give a holler.",
        "Alex: Other than cutting out my tongue or killing me, you can't possibly think you're going to keep me quiet about this forever.",
        "Nigel: I'm hoping I can persuade you to keep quiet on your own.",
        "Alex: Oh, about what -- the fact that David Vickers is really David Buchanan, who is actually my husband, and everything that he owns, half of it belongs to me? There is nothing you can do to stop this.",
        "Nigel: I'm sorry, madam, but it will be over my dead body.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I believe he asked you a question. Where did you get that?",
        "Gigi: Um -- it was in the motel across the street.",
        "Todd: You staying there?",
        "Gigi: No, I have friends who do.",
        "Todd: Is that woman one of them?",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Todd: She kidnapped my son.",
        "Gigi: Your son? Is this him -- your husband?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Yeah, that's him.",
        "Todd: Yes, she kidnapped my son, and she's been on the run ever since.",
        "Blair: And we got a tip that she could possibly be here in Paris, Texas.",
        "Todd: So what I'd like to know, \"Gigi,\" is, why do you look like you have your hand caught in the register there?",
        "Gigi: I don't, I -- don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Blair: Um -- you know, it says right here that there's a reward for information. I mean, it's a pretty good reward, too, and if you could help us, I bet you wouldn't have to take any orders from that grouchy old man back there in the kitchen. I mean, you probably wouldn't have to worry about money at all for the rest of your little life.",
        "Todd: So, have you seen this woman and my kid?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I have.",
        "Blair: So you've seen them?",
        "Todd: They were here?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Todd: And where are they now?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. I mean, it was two or three days ago -- ate and left.",
        "Todd: Which is it -- two or three days?",
        "Gigi: Could've been three.",
        "Todd: Is it or isn't it?",
        "Gigi: I -- you know, I -- I don't know. I can't keep track of every person who comes in here.",
        "Blair: Well, did they say anything? You know, did -- maybe about where she would go with the child?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. She -- um -- let me see -- she said that she hoped she could get some food, that the baby would eat once they got to South America.",
        "Todd: She was headed for South America?",
        "Gigi: She might be.",
        "Todd: Which country?",
        "Gigi: I couldn't tell you that.",
        "Todd: You didn't ask her?",
        "Gigi: Why would I? Would you excuse me?",
        "Blair: Oh, Todd, I'm really sorry.",
        "Todd: Yeah, me, too. Three-day jump on us. What if she already left the country?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Blair: Who is it?",
        "Todd: Starr. Hey.",
        "Blair: Um -- is there anything that you could tell me about this woman or this -- this baby? I mean, was the baby all right?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, he looked fine.",
        "Blair: Okay, well, anything else? Something -- something maybe we could go on?",
        "Gigi: I -- I wish -- I wish I could.",
        "Blair: Don't you think it was kind of strange that this, you know, young woman with a baby, talking about going to South America?",
        "Gigi: Well, it wasn't really any of my business, you know?",
        "Blair: Well, no, I'm not -- I'm not getting on you. It's just that -- that my husband and I are really -- you know, really worried. This is -- it's hard.",
        "Gigi: Um -- what does your husband mean when he said his son was kidnapped? Are you the little boy's mother?",
        "Blair: No, no, no. Um -- the birth mother is dead, but he is the father, and he's really, really worried, and he wants to see the son that was taken away from him. And he wants to find this woman, to talk to her, and -- and to see his son. I mean, I don't know if you have children or anything --",
        "Gigi: I have a boy of my own.",
        "Blair: Well, then you -- then you know what hell he must be going through.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I do. I just really wish I knew who this woman was when I met her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Huh. You know, I don't know where my head is these days. I know, I know -- we cannot have Thanksgiving Day without Mr. Horsy. Now, where is Mr. Horsy? Mr. Horsy? Mr. Horsy, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: I can't quite remember -- is it one lump or two?",
        "Alex: Oh, I'd like to give you a lump right upside your head!",
        "Nigel: And that is why I cannot untie you, because I'm quite certain you would do your very worst to me.",
        "Alex: No, thank you -- you think? After you tied me up in this horse barn with the -- I don't care how cute he is -- ranch hand?",
        "Nigel: Oh, that ranch hand is actually the new owner of this horse barn, along with everything else on this property.",
        "Alex: The Buchanan family sold him the ranch?",
        "Nigel: Mr. Buchanan left it to him in his will.",
        "Alex: You got to be kidding me!",
        "Nigel: And he left the mansion in Llanview to Ms. Hanen.",
        "Alex: And nothing for his family? You really expect me to believe that?",
        "Nigel: It's true. And Mr. Buchanan's wishes are being followed to the letter.",
        "Alex: I know that Asa left David something.",
        "Nigel: Oh, nothing monetarily. There's some complicated instructions about company board seats for family members.",
        "Alex: Oh, I don't care about board seats.",
        "[Alex sighs]",
        "Alex: What do I have to do to get out of here, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: I want your silence.",
        "Alex: Oh, forget it! You can't expect me to stay quiet about this forever.",
        "Nigel: Indeed, I do.",
        "Alex: Well, go ahead. You may have gotten some little tricks from Asa, but you'll never be as ruthless as he was.",
        "Nigel: I've lived my life in service of Mr. Buchanan. That is not going to stop now that he's gone. And, unfortunately, Mr. Buchanan's last will and testament will not change, either. So whether you tell the family David Vickers is one of them or not, it will not mean the windfall you had expected when you married him.",
        "Alex: Nigel, there got to be something. There's got to be something we can work out. I didn't go through all of this to end up completely empty-handed. For God's sake, I heard you say that David Vickers was Asa's son.",
        "Nigel's voice: All I can tell you is that everyone will be enlightened when, as Mr. Buchanan said, the time is right.",
        "Nigel: Well, there is something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Yes, Clint, got married about a week ago. But don't worry; you have a full year to send a gift. Oh, no, I've already been caught in an adulterous act. Hey, do you think it counts if it's with an ex?",
        "Clint: David, you're just so weird, I don't even want to know what you're talking about. Yes, I kissed Nora, but it was a mistake.",
        "Dorian: Is that all you have to say for yourself?",
        "Clint: Yeah. What about you? What do you call this?",
        "Dorian: This -- is a mistake.",
        "David: A mistake?",
        "Dorian: I only went to bed with him because I saw you kissing Nora.",
        "David: That wasn't the only reason, was it?",
        "Dorian: Would you shut up? Just let me settle this with Clint.",
        "Clint: Dorian, there is nothing to settle. There's nothing to do, and there's nothing to say, except \"Goodbye, Dorian.\"",
        "Dorian: Clint, no! Clint! Clint!",
        "David: Well --",
        "Dorian: No, Clint --",
        "David: Yeah, go chase your cowboy. \"Mistake\"? She's got a lot of nerve. Do I look like a mistake to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I'll tell you what -- you stay away from Natalie, and I won't break your face again.",
        "Jared: Ha. Well, you'll be happy to know things have changed between Natalie and I.",
        "Nash: Really?",
        "Jared: You could ask her yourself. And I don't think she'd like knowing she needs a permission slip from her brother-in-law.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nora? We got a situation.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah -- yeah, we do.",
        "Dorian: You -- you jezebel!",
        "Nora: Good morning, Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I know that you can't stand Jared.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. No, well, can you blame me?",
        "Natalie: No, no, and I'm going to get him to stop screwing with you and Nash.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, he is screwing with you, too, and I cannot believe that you fell for it.",
        "Natalie: Could you please give me a little bit of credit, okay? Jared let his guard down last night, we talked.",
        "Jessica: Oh, yeah -- and you believed a word that came out of his lying mouth?",
        "Natalie: Maybe I'm starting to see him the way Renee does.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, Renee is grieving over Grandpa's death, okay, she isn't thinking straight.",
        "Natalie: Well, I don't see Jared as an operator out to get us anymore. I see him as a not-so-bad guy who's been dealt a bad hand.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, a hand that he's going to cheat with -- exactly like how he cheated Nash out of the vineyard.",
        "Natalie: Okay, but I'm going to talk to him, and I can fix that.",
        "Jessica: Oh! You don't know him, Natalie. You don't know what he's capable of.",
        "Natalie: Could -- could you maybe trust me a little here and know that I'm not going to do something stupid?",
        "Jessica: Stupid -- well, the stupidest thing you could do is sleep with him, and that's next to do on your to-do list.",
        "Natalie: You -- okay, you don't understand, Jess. He -- he was so different last night.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, he is scamming you, and I cannot believe that you don't see it.",
        "Natalie: The way he was looking at me was not a scam, and neither was that kiss. It was as real as it gets.",
        "Jessica: You know what? That's great. I hope you're right. Because if you're not right, Jared Banks is going to take you down, and it's going to be a very long fall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Honey, I think you need to go upstairs to your room.",
        "Matthew: And miss this? Yeah, right.",
        "Nora: Hit the road, cowboy.",
        "Matthew: Who's Jezebel?",
        "Nora: Now.",
        "Dorian: Good! Now that the kid's left the room, I can use the uncensored word I had in mind.",
        "Clint: You leave Nora alone.",
        "Nash: Clint, anything I can do to help?",
        "Clint: No, I got it covered.",
        "Nash: Okay.",
        "Clint: Go back to David. Enough is enough.",
        "Nora: David's here, too?",
        "Clint: Oh, you bet he is.",
        "Dorian: Nora, you are the one who set this whole thing in motion.",
        "Nora: What did I do?",
        "Dorian: You took advantage of this poor man when he was grieving for his father. You threw yourself at him, you slut, you opportunist!",
        "Nora: Oh, you stop -- one more word, I swear, I'm going to take that sheet and wrap it around your neck.",
        "Dorian: Really? Bring it on!",
        "Clint: Stop it, Dorian! Go put your clothes on, get David, and get out of here.",
        "Dorian: No, I am not leaving, not yet.",
        "Clint: You're walking out on your own two feet, or I am going to take you out --",
        "Dorian: You wouldn't dare.",
        "David: Clint, we need to talk, man-to-man.",
        "Clint: Yeah, that's a good idea.",
        "Nash: Clint --",
        "Clint: That's a very good idea.",

        "Alex: I knew Asa would leave David something.",
        "Nigel: Here is the deed to Mr. Buchanan's tropical island -- St. Blaze's, as you may recall -- and here are the keys to his yacht, the Jeb Stuart.",
        "Alex: He left his long-lost son an island and a boat?",
        "Nigel: Actually, no -- he left them to me. But I will sign them over to you newlyweds this very moment, in exchange for your eternal silence about Mr. Vickers' paternity.",
        "Alex: To keep David from getting his share of the real money?",
        "Nigel: My loyalty is to the Buchanan family, and Mr. Vickers would be a curse on that family.",
        "Alex: Oh -- don't be such a drama queen, Nigel. The Buchanans don't care enough about him to hate him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Don't shoot.",
        "Nora: Clint, put the gun down.",
        "Dorian: Clint, he's not worth going to jail for.",
        "David: She's right, listen to her.",
        "Clint: I'm a Buchanan and you're not, you're trespassing on my father's ranch, and you just had sex with Dorian. Believe me, Vickers, I would have no problem blowing your head off right this minute!",
        "Nigel: The Buchanan family's extreme distain of Mr. Vickers is no exaggeration. His brother was Spencer Truman, a man who tried to destroy the entire family. So there is no possible way that they will ever accept him into the fold.",
        "Alex: But they wouldn't have any choice if they knew the truth.",
        "Nigel: No, they'd have every choice in the world, because Mr. Buchanan did not die intestate.",
        "Alex: Without a will -- I know.",
        "Nigel: Yes, he left his belongings to specific persons with specific instructions. His lawyers assured the family that his will will never be changed or challenged, which renders your pursuit of easy money, well, fruitless.",
        "Alex: So an island and a boat? That's your final offer?",
        "Nigel: Take it, or I leave you with the horses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Who is this woman? Do you know her?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Actually, it's a very long and complicated story, but this woman right here is Marcie McBain, just like it says right here. And she and her husband adopted this little boy, and that little boy is Todd's son. And Todd was led to believe that he was dead, and had no idea that he was alive and actually had been adopted by people that he knew.",
        "Gigi: Did they know -- this Marcie and her husband?",
        "Blair: No, no one knew -- at least for a while and then when we found out, Todd took them to court, and he got full custody of this child. That was the time she took off with the baby and has been on the run ever since, and we've been looking for them, and so have the FBI.",
        "Gigi: I had no idea.",
        "Blair: Well, how could you? I mean, you only spoke to them maybe, you know, a minute or two, three days ago, right? Unless there's, um, something else that you're not saying? Is there?",
        "Gigi: Sally Ann, I would really like to help you if you'll let me.",
        "Marcie: Really?",
        "Gigi: Yes. But, listen, you can't stay at my place because it's barely big enough for Shane and me. But there's a place right across the street called the Bon Suites -- a friend of mine's living there now.",
        "Marcie: No, I -- I --",
        "Gigi: It's -- it's not very much money, and no one asks questions. So try not to worry anymore, okay? You and your little boy are safe here in Paris, I promise.",
        "Gigi: Uh -- this reward that you mentioned -- how much is it for?",
        "Todd: If you give me any information leading to my son, I'll give you $1 million.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Marcie neighs]",
        "Marcie: Here you go. Look -- yes -- oh, Mr. Horsy. I know. You know, I know that I've kept you cooped up in here long enough. I know that, and I'm so sorry, but what do you say we blow this joint, all right? Because nobody knows that we are here, except you and your mommy -- \"and I!\" Except Aunt Gigi, right? \"Right, Mommy!\" Right. I mean, besides, you know, they think I'm Sally Ann and you're Billy. \"Right, Mommy!\" Right. So, it's not like she's going to turn us in or anything. \"Right, Mommy! Right!\" [Marcie neighs] \"Right!\" Oh, I know you love Mr. Horsy. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Did you just say \"$1 million\"?",
        "Todd: Yes, dollars. One million United States Federal Reserve notes. It's all yours if you can help me find my son.",
        "Todd: Well, what's it going to be?",
        "Gigi: Um --",
        "Moe: Pardon me, folks, but I need Gigi to get her lazy --",
        "[Gigi mouths \"Go Home Now. Go.\"]",
        "Moe: Butt back in the kitchen.",
        "[Marcie mouths \"What? Okay\"]",
        "Gigi: Wait right here, I'll be right back. What is your problem, Moe?",
        "Moe: I need to know exactly where the hell Viki is this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Did you get anything more out of her?",
        "Blair: No, I think she's more interested in that reward than anything else.",
        "Todd: You think she really knows something?",
        "Blair: I don't know. If she does, I mean, there's no reason that she would keep it from us.",
        "Todd: Yeah, especially if there's $1 million involved.",
        "Blair: Well, I guess we're going to find out, huh? How's Starr?",
        "Todd: She's a mess.",
        "Blair: No word on Cole and Marty?",
        "Todd: No, she's home alone on Thanksgiving. I really think we should go home.",
        "Blair: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Todd: But not before we put a little more heat on Gigi of Paris, Texas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: I'm not hearing any explaining going on here.",
        "Gigi: Moe, those two out there are looking for someone and they are offering a million-dollar reward. Can't you cut me a break?",
        "Moe: Well, tell them to spend some of those bucks here while their loitering around. There's been more damn Yankees around here lately than the Bronx.",
        "Gigi: Moe, chill.",
        "Moe: Either they eat or they go.",
        "Gigi: Okay, chill. And as for Viki, she's not due in until later.",
        "Moe: All I know is I got five turduckens working, and the only two people I got in the restaurant are more interested in talking than eating. You need something?",
        "Todd: Yeah, my kid -- seen him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Oh, God. Did Gigi look worried to you, right? I know, she looked really worried to me. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, but our date is just going to have to wait, all right? All right, look -- um -- how about I make you cereal? Would you like that? Oh, God, Gigi, what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, I don't know about you, but I am so hungry.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, an all-night make-out session can do that to a person.",
        "Natalie: It wasn't all night.",
        "Jessica: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: I know -- you hate Jared. I get it, all right?",
        "Nash: Jessica?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- in here. Come on in, join the party.",
        "Jessica: You looking for me?",
        "Nash: Both of you. Your father, Clint -- he has a shotgun pointed at David Vickers.",
        "Jessica: Awesome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Clint, stop this madness! Really, put that gun down. You're not impressing anybody.",
        "Clint: I'm not aiming to impress, I'm aiming to kill.",
        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "David: Clint, you don't have to do this. I don't have designs on Dorian. What? You woke up this morning and said it was a mistake to sleep with me.",
        "Dorian: Uh-huh.",
        "David: She doesn't love me, Clint, she loves you. She does, and I'm not just saying that because you're holding a gun on me. In fact, she never would've slept with me in the first place if you hadn't have swapped spit with Nora over there.",
        "Nora: Clint, really, it's really important that you put the gun down.",
        "Clint: No, Nora, I'm not letting you take the hit for this.",
        "Jessica: Dad, what --",
        "Natalie: Did you forget to drink your coffee this morning?",
        "Clint: Get out of this house, Vickers, before I change my mind.",
        "David: Consider me gone. I'm turned around here.",
        "Natalie: So, how do you like hanging out with the Buchanans now?",
        "Jared: Huh. This morning went from 0 to 60 in about a second.",
        "Natalie: Could you do me a little favor, maybe, and keep an eye on Vickers, make sure he doesn't steal the silver?",
        "Jared: Yeah. Anything you want.",
        "Dorian: Clint, could I have a word with you, please -- in private.",
        "Clint: I don't even want to see you, much less talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Wrong room. They all look alike.",
        "David: What did he want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Clint, this is no way to end this conversation.",
        "Clint: It's not a conversation, it's a bedroom farce.",
        "Dorian: You're angry, you're upset, but you -- you cannot write me off because of one inconsequential misdeed, especially if I haven't written you off because of what you've done. We have got to talk, and we've got to talk now.",
        "Clint: Get out of here. What part of that don't you understand?",
        "Matthew: Am I allowed back in yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Your answer, madam?",
        "Alex: You got to let me out of this stinky barn. I'm sure my husband is just worried sick about me.",
        "Nigel: Mrs. Vickers --",
        "Alex: Buchanan.",
        "Nigel: My very generous offer of an entire island and a quite spectacular yacht has a time limit. This is my last and final offer. I need you to keep my secret. So what will it be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Maybe I should call Gigi. What do you think? Yeah? No, maybe -- maybe not because she'll call. She'll call when she can. I just -- I just wish I knew what was going on.",
        "Tommy: Dada.",
        "Marcie: Did you just say \"Daddy\"? Look, I know -- I miss him, too. I miss him so much. But, Tommy, Daddy can't help us right now, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: Take your wife and get a table, maybe order something.",
        "Todd: Maybe you should bite me. I have a few more questions for you, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: I'll be right out.",
        "Moe: You need a hand with them?",
        "Gigi: I think I can handle it.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I think you're right -- she's in it for the money. And she's kicking herself for not recognizing Marcie.",
        "Blair: Well, what are we going to do about Starr?",
        "Todd: Well, if it's true that Marcie's got a three-day jump on us, we might as well go home. Starr needs us.",
        "Blair: Are you giving up?",
        "Todd: No, never, but I think we should go home and regroup and take care of the kids we have.",
        "Gigi: Uh -- excuse me. I have something to tell you.",
        "Gigi: I remember seeing this woman in the picture and the little boy when they pulled out of the lot.",
        "Todd: What kind of car was it?",
        "Gigi: A minivan, silver. I don't know the make.",
        "Todd: That's not what she was in originally.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, we thought she might switch.",
        "Gigi: Sorry I couldn't be more help.",
        "Todd: Yeah, me, too. A generic minivan's not really worth $1 million.",
        "Gigi: I don't really care about the money. I just want the baby with the right person. Anyway, good luck.",
        "Todd: Let's go.",
        "Blair: Um -- you know what? Here's a couple more fliers, you know, if you want to pass them around, maybe, to some of your customers. Maybe they've seen her. Okay?",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Gigi: Moe, I'll be back in a flash. Sally Ann, you have some explaining to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I promise you that we will go out and we will do something soon together, okay? You know you've been such a really good boy through all of this, you do, right? And I know that it's been hard. I realize that. What, what do you want? You want your binky? Get your binky. There you go. But you know something? I'm doing this for you, right? You know that. Because I love you, and I never want to lose you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Marcie: Who is it?",
        "Gigi: It's Gigi.",
        "Marcie: Oh, good, it's Gigi. Let's go. Hey. Gigi? Are you going to tell me what happened back there in the cafe? Why did you tell me to go?",
        "Gigi: Why don't you tell me -- Marcie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You okay?",
        "Dorian: I've lost him. I may have lost him for good.",
        "David: Best thing that could happen to you.",
        "Dorian: Ugh.",
        "David: He tried to shoot me, you know.",
        "Dorian: Not now, David, okay, please? Just -- not now.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Are you okay?",
        "Clint: Oh, I will be. I just have to shower off this mess that I fell into.",
        "Nora: Well. Quite a morning, huh?",
        "Matthew: Don't ask me -- I missed all the action.",
        "Nora: Yeah, you did. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Think your dad needs you?",
        "Jessica: No, I think he needs to be alone.",
        "Nash: House is full of surprises, huh?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, just -- just ask Natalie here.",
        "Nash: Natalie?",
        "Natalie: I changed my mind about Jared -- and I don't want to hear a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Oh, all right, I'll take your stupid deal.",
        "Nigel: Are you quite certain of that?",
        "[Alex sighs]",
        "Alex: Yes, I'll take your island and your yacht.",
        "Nigel: All revocable if you ever breathe a word that David Vickers is Asa Buchanan's long-lost son. Are we clear?",
        "Alex: Crystal. Will you please untie me?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Viki: I think this is the most interesting Thanksgiving I have ever spent.",

        "Adriana: I'm thankful that you're all here to share this day with me.",
