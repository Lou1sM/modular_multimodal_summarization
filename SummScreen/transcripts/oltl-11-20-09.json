    "Recap": [
        "At the Seattle hospital, Todd comes face to face with Dani for the first time. She reveals that Tea is her mom. He reveals that Tea is his wife. And neither has a clue why they have just heard what they heard. Meanwhile, after Ross finds out for the first time that Todd is Dani's biological father, he knows that Tea and Todd could use that to prevent him from having any legal rights to his daughter. And he's willing to stop at nothing to prevent that from happening. Rex finds out that Jared has been killed after finding out that Mitch Laurence is his father, yet assuming that Mitch has been dead for a long time. He asks Natalie who was responsible for her husband's death. She admits it's Mitch. He is alive although nobody knows how or why. Mitch seems like he has magical powers to escape from prison. Meanwhile, Roxy knows that Stacy and Kim are up to no good and admits she's no longer afraid of their telling Rex the secret of his father since he already knows. Yet, she is also horrified to find out that Jared has been killed and is determined to find out what happened."

        "John: She's still pretty shook up, Clint. I don't think you want her driving. I'll make sure she gets home safe, but just give her a little more time. I'll tell her.",
        "Natalie: How's your face?",
        "John: You still got a good right hook. You couldn't rest?",

        "Natalie: Yeah. I had enough to drink. Besides, I need a clear head. I'm going back to California. To Napa.",
        "John: You know, killing Mitch Laurence ain't gonna solve anything.",
        "Natalie: It'll stop him from hurting anyone else.",

        "Rex: Great.",
        "Gigi: Don't lie to me.",
        "Rex: What can I say? I'm the son of a cult leader. No, I'm sorry, a murdering cult leader. Apparently, mood swings run in the family.",
        "Gigi: Honey, I know it's a lot to take in, but it could be worse.",
        "Rex: Really?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. You could still be with Stacy.",

        "Kim: Hold still.",
        "Stacy: Where did you get this thing?",
        "Kim: I stole it from the maternity department at Logan's.",
        "Stacy: Oh, my God. Who would wear one of these things?",
        "Kim: People who are trying on maternity clothes. People who are trying to get Rex to believe the kid is his.",
        "Stacy: Not gay boy's baby?",
        "Kim: Hey, gay boy did right by us. If it wasn't for Oliver Fish and his little fishies, you wouldn't be pregnant.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, just not pregnant enough.",
        "Kim: Which is why we got the padding, so it'll buy us enough time to figure out our next move.",

        "Stacy: That's your grandchild you're corrupting, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: With you as a mother? That kid is doomed.",
        "Kim: Nice.",
        "Roxy: Oh, shut up. Who asked you? So, what the hell do you want?",
        "Stacy: I've got a little job for you.",
        "Roxy: I don't care whose kid you're carrying. If you want anything done with that mop, you're gonna have to pay top dollar.",
        "Stacy: Ha! No, the hair is fine, thank you.",
        "Roxy: Says who?",
        "Stacy: What you're going to do is tell your son that you saw Gigi coming out of Schuyler's place yesterday morning.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Please, can we not talk about Stacy for just one day? It's bad enough I'm gonna have to try to raise a kid with her. Can she not be the subject of every conversation we have?",
        "Gigi: Sorry.",
        "Rex: No, I'm sorry. None of this is your fault. I just want to have one day where it's just us.",

        "Gigi: I thought she was still in California.",
        "Rex: Yeah. She stayed with Jessica. That was probably her on the phone.",

        "Natalie: I'll get some peace.",
        "John: Mm. Who cares if they lock you up for life, right? Your family will understand. You can lie awake in your cot at night knowing you took Mitch Laurence out.",
        "Natalie: I never liked your sense of humor. You're telling me that you wouldn't want revenge?",
        "John: I'd be planning it every waking moment. Which is why I'm trying to warn you away from it. This guy, he's -- he's taken too much from you already. Don't let him take your future, too. You gotta try to focus on your family and try to find some way to say good-bye to Jared.",
        "Natalie: How do I do that?",
        "John: I don't know. I guess -- I guess you trust that the people who love you will take care of you. Forget about Laurence.",

        "Guard: Can't help you.",

        "Todd: We haven't been introduced. I'm Todd.",

        "Dani: Dani.",
        "Todd: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were a girl.",
        "Dani: It's short for Danielle. Danielle --",
        "Rachel: You know what? I just left another message. Why don't we go grab some coffee?",
        "Todd: No, I'm not gonna go anywhere till I find out why you guys are lying to me.",
        "Greg: Nobody's lying to you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you are, because first you said that Matthew was alone in there and then this little -- this little rat comes scurrying out.",
        "Rachel: I didn't know that Matthew's social life was any of your business, Todd.",
        "Todd: Was he socializing? I thought he was recovering.",
        "Dani: I was just sitting with him. He just had surgery, you moron.",
        "Todd: Well, I just want to know why you can go sit with him and I can't. Just want to know what you're hiding.",

        "T\u00e9a: It was hard for me to accept at first, but the doctor assured me that the test is reliable.",

        "T\u00e9a: Ask the doctor himself if you want to.",
        "Ross: Oh, T\u00e9a, you paid someone to fix it. You had it -- you had it forged.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would I do that, Ross?",
        "Ross: Because you want Todd back, and you think that if you give him a child, my child, that he'll come crawling back. But if you think you're taking my daughter from me, you've got another thing coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, what's the big secret?",
        "Rachel: There is no secret.",
        "Todd: Well, then, why can't I go in the room?",
        "Greg: Because Matthew's in there resting.",
        "Rachel: And knowing you, you'll start pulling at his stitches until he tells you what you want to hear.",
        "Todd: And this -- this is not the thing you didn't want me to see?",
        "Dani: \"Thing\"?",
        "Rachel: I know it's shocking, Todd, but not everything revolves around you.",
        "Greg: His parents left him in our care.",
        "Rachel: And trust me, the D.A. and commissioner of police? They're not gonna take too kindly to the man that disturbed their son the day after surgery, so can we please --",
        "Dani: And what am I supposed to do? Just wait here until my mom comes back and drags me off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Ross -- Yes, I know it's not what you want to hear -- But -- Daniella's not your biological child.",
        "Ross: You're lying to me --",
        "T\u00e9a: No, listen, I never meant -- I never meant to hurt you. It wasn't intentional on my part. I believed Daniella was yours. It was only that one time with me and Todd. And then we were together, and I wanted to make it work with us. I tried to make it work with us.",
        "Ross: Until you thought you had a chance with Todd and you just took off.",
        "T\u00e9a: Things hadn't been good between us for a while. You know that --",
        "Ross: So, what? You just give up? That's it? Just run off? Run back to him? Look, you want Todd, you can have him. But Dani is mine. I'm the one that took care of her after you took off to -- deserted us for your career, Counselor. I -- I was there when she took her first steps. I was there when she spoke her first words. She's -- she's my daughter. She's my daughter and you can't just rewrite history to suit Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: I am not denying your connection to her, just your paternity.",
        "Ross: Oh, okay. That's great lawyering. Thank you for that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I am a lawyer with a lab test.",
        "Ross: The lab test is a fake.",
        "T\u00e9a: Then run your own test, Ross, okay?",
        "Ross: Okay. I will run my own test, T\u00e9a. I will. I will run it. Just tell me where my daughter is and we'll do this right now.",

        "Roxy: What the hell are you talking about? Gigi and Schuyler? Never in a million, trillion years.",
        "Stacy: Oh, save the act, Roxy. We heard you loud and clear in Rodi's.",
        "Kim: So did most of the room. Gigi did the nasty with Schuyler --",
        "Stacy: And you saw them.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, I saw them. I saw them having a conversation.",
        "Kim: The morning after.",
        "Roxy: And I was still flyin' high from the night before. Little pink elephants. That's all I know.",
        "Stacy: Only it was Gigi and Schuyler.",
        "Kim: And Rex deserves to know the truth.",
        "Roxy: They were just talking. Anything wrong with that?",
        "Stacy: Oh, nothing at all, unless you're doing it with your clothes off.",
        "Kim: Or the conversation goes something like this: \"Oh, yes, Schuyler, yes!\"",
        "Roxy: That I think I would've heard.",
        "Stacy: So, here's what you're gonna do, grandma. You're gonna go to Rex, and you're gonna tell him what you saw.",
        "Roxy: Why don't you tell him?",
        "Stacy: Well, I can't.",
        "Kim: He wouldn't believe her.",
        "Roxy: I wonder why.",
        "Stacy: Besides, this way you can score some bonus points.",
        "Roxy: By breaking his heart? No, thanks, honey.",
        "Stacy: Hmm. See, Roxy, this isn't your call to make. Remember? I know who you stashed away in that clinic. Whose blood you swiped for Shane.",
        "Kim: And if you don't tell Rex the truth about Gigi and Schuyler --",
        "Stacy: We'll tell him the truth about your little donor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Sit down.",
        "Gigi: Oh, please tell me this isn't about Shane.",
        "Rex: Shane's fine. John told me that Jared -- that he was killed.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. How?",
        "Rex: John didn't get into it. He just told me that Natalie's in bad shape and that I should get over there. What are you doing?",
        "Gigi: Well, you need to go.",
        "Rex: What about you?",
        "Gigi: Well, I would go with you, but I know that it's you that she wants to see.",
        "Rex: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Gigi: I'll be fine. You need to see her.",
        "Rex: I don't know how long I'll be.",

        "Schuyler: I wanted to wait till Rex left. I, uh, uh -- uh, what's wrong?",
        "Gigi: We just had some bad news.",
        "Schuyler: Not Shane.",
        "Gigi: No. He's fine. Jared Banks. He's dead.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, my God. He -- he used to come into the bar with his wife all the time. He was a really nice guy.",
        "Gigi: His wife is Rex's sister.",
        "Schuyler: I am so sorry. What can I -- what can I do?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, I don't even think that you should be here. I'm sorry.",
        "Schuyler: Right. Yes. Yeah. I just -- uh, well, you're okay, right? You're good all by yourself?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Rex just went to see his sister.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Sure. Sure. Well, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go. Gigi, okay, I'm sorry. The reason that I came over here, and I know the timing sucks. I just thought you should know Roxy was just at Rodi's giving me an earful about how you stayed over at my place.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God.",
        "Schuyler: And that's not the worst part. I think -- I think maybe Kim and Stacy overheard her.",
        "Gigi: Oh, great, and they think --",
        "Schuyler: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Oh, so -- so it's just a matter of time before they tell Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So if you think that you're gonna blackmail me into hurting my son, that peroxide has burned more than your hair, honey.",
        "Kim: Pick up the phone, Stace. Grandma here wants her son to know Shane's donor's name.",
        "Roxy: He already knows that, you pole jockey.",
        "Stacy: Oh, so you told him and you're still standing? No way.",
        "Roxy: Yes way. He already hates my guts. But you know, the only upside to that is that you two tramps have got nothing. So if you think you're gonna go after Gigi and Schuyler, well, you're wrong about that, because they weren't doing anything. And as for little junior here -- excuse me. My son is not gonna let a scammer like you raise his kid, and you know why? Because you remind him too much of his own mother.",

        "Mitch: Who better?",
        "Guard: Got a point. Whether the judge agrees, that's a whole 'nother deal.",
        "Mitch: So you don't hold out much hope for me.",
        "Guard: The way I hear it? You better pray. For a miracle.",
        "Mitch: Thank you, friend. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.",

        "Natalie: Hey, thanks for letting me get cleaned up and hiding out here and beating up on you. You didn't deserve it.",
        "John: What you said -- it wasn't wrong.",
        "Natalie: John -- if you told me that this was all the doing of a dead guy, I would have laughed at you. You were just following the evidence, like the good cop that you are, and -- You were a really good friend to me. And to Jared. And I treated you like the enemy. And I'm really sorry.",
        "John: Forget about it. Just try and take it one day at a time. That's all you can do.",
        "Natalie: I tried that when they told me that you were dead, but I'm not really that good at it. I should get going.",
        "John: Okay. You don't have to.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. I just -- I gotta make phone calls and decisions. You know. Don't worry -- I'm not going to Napa. And I'll bring your shirt back.",

        "T\u00e9a: Except for your reaction when the test results come back and you have to face the fact that you and Daniella are not related. I need some kind of assurance --",
        "Ross: That what? That I'm not gonna run off with her like you did? Oh, that's precious. So, what should we do, T\u00e9a? Should we chain ourselves to the radiator? Huh? Huh? No? I guess we're just gonna have to trust each other.",

        "Schuyler: You were drunk. You were upset. What do you want?",
        "Gigi: I should've -- I should've told Rex the truth instead of jumping at any excuse to avoid the subject. Now he's gonna hear an x-rated version from Stacy. Why I'm even worrying about this when Natalie just lost her husband and Charlie just lost his son, I don't know.",

        "Stacy: What do you think?",
