        "Cristian: Well, there's you, me, Mami -- whoa, whoa. What are you doing? Jamie, do me a favor and tell your dad it's not polite to eat with your hands. Tell him.",
        "Antonio: Jamie, let's count how many people are coming to dinner. There's -- there's -- there's me, right? There's you. There's Uncle Cris. There's abuela. How many is that?",

        "Moe: Can you tell Miss Powder puff over there she can leave right now if that's her attitude?",
        "Viki: Oh, come on, come on. We've l had a -- you know, a long, hard day. I think we should just dial it down. Come on, it's Thanksgiving, right?",
        "Noelle: Be so good as to ask Moe if he's going to enter that boring pumpkin chiffon pie he was serving today in my contest.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Moe: Since when is the Dallas bake-off your contest?",
        "Noelle: Since I told you I was going to enter it. He had no right --",

        "Gigi: Well, are you going to explain?",
        "Marcie: You know, I -- I really don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Gigi: I told you -- I know your real name, and that Billy is not your son.",
        "Marcie: Who told you that?",
        "Gigi: So come on, Marcie, let's hear it. Actually, you know what? Wait -- I want to see the real you.",

        "Nun: I raised $470 for the school.",
        "Bo: I think that's terrific, and you know what? For all the sisters, I brought you a big chunk of the bakery. I got apple pies, I got pumpkin pies and everything else. I want you all to have a Happy Thanksgiving.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: I got a nice price for it, though. I was able to pay the rent and the utilities, so there are no worries -- except everyone keeps asking for you. The art world misses you, Lindsay. So do I.",

        "[Rex yells and groans]",
        "Adriana: How's the turkey?",
        "Rex: Hmm, frying away. I just burnt my hand.",

        "Rex: Thanks for the concern, and no, it's not burning.",

        "Rex: This is just dinner.",
        "Adriana: It's Thanksgiving dinner. I don't think that deep-frying that turkey was such a good idea.",
        "Rex: Like I keep telling you, it's not about the turkey. It's about the sides, the -- the sweet potatoes, the creamed onions, the stuffing.",
        "Adriana: You never said anything about onions. I don't know how to make creamed onions.",
        "Rex: Would you relax?",
        "Adriana: Rex, we have several gallons of boiling oil perched on our fire escape. If we burn down the building, all those nice people that used to be your neighbors -- they won't have a place to sleep tonight.",
        "Rex: Nothing's going to burn down.",
        "Adriana: At least my mother's not coming -- could you imagine?",
        "Rex: Not a fried-turkey fan?",
        "Adriana: Oh, I can just see her pushing it around her plate.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Adriana: Oh, my God -- they're here.",

        "Adriana: Uh -- Rex?",
        "Rex: It's a baster.",
        "Roxy: This thing stays in the kitchen. I had enough baby scares for one year.",
        "Miles: Oh -- sorry. Hi, everyone.",
        "Roxy: Find a parking spot?",
        "Miles: Yeah, yeah, no problem. I brought some pumpkin bread.",

        "Roxy: I got one more guest coming -- another criminal type.",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Roxy: Well, well, well -- speaking of the devil.",
        "Michael: Uh -- Rox told me I should come over, you know? Said I shouldn't spend Thanksgiving alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I know everything. You're not a blonde, your name's not Sally Ann, and \"Billy\" or whatever his name is isn't your son.",
        "Marcie: His name is Tommy. And he is my son, Gigi -- he is my son in every way that counts.",
        "Gigi: Not according to the guy who stuck this on the vending machine last night.",
        "Marcie: Oh, what guy? What guy, Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Tommy's dad -- guy named Todd Manning?",
        "Marcie: No.",

        "Lindsay: Well, thank you for coming.",
        "Bo: Well, I didn't want you to spend this day alone. Of course, you're not alone because you have company. Yeah. I -- you know, I talked to Hank not too long ago and it sounds like everything's going well with him.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's -- he's still teaching and coaching, you know, trying to keep the young ones in line.",
        "Lindsay: R.J.'s managing my business while I'm in here.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, now, it's enough of that. You're going to beat this thing, so don't worry about it. And -- well, Bo, I've been meaning to get in touch with you since Asa passed. You know, I still can't believe it. Your father was one of a kind. I'm very sorry for your loss.",
        "Bo: Thank you. He lived a -- a full life. Thank you, R.J. I mean, you know what? That means a lot to me. Thank you very much.",
        "R.J.: Sure.",
        "Lindsay: Wow.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Lindsay: Well, a -- a civil moment between you two. I mean, this is almost worth the price of admission that I had to pay to get in here.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Lindsay: Could I ask you two to stay for dinner, or would that just be too much to ask?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay, now it's time to introduce you.",
        "Miles: Oh, okay.",
        "Roxy: Hey. I don't think he's been officiously introduced.",
        "Vincent: Vincent Jones.",
        "Miles: Uh -- Miles Lawrence.",
        "Roxy: And this is the lovely Layla Williamson.",
        "Layla: Hi.",
        "Roxy: And feel free to ask who did her hair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Thanks for keeping me company here on window duty.",
        "Michael: Oh, not a problem.",
        "Rex: Adriana's afraid I'm going to burn down the building.",
        "Michael: Well, Thanksgiving, you know -- it's usually a pretty bad day for accidents. Actually, it's one of the worst, you know? You got a bunch of amateurs, you know, trying to make a big meal for the first time. There's usually a line going right out the door of the E.R.",
        "Rex: No kidding?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Last year, it got so bad I got called in on my day off. It was my first Thanksgiving with Marcie and Tommy. Well, here goes round two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: He's here. Todd is here!",
        "Gigi: He came into the cafe asking questions.",
        "Marcie: Did you tell him that you'd seen me?",
        "Gigi: I told him that you and the boy had been in the cafe, yes.",
        "Marcie: Oh, great. Great!",
        "Gigi: Marcie, I didn't tell him you were here.",
        "Marcie: You know, he will go into every building in this town and he will not rest until he finds me.",
        "Gigi: No, it's okay. Listen to me.",
        "Marcie: No, no, it is not okay! It's not okay -- he's here!",
        "Gigi: I told him that you went to South America three days ago. He bought it. He thinks you're gone.",
        "Marcie: You did that?",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Marcie: For us?",
        "Gigi: Yes, and I don't know why, because he's offering a pretty big reward, Marcie -- a million dollars. I would never have to worry about money again. But I wanted to hear it from you first -- why you lied to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I didn't know you -- I didn't realize you guys were closed. I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: You're working today?",
        "Talia: I volunteered. I always do. My parents like to go to Florida every year for Thanksgiving and I can't wrap my head around turkey and palm trees. I'm going to go.",
        "Cristian: Wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "Talia: Because I got to --",
        "Cristian: Wait a minute.",
        "Talia: Yeah?",
        "Cristian: You came here for a reason, right?",
        "Talia: Yeah, I came in to get a sandwich. I'm hungry, I like sandwiches. I'm really going to go.",
        "Cristian: No, you're not -- you're going to stay and eat. Look how much food we have.",
        "Jamie: Yeah, stay.",
        "Talia: Uh -- I'm -- I'm not going to crash your Thanksgiving.",
        "Cristian: Jamie, do me a favor. Would you tell this beautiful lady or show her how much food we have?",
        "Talia: Excuse me. Wow. Wow, that's -- that's a lot of food. How many people you got coming to this thing? Five? Five people?",
        "Cristian: Yep. We'd have to wrap it up and put it all away. And you know, there's nothing sadder than leftovers.",
        "Antonio: Talia -- why don't you stay?",
        "Jamie: Please, please, please?",
        "Talia: Oh.",
        "Antonio: You have Jamie's vote.",
        "Cristian: Okay. It's settled, then. She's staying, brother.",
        "Talia: All right. I'd love to stay, thank you. Can I go wash my hands?",
        "Antonio: Yes. Jamie, why don't you show Talia the ladies' room?",
        "[Talia chuckles]",
        "Antonio: Not one word about my love life, all right? Talia and I work together.",
        "Cristian: I know. That's what I'm talking about -- love life, right there.",
        "Antonio: No -- you say one word about my love life and I'm going to tell Mami about you and Sarah.",
        "Cristian: Okay, come on. There's nothing --",
        "Antonio: No, no, no, no.",
        "Cristian: Between me and Sarah.",
        "Antonio: Word to the wise.",
        "Cristian: Whatever. Hmm.",
        "Carlotta: Hey, guys? Look who I found. And she's staying for dinner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You tell Bree her grandma sends her a big hug and a kiss, and of course I send my love to you, sweetheart, and I hope we talk soon. Okay? Love you. Bye.",
        "Charlie: So, did you get ahold of your kids?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Viki: No. Uh -- I left messages, you know? They're all out of town with their father.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, that's too bad. It's hard to spend the holiday without your loved ones.",
        "Viki: Yeah, yeah, it is. How about you? Did you hear any news about your son?",
        "Charlie: No, not yet. Listen, I really want to thank you for inviting me here tonight. This really means a lot to me.",
        "Viki: Well, it occurred to me that we're probably both feeling the same way, you know?",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm. You know something? I've got a question.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Charlie: Sit down. And -- and think carefully about this before you answer. Now, the other night at the movies -- now, that was a date, uh -- date number one to be exact. And we talked about taking a walk in the cemetery and that would be date number two, but then you asked me here tonight. Now that may have been just you taking pity on a guy who was going to end up eating a cold turkey sandwich on Thanksgiving, but maybe -- now, just maybe -- this is date number two. And, if and when we do take that walk, that'll be date number three and, well, then we're in trouble.",
        "Viki: Why are we in trouble?",
        "Charlie: Well, you see, three dates and a man has got to start thinking about springing for a box of chocolates or something.",
        "Viki: Oh, and that -- I mean, that's a real commitment.",
        "Charlie: Exactly, and so, um -- why don't you think carefully before you answer this? Is this a date?",
        "Viki: Okay. Um -- I think this is the most interesting Thanksgiving that I have ever spent. And when I thought about that, I thought that I would really like to spend it with you because I think that you and I are on the same journey -- you know, we're changing our lives, and we don't know what tomorrow will bring. So, I'm going to toss it right back at you -- what do you think? Is this a date?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Charlie: Well, um, if you had asked me a year ago where I was going to be at Thanksgiving, I'd say in a bar or at a party or at a party in a bar with a bunch of people that I hardly know getting drunk. And now, I'm here, getting ready to share a meal with a woman that I am so thankful to have met.",
        "Viki: Oh. Good answer. Good answer. Hey, Shane.",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Viki: Where's your mom?",
        "Shane: She's not here?",
        "Viki: No, honey, she's late. I wonder what's keeping her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I lied to you. The truth -- the truth is that I didn't want you to get into any trouble -- that's the truth.",
        "Gigi: Because the FBI is after you?",
        "Marcie: He told you that -- Todd told you that? Yeah, that's the truth.",
        "Gigi: And all that about your husband beating you -- that was a lie, too?",
        "Marcie: You asked me if my baby father was a violent man. I said yes because he is -- Todd Manning. He is a terrible person, okay, and I am not about to hand my son over to him! That's not going to happen. I'm sorry. Michael. My husband's name is Michael. I'm a teacher, he's a doctor and he's wonderful. He is -- I love him. Michael and I, we adopted Tommy and I swear to you, I swear to you that it was all legal, okay? We took him in because we thought that his parents had been killed. We took him in and we fell in love with him. Gigi, we fell in love with him, so we adopted him and we had -- we had absolutely no idea who his birth father really was.",
        "Gigi: And this Todd Manning?",
        "Marcie: He thought that his son had died. We all thought that he had died, and then when the truth came out, he took us to -- to court to get custody and he won and now he wants to take Tommy away from us, and I --",
        "Gigi: Marcie? But if he's Tommy's father --",
        "Marcie: No. Michael is Tommy's father -- I have already told you that! Todd Manning -- he is a monster.",
        "Gigi: He didn't look all that ferocious.",
        "Marcie: He is a convicted rapist! You want, you can go ahead. You can go ahead and you can look that up online if you want. He was almost executed for killing Tommy's birth mother.",
        "Gigi: Oh.",
        "Gigi: What happened?",
        "Marcie: Last minute, they found out that she was alive. He admitted that he wanted her dead and that he had tried to kill her when she was pregnant with Tommy, more than once.",
        "Gigi: But Todd's wife -- she said the birth mother is dead.",
        "Marcie: She died in an accident. So I guess you met Blair, then, huh? Tall, thin, stylish, really pretty?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Hmm. You know, Todd actually handed their son Jack off to strangers when he was a couple of days old. Strangers. Gigi, how do you do that? You know why he did it? Because he didn't think that he was his son. So what does it matter, right?",
        "Gigi: So, why did they give him custody?",
        "Marcie: Our lawyer said that the law is biased towards the biological parent. He's rich. Gigi, he can afford expensive haircuts and expensive clothes. Look, that reward money that he offered you? They throw money around all the time because that is how they get what they want. They don't know how else to get what they want. Tommy deserves a real family. He deserves me, not some family that they've cobbled together in order to impress a judge.",
        "Gigi: But, Marcie, I mean, if you're going to be on the run, what kind of family life is Tommy ever going to have? I mean, you're living out of your car, in motels. You've left your husband.",
        "Marcie: I left my husband because I would give my life for him. Gigi, come on. Do you think -- do you really think that I wanted to do this? I didn't have a choice in this situation. If a judge asked you to hand Shane over to a convicted rapist, someone who tried to kill his mother, what would you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I thought the idea was to spend Thanksgiving in Texas.",
        "Sarah: I decided to come back early.",
        "Cristian: You okay?",
        "Sarah: Yeah. You know, I told you they read the will. Asa read the will, on DVD. It was sad.",
        "Cristian: I'm sure Jared was a big comfort.",
        "Sarah: I don't think that's in his skill set.",
        "Cristian: So, where is he?",
        "Sarah: I don't know -- probably still back in Texas.",
        "Cristian: He didn't come back with you?",
        "Sarah: I didn't ask him to come back with me.",
        "Cristian: And why is that?",
        "Sarah: He's not for me. Actually, I don't think I was what he needed, either. We were just killing time, waiting for the right person to come along. So, I'm free as a bird.",
        "Cristian: Listen, if you're hungry, I've been cooking all day, so there's plenty of food.",
        "Sarah: Cool. I love a man who cooks.",
        "Cristian: And cleans --",
        "Sarah: And cleans --",
