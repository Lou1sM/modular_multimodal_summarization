He's ready to flee with the baby when John and Natalie catch him. At first he pulls a gun on them telling them he will never give up his son. But John convinces him to put his gun down. He cries and is devastated to know that all he ever wanted was to have a family. But he lost Shane, then lost Ryder, then lost Liam. He tells them he regrets lying and covering up knowing that Liam was John's. But Liam gave him hope and saved him from wanting to die so he took drastic measures. John and Natalie confess that they both understand and are not in any place to judge him. John remembers how she shut Natalie out, lied about his feelings for her and behaved irrationally when he was told that she got pregnant by Liam. She admits that she also lied when she heard Liam was Brody's, afraid of losing John and making Jessica hate her and behaved just as dishonorably as Brody has.

        "Brody: I know we're both tired, but we're gonna have to keep moving. But I... promise you, Liam, I'm gonna find a way to get us into Canada. Then we're gonna start over. All right? Just the two of us. Come on.",
        "Natalie: [Gasps] Oh, my God, Liam! You're okay!",
        "Brody: Of course, he's okay. What, did you think I'd hurt him? He's my son. I love him.",
        "John: It's over, Brody. Give us back the baby.",

        "Rex: What is this place, anyway?",
        "Aubrey: Dr. Fascinella? Why would Cutter come all the way to Brazil to see a doctor?",
        "Rex: I don't know. We're gonna find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: [Gasping]",
        "Stacy: Cutter, stop it! Stop it! You're killing her!",
        "Danielle: [Groans] Okay. I know he's got a room here and everything, but can we please have a \"no Jack\" zone?",
        "T\u00e9a: What happened?",
        "Danielle: [Sighs] We got into this stupid fight at the school, and guess who gets in trouble. Me. You know what? Brothers -- brothers totally suck. And don't try and tell me that I'll grow out of it. I love uncle Tom\u00e1s, but I know he drives you crazy.",
        "T\u00e9a: He sure does. Come. Sit with me.",
        "Danielle: Wait. Why? What happened?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well... speaking of brothers... you might be about to have another one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Dorian, before -- stop. Before you try to talk me out of it, you want to hear my choice or not? I'm ready to tell you. Tom\u00e1s. [Squeals] Okay. My ears, all right? Yes. Well, I'm glad that you're happy for me. No! No, I didn't. I didn't choose Tom\u00e1s because you sent your stupid David here to lecture me -- thank you very much. I can make my own decisions. Yeah. He's thrilled. We both are. Yep. It's official. Tom\u00e1s and I are together. We both couldn't be happier.",
        "Starr: What?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Louie Dupree? You here? Louie, it's Tom\u00e1s Delgado. Come on out. There's nothing to be afraid of. I just want to talk to you about Todd Manning. Louie. An associate told me Louie would be here. Did you kill him, too?",
        "Todd: I didn't kill Louie.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: But you made sure he couldn't meet me. Louie knows the truth, doesn't he -- that you killed Victor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey. Don't make this worse than it already is.",
        "Brody: No one's gonna take my son from me. No one.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Okay. Brody.",
        "John: It's okay.",
        "Natalie: What are you doing?",
        "John: It's okay. Hey. Brody's not gonna hurt anyone. You're not gonna hurt anyone, are you, man? Why don't you put the gun down? It's too risky. You got that little boy in your arms. I know you don't want to hurt Liam. I know you love him.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I do. He's my son. And I have every right to take him with me.",
        "Natalie: You'd take him from me? Brody, I'm his mother. What about Liam? He needs me. You know that. Come on, Brody. He's just a little boy. Please? Don't do this. Please? Just drop the gun.",
        "Brody: So John can drop me?",
        "Natalie: He's not gonna do that.",
        "Brody: That's what I would do.",
        "John: I'm not gonna pull my weapon on you. I wouldn't do that to you. And I wouldn't do that to Liam. Tell you what I am gonna do -- I'm gonna take my gun out. I'm gonna take it out nice and slow. And I'm gonna put it down on this table. And I want you to do the same.",
        "Brody: So you can take Liam? No.",
        "John: If we're gonna talk about this, man, we can't do that with guns in the room. If anything happened to Liam, you'd never forgive yourself. So here's what's gonna happen -- I'm gonna take my gun out, just like I said. I'm gonna put it on this table. Now you.",

        "Aubrey: Ele estava com uma mulher -- Gigi. English is fine, but I'm -- I'm sorry. I cannot help you.",
        "Rex: Okay. This -- this man, this woman -- have they been here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Cutter! Stop! Stop! You're gonna kill her!",
        "Cutter: That's the plan.",
        "Stacy: And then what? Okay. She hurt you! She hurt your sister!",
        "Cutter: She killed my father!",
        "Stacy: This won't bring him back! You're gonna end up in jail or worse!",
        "Cutter: I don't care! I don't care!",
        "Stacy: Oh, my God! Cutter, you're better than this. I don't want you to ruin your life!",
        "Cutter: No, I'm not.",
        "Stacy: Oh, my God. Yes, you are! You're not a killer, Cutter!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: What are you saying? Mom, what brother?",
        "T\u00e9a: Or maybe a sister or twins. Oh, my God. It could be twins. I guess anything's possible.",
        "Danielle: You're pregnant?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm. [Laughs]",
        "Danielle: How? I mean, I know how, but... Dad just died, and you've been seeing someone?!",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, mija. No. This is -- this is Victor's.",
        "Danielle: But he died three months ago.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm... I'm three months' pregnant. [Laughs]",
        "Danielle: Why didn't you tell me?!",
        "T\u00e9a: I just found -- I just -- I just found out myself, okay? I was so stressed after he died, I-I figured it was... when I was late, I figured it was grief or -- or -- or lack of sleep. And then, when I started getting nauseous, I-I-I got a test, and I'm pregnant. We're gonna have a baby.",

        "Blair: You know what, Dorian? I really need to go right now. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I'll talk to you later. Bye.",
        "Starr: You chose Tom\u00e1s over Dad?",
        "Blair: I'm sorry that you had to hear.",
        "Starr: When were you gonna tell me?",
        "Blair: Like now. [Chuckles] Sweetheart, I haven't really had a chance. I just made the decision yesterday.",
        "Starr: Did you even talk to Dad about it? I mean, did you even give him a chance?",
        "Blair: Yes. You know what? Actually, I did, sweetheart. I went to the office, wanted to talk to him about what happened on Halloween -- actually, what didn't happen on Halloween. I wanted to give him a chance to tell me how he felt before I made my decision.",
        "Starr: What did he say?",
        "Blair: He flew off the handle, accused Tom\u00e1s of railroading him, which is completely not true.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Blair: Everybody knows that your father didn't kill uncle Victor. Right? I told your dad that. But he didn't listen. He didn't care. He just -- he went nuts. All right? [Sighs] And watching him do that, sweetheart -- everything just came flooding back to me, all those fits of rage -- his moods, not knowing whether he was in a good mood or a bad mood. I don't want to live like that anymore, all right? I-I can't live like that anymore. So I needed to make a better, more sane choice in my life, and I chose Tom\u00e1s. And...he loves me. So, yeah. Tom\u00e1s and I are together now.",
        "Starr: And how does Dad feel about this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I was getting too close, wasn't I? Seeing you and Louie in your office.",
        "Todd: It's like I said -- he was just a business associate.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You were doing business, all right. You were paying him for his silence. And for the gun you gave him after you shot your brother.",
        "Todd: Last I'd heard, my dear mother, Irene, had killed Louie and dumped him in the Llantano river.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Only there he was, counting money in your office.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Good luck proving that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That explains why they couldn't find the body or the gun.",
        "Todd: Oh, the gun. That's right. This gun? This the gun we talking about?",
        "Todd: This gun is registered to Dorian l-- excuse me -- Senator Dorian Lord.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Right. You took it from her safe.",
        "Todd: Yes, I did.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And you told the police that it had never been fired, that ballistics could prove that you didn't shoot your brother. Only if that were true, you would have turned it in.",
        "Todd: What's wrong with you, Delgado? Wasn't it enough that you handed me over to Baker so that my lovely mother could torture me for eight years? I thought you felt bad about that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I did, and I do.",
        "Todd: Not bad enough to let this go.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Look, I made a promise to my sister to find her husband's killer. It's not my fault the trail leads to you.",
        "Todd: Okay. Let's just stop. I'm gonna stop you right there, okay? Why don't we stop pretending that this has anything to do with your sister and just call it what it is. You want me out of the way so that you can have Blair all to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know what? I don't know how your father feels about my decision.",
        "Starr: You didn't tell him?!",
        "Blair: It's none of his business. Besides, it's... he probably doesn't even care, anyway.",
        "Starr: Of course he would care! He's not gonna be happy about this!",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? That's his problem.",
        "Starr: Mom!",
        "Blair: Look, I made my decision, sweetheart. You cannot talk me out of it.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: Mom, this is so great! Oh, my God!",
        "T\u00e9a: [Voice breaking] I was holding him... when he was dying. I felt him leave. [Sniffles] And now it's like he's come back. [Sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You know them. You recognize their faces.",
        "Receptionist: I'm sorry. All of our records are confidential.",
        "Rex: Confidential? What is this guy -- a shrink? A psychiatrist?",
        "Receptionist: No. Dr. Fascinella is a plastic surgeon.",
        "Aubrey: Plastic surgeon?",
        "Receptionist: If you'll excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay. Cutter wanted me to think that Gigi was alive.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, come on.",
        "Rex: No, no, just hear me out. Now, there's a lot of money involved in this, and you know Cutter. He would do anything for a score.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah. But to get some woman to make her face look like Gigi's? That's insane.",
        "Rex: Then what are they doing here?",
        "Aubrey: Okay. Let's say you're right. Let's say this woman -- whoever she is -- already had the surgery. So, why did they come back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Cutter, she's not worth it! Okay, she already wrecked your dad's life.",
        "Alex: [Coughing]",
        "Stacy: Don't let her wreck yours!",
        "Cutter: It's already wrecked!",
        "Stacy: Then do it for me! Please! Let go of her!",
        "Cutter: You deserve to die.",
        "Alex: [Gasping]",
        "Cutter: The only reason I did that was 'cause of her.",
        "Alex: [Gasping] Thank you.",
        "Stacy: I did it for him, not for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: That's good, Brody. Thank you. Natalie, can you pick up the guns and put them in that drawer over there? It's okay. Nice and easy. Put them in the drawer and close the drawer and step away.",
        "[Guns clatter]",
        "John: That's good.",
        "Brody: This doesn't mean I'm giving up my son.",
        "John: I understand.",
        "Brody: You wanted to talk, John. What do you want to talk about?",
        "John: There's only one thing. Let's talk about Liam.",
        "Brody: You want to talk about Liam? He's a miracle. He saved me. When I lost Ryder, I wanted... I wanted to die. The only thing that kept me sane was this little boy.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Brody: I never -- I never meant to hurt you, Natalie. And when I heard that tape -- Marty saying Liam wasn't mine -- I-I-I couldn't believe it. It knocked the wind out of me. And I tried to tell you. I came so close, but I couldn't. So I erased the tape. Only then Patel... knew the truth. He left that note on your desk. I took it, destroyed it. I swore Patel to secrecy. But Victor knew, too. So... it kept getting worse. Every time I thought we were home-free... [Chuckles] Victor should have been easy... with everything he's done. But he finally decided he wanted to man up. He wanted to tell the truth, maybe for the first time in his life. I remember sitting there with Liam and Blair came in, and she was freaking out, saying Todd was gonna kill Victor. She was begging me for help. And the whole time, I'd been sitting there thinking how I was gonna get rid of him myself. When I left that night, I didn't know if I was gonna kill Victor or let Todd do it for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So, let me get this right. As long as you're around, Blair's yours for the taking. Is that the idea?",
        "Todd: She was my wife. We have children together.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: She was your wife. Not anymore. She's moved on.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah... because you had me thrown in a cell for eight years.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That's not exactly true, Todd. You and Blair were divorced before I helped you get out of town. And you have been back for months.",
        "Todd: I have a long to-do list. I've been very busy.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I really don't need to take out the competition. If Blair wanted to be with you, God bless. I even stepped aside to let the lady make up her mind, and she did. She chose me.",
        "Todd: Oh, don't flatter yourself. She's just mad at me. Blair's mad at me a lot, except when she's not mad at me, like when I saw her at the movie premiere and she kissed me. That's right. You were there. Let me tell you. It's like nothing had changed. Everything was still right there. [Sighs] We have a history. We have kids together.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm not here to take your kids, Todd.",
        "Todd: You're not taking anything away from me. The only reason she slept with you is because she was mad at me. Don't bother denying it. I was there. I heard the whole thing.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You broke into her house.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I wanted to -- I wanted to talk to her.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Oh, is that what you call it?",
        "Todd: Well, what do you call it when you break into somebody's house -- investigating? Don't even bother answering. It doesn't matter. After tonight, Tom\u00e1s, you are officially off the case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You have a problem with Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Starr: I just don't understand why you wouldn't give Dad another chance.",
        "Blair: We're talking about Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Starr: Okay, fine, Mom. Yes, Tom\u00e1s is a-a great guy. He's smart, he's creative, and he's cute.",
        "Blair: Mm...just cute?",
        "Starr: He's very cute.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Starr: He loves Dani and T\u00e9a, but every time I look at him, I think of the man that threw Dad in jail.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, he was just doing his job.",
        "Starr: And after all those years, he never questioned it?",
        "Blair: Of course he questioned it! Why do you think he admitted to murdering Irene? He wanted to keep your father out of prison, 'cause he felt badly about it. He feels terrible about it.",
        "Starr: Right. And I know that he says that he loves you.",
        "Blair: He does love me, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: But do you love him?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I do.",
        "Starr: More than Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: This baby is a part of Dad.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. [Sighs] I just wish he were gonna be here to help raise him or her.",
        "Danielle: I know. But I'm here. You know I'll help. And I'm gonna make sure this kid knows all about it. We'll keep Dad alive.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Voice breaking] You are the best daughter ever. [Sniffles] [Sighs] Someday, when you have kids of your own, you're gonna realize how precious you are to me. The love you feel for your kids... [Laughs] ...There's nothing else like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: What are you two beautiful people doing here?",
        "Cutter: That's none of your business.",
        "Alex: Really, Cutter. I don't understand this animosity. You've obviously done very well for yourself.",
        "Cutter: Oh, yeah. And you'd know all about that, wouldn't you, Mom?",
        "Alex: Well, just because we haven't seen each other in a while doesn't mean you can call me names. Seriously, I will make this up to you. I really will. I promise.",
        "Cutter: Not in a million years...Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Maybe she's here for a do-over.",
        "Rex: The look-alike?",
        "Aubrey: If Cutter convinced this poor woman to get herself made over to look like Gigi, what is she gonna do now? You basically destroyed their plans. She's useless to him looking the way she does. Maybe he dragged her all the way down here to get her done over as someone else. You okay?",
        "Rex: You know, it just hit me -- all those times I thought that I was seeing Gigi, everyone kept telling me that it wasn't possible, but it was. I was seeing her... only it was a scam. And I fell for it -- me, a private investigator, reformed con artist. I totally fell for it. [Sighs] My gosh. I-I had Gigi dug up.",
        "Aubrey: Okay, but -- but here's the good news. When you saw Gigi in the grave and you thought that you were losing your mind because there was no explanation for what you had been seeing, it was real. It wasn't a ghost. You weren't seeing things.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and that's the bad news. I wasn't seeing her. It wasn't Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Cutter, I think we should go now.",
        "Cutter: See ya, Mom.",
        "Alex: We just found each other.",
        "Cutter: And now I'm getting as far away from you as possible.",
        "Alex: [Sighs] Looks like you need a little help there",
        "Stacy: Rex and Aubrey. Oh, what are they doing here? How did they find us?",
        "Alex: \"Aubrey.\" Is my daughter here?",
        "Cutter: No. A different Aubrey. Shut up. All right. All right. We got to get out of here. He can't see you.",
        "Stacy: How? That's the only way.",
        "Cutter: Okay. You say you want to make it up to me. Well, here's your chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Think of it this way -- at least now you know the truth.",
        "Rex: All right, look. I appreciate everything you're doing -- you coming down here, okay? And I think you're right. I think that Cutter's little friend is definitely the ghost, but that still doesn't explain the messages... \"don't give up\"... the sign on the arrival-and-departures board, the message from the psychic, the waitress's check at the Buenos Dias. There's no way Cutter could have pulled all that off.",
        "Aubrey: Actually, I can't believe he pulled off the whole plastic-surgery thing.",
        "Rex: The point is, I could still be losing my mind.",
        "Aubrey: Or you're just grieving. I told you, Rex. I don't think you're going crazy. But when you love someone as much as you loved Gigi, you can get desperate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You didn't kill Victor. You couldn't.",
        "Brody: Thank you for that. No. I-I didn't. I couldn't take Victor from his kids. Somebody else did. So... I thought the problem had finally gone away. That's when I proposed to you -- I knew I-I could live with the lie if it meant that we could have the kind of life that we deserved -- you and me and Liam. And, Natalie, when I saw you coming down that aisle, you were so beautiful. And I was getting everything I ever wanted -- a family. I'd worked so hard. I'd been through so much. And then Tina comes running in with that -- with that paternity test, and I-I... I had to get out of there. I... needed to go see Liam one last time. Only, when I got there... he smiled at me. And I just knew he needed me. So I started to grab his stuff, and then Nigel came in and caught us. Is he okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, he's -- he's gonna be fine.",
        "Brody: I shouldn't have hit him. You know, he's the nicest guy in the world, and he was just trying to look out for you and Liam. He was trying to protect you... [Sighs] ...From me. You must think I'm a monster.",
        "Natalie: No, Brody. No, I don't think that at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: There's no statute of limitations on murder, Todd. And, given the notoriety of the victim, they're gonna work this case until they've got a suspect and they've convicted him and put him behind bars.",
        "Todd: Well, they're just gonna have to do all of that without you, because you are officially off the case -- permanently.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That's still not gonna save you, Todd. You can get rid of me. The LPD will pick up where I left off.",
        "Todd: Ah, I'm not so worried about that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I don't know why not.",
        "Todd: The Llanview police [Laughing] Department? And T\u00e9a -- come on. She's so convinced that I'm innocent that she's willing to represent me. Blair doesn't believe that I did it. Your lovely niece, Danielle, doesn't believe it. The only person... that seems to be a problem to me, Tom\u00e1s... is you.",

        "Natalie: [Sighs] I can't -- I can't judge you, Brody. I, um... I've been in your shoes. When I got the paternity results that said you were Liam's father... I didn't tell anyone -- not you, not Jessica, and... not John... because I thought if I told John the truth, I would lose him. So, like you, I... I justified it. And I convinced myself that I was protecting you and Jessica... and that I was protecting John... and that all the lies, that they were just, uh... they were out of love. But in reality, I was -- I was really only protecting myself, because I didn't want to lose what I had and I didn't trust that we could get past it.",

        "Alex: Someone should have taught you some manners.",
        "Cutter: Yeah. She walked out on me. So if you're serious about making it up to me for walking out on me and my sister and driving my dad over the edge, then you're gonna make sure that my friend and I get out without Rex Balsom seeing us.",

I know what that's like, and I was only with him for a few weeks -- best three weeks of my life. He's an amazing little boy. I didn't want to lose him, I didn't want to lose his mother, but I did.

        "Tom\u00e1s: You as much as admitted it.",
