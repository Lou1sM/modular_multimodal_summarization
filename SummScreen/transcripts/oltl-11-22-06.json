        "Starr goes to the stand. She starts answering Evangeline's questions but then something is wrong. Her head falls forward as if too heavy. She soon looks totally lethargic. She gets up from her seat and walks before the judge where she faints. Michael rushes forward and gets her conscious again. Spencer tries to get to her but the guards hold him back. Michael wants to call Todd but Blair will not let him. Roxy finds Nash in the restaurant with Brennan sharing a snack at their table. He acts like things are great, but Roxy tells him that she has been watching him and she knows that he has the hots for Jessica. Cole comes to see Starr and eventually she lets him in. He apologizes again for what he did. He knows that the steroids had a lot to do with it but he knows that can't be used as an excuse. Cole is at the school with Marty and he tells her that in spite of what he did to her all those years ago that will not make him go easy on Cole. He will kill the boy if he comes near Starr again. The principal returns to see if things are okay between the two, and again Todd asks her to kick that kid out of school. She can't do it without totally reviewing all that has gone on. Todd knows that will take 6 months. He can see that his daughter isn't safe in that school and decides he's pulling her out. Todd goes home and sees Cole in his house with his daughter. He shouts at the kid and takes giant steps over to Cole. He grabs him and tosses him into a chair, telling him that if he ever comes near Starr again, he will be killed. Cole jumps to his feet and they are nose to nose while Starr shouts at her father to stop! Todd throws the kid out and turns to his daughter telling her that this isn't negotiable. She will not be seeing that kid again. When he tells her that he has pulled her from the school, she gets hysterical and runs to her room. Antonio and Jessica are in Puerto Rico and they go to a restaurant where they kiss and gaze at each other. Jessica sees a man coming into their area over Antonio's shoulder and when she sees the man's face, for a split second she thinks that she is looking at Nash. Nash has the baby all to himself and he takes her out to a restaurant for snacks from a plate. Roxy crashes that party and makes herself at home with a bottle of 2004 wine. It was a very good year! Nash teaches her how to savor wine and while she is swirling it, he is reminded of the time when he taught Tess the very same thing. Blair thinks that her tumor is acting up like it did so long ago and doesn't want Todd to know about it. Michael isn't sure that is what is wrong with her but he offers to examine her when she has the time."

        "Todd: You can do one of two things -- you can wake up tomorrow and discover your face plastered to the front page of my newspaper with a very derogatory headline on top, or you can expel Cole.",
        "Marty: Over my dead body. Go after him, and I'll go after you.",
        "Todd: Whew. That's very good, Marty.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "Todd: So after what Cole did to Starr last night, you just waltz in and defend him?",
        "Marty: He made a mistake and I am sorry for what he did, but he's a good kid.",
        "Todd: I hate to break this to you, but Cole is anything but good. And if he ever goes near my daughter again, I'm going to kill him.",
        "Cole: Starr, please.",
        "Starr: Go away.",
        "Cole: I just need to talk to you, all right?",
        "Starr: I'll call the police.",
        "Cole: I won't hurt you, ok? I promise. I just -- I just need to tell you how sorry I am.",
        "Starr: You could say it through the door.",
        "Cole: I want to tell you face to face, all right -- I'll only be a minute, all right? I just -- I have something I need to explain. You know, I just need a chance to tell you -- I just needed a chance to explain what happened. Please, it'll only take a minute. Just one chance and then I'll leave, please. This is tearing me apart.",

        "Michael: Something's bothering you.",
        "Marcie: It's just what Rex said, you know? I mean, what if you were right? What if you were both right? Maybe -- maybe we shouldn't be looking for Tommy's birth parents. What if we are just looking for trouble?",

        "Adriana: Ok, you set?",
        "Rex: Todd paid me a lot of money to find his kid.",
        "Adriana: And you did. You're a good P.I., Rex.",
        "Rex: But how am I supposed to tell Marcie and Michael? They love that little guy so much and there is no doubt that he is one lucky kid to have them as parents.",
        "Adriana: Come on, let's go back to your place. We'll figure it out.",

        "Antonio: Wow.",
        "Man: Buenos tardes, Senor and senora Vega. Welcome to the old San Juan hotel. Please. Relax and enjoy the music. I will make sure the honeymoon suite is ready.",
        "Antonio: Muchisima gracias. Gracias, mi amigo.",
        "Waiter: De nada, senor.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Antonio: Wow. Well -- To the most beautiful woman in the world. I am truly blessed to be able to call you my wife. I love you, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: I love you so much, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Mmm. Is something wrong? Was it my horrible attempt at a Spanish accent?",
        "Jessica: No. No, of course not. I mean, how can anything be wrong? I just think that we need some more drinks.",
        "Antonio: You haven't touched that one.",

        "Adriana: You are so beautiful, look at you.",
        "Nash: Yes, she is. It is so nice to be the one in charge of taking care of her for a while. Who knew daddy would be so happy that Jessica and Antonio went away for a honeymoon, huh? Hmm?",

        "Judge: Ms. Williamson?",
        "Evangeline: Would you please state your name for the record?",

        "Michael: It doesn't matter who his biological parents are.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but then -- then why would Rex say that they might be able to take him back?",
        "Michael: Because Rex is being overcautious. Tommy is ours, honey. Nothing, nothing will change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: We should jam.",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Hey, if you ever need a babysitter --",

        "Roxy: How about if I buy Adriana and Rexy Wexy a brewski-twoski?",
        "Rex: Thanks, Roxy, but we got to go.",
        "Roxy: Oh, I get it -- a little afternoon delight.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Roxy: Hot pockets at night",
        "Rex: Roxy, I said we got to go -- please.",
        "Roxy: Oh, sheesh. You know, why don't you take him home, get him to relax, and then have him get out on the right side of the bed this time?",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry, Roxy. Rex is kind of under a lot of pressure, but we'll have drinks with you next time.",
        "Roxy: You know, you bet your bottom dollar on that. And, you know, don't string me along.",
        "Adriana: I wouldn't dream of it.",
        "Roxy: You know, we should play that game again -- you know, the one with the morays and the ethics?",
        "Adriana: You bet.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I love that game. And those questions -- you know, some of them were doozies, because it's really hard to figure out the right thing to do especially when you're a Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Principal Wexler: Please. Mr. Manning, there's no need for threats of any kind.",
        "Todd: Well, that wasn't threat. That was a promise.",
        "Marty: You lay one finger on Cole and the only way you are coming out of prison is on a gurney the way it should've been years ago.",
        "Todd: Can I have a word with her alone, please?",
        "Principal Wexler: That is out of the question. I'm sorry, Mr. Manning, but I have to question your self-restraint right now.",
        "Marty: Huh, it's ok. He won't hurt me.",
        "Principal Wexler: I don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Marty: I can handle him. And he's right -- we do have some things we need to discuss alone.",
        "Principal Wexler: Are you sure you'll be all right?",
        "Marty: Yeah. He'll never hurt me again.",
        "Principal Wexler: It's against my better judgment, but if you need me, I'll be in the hall.",
        "Marty: I shouldn't have said that. Ahem. This isn't about what happened to me at a party back in college. This is about what happened at a party last night between my son and your daughter.",
        "Todd: No, your son happened to my daughter. He attacked her, obviously for payback.",
        "Marty: You were there. He didn't know anything about the rape until this morning. The only thing that was the same is that you both play football and you both weren't in your right mind. Unlike you, my son is a gentle, quiet kid.",
        "Todd: Ha. Could've fooled me.",
        "Marty: Yeah, that could've been the steroids -- and I'm not saying it's an excuse because it's not. But you've seen the evidence -- anger and aggression are major side effects. He wasn't in his right mind. If -- he wouldn't have even raised his voice if he wasn't taking those drugs. Look, I can guarantee that he will never take steroids, or any other drug for that matter, ever again.",
        "Todd: You sound very sure of yourself.",
        "Marty: I am.",
        "Todd: That's funny because you as this renowned psychiatrist, this studier of human behavior -- you didn't know he was taking them. So how can you possibly guarantee he'll never do it again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Can I come in? Please?",
        "Starr: You had something to say to me?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: You already said that outside and at the police station.",
        "Cole: I know, but, see, it's not even like that. I mean, when somebody steps on your toes, they say \"I'm sorry,\" and that's it and it's not -- it's not that big of a deal. They just step on your toes and ok, that's it. And when I say \"I'm sorry,\" it kind of sounds like the same thing, like I just stepped on your toes and that's it. It's not a big deal. Wow. I should've paid a lot more attention in English class because I know there are words for how I feel. I just don't know what they are or how to say them. You know what I mean?",
        "Starr: Go on.",
        "Cole: See, when I brought you up in that room and I started yelling at you, I felt like I was just somebody up in the bleachers and -- watching somebody go off on their girlfriend and I was so mad like I -- I just wanted to kick their ass because they were yelling at somebody that I care about, somebody that I care about a lot. But --",
        "Starr: But?",
        "Cole: I couldn't do anything to stop him, you know? He was just out of control and -- and I was just a spectator. Do you remember what you said to me?",
        "Starr: I said a lot of things.",
        "Cole: You said, \"this isn't you.\" Remember?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Well, you were right. I mean, it wasn't me. That's not me. I -- I'm not that guy.",
        "Starr: So it was the drugs, huh?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: This isn't your fault -- is that what you expect me to believe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: What were the circumstances of your first meeting with the defendant?",
        "Blair: He used a knife on my son.",
        "Mark: Objection -- vague and inflammatory.",
        "Judge: Overruled. Would you please clarify that statement, Ms. Cramer?",
        "Blair: My son was having difficulty breathing, so I took him to the hospital and dr. Truman used a knife on him.",
        "Evangeline: And after the initial meeting at the hospital, did you come to know the defendant on a personal level?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Evangeline: And how did the personal relationship begin?",
        "Blair: He began to pursue me.",
        "Evangeline: Romantically?",
        "Mark: Objection. Leading the witness.",
        "Judge: Rephrase the question, please.",
        "Evangeline: Of course, your honor. In what way did the defendant pursue you?",
        "Blair: Romantically.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you, Ms. Cramer. And when you first, um -- Ms. Cramer, can I get you a glass of water?",
        "Blair: Just, you know what?",
        "Judge: Ms. Cramer --",
        "Blair: Yeah, I really --",
        "Judge: Ms. Cramer, please sit back down -- you have not been given permission --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: One for Brennan -- [Nash exhales] Ok, and one for daddy.",
        "Roxy: Enjoy it now because in another couple of years, ain't going to be nothing but heartache and bail money.",
        "Nash: Well, my Brennan would never break my heart, would you? Would you?",
        "Roxy: Brennan? Brennan -- isn't that your last name?",
        "Nash: Yes, and it's her first name.",
        "Roxy: What's going on in this town? Must be something in the drinking water. First there was Hugh Hughes, now there's Brennan Brennan. And maybe I should just change my name to Balsom Balsom. Ooh, that'd make a good name for a shampoo.",
        "Nash: Yeah, well, her name is Brennan Buchanan, but we're supposed to be calling her be. Right?",
        "Roxy: Well, since those two got married, shouldn't it be Bree Vega?",
        "Nash: No, it shouldn't.",
        "Roxy: Hey, you know, don't get so snippy. I'm sorry that you're ticked off about a certain couple getting hitched.",
        "Nash: Now, why would I be ticked off?",
        "Roxy: Hey, baby, I'm from a long line of B.S.Ers and I can spot B.S. From a mile away. That's why I don't step in it. You know, I've seen that look when you're around Jessica. It's the same look that Rexy has around Adriana, it's the same way that Natty was about Johnny boy.",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Roxy: It's the same way I get when I'm around Hugh Jackman -- not that I'm around Hugh Jackman, not since the restraining order.",
        "[Roxy laughs]",
        "Roxy: That's a joke!",
        "Nash: Oh --",
        "Roxy: Come on! A joke, remember?",
        "Nash: That's great. Is there a point to this, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Damn straight there's a point.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Roxy: You're still ga-ga in love with Jessica Vega.",

        "Evangeline: Blair, are you ok?",
        "Michael: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.",

        "Michael: Blair, Blair? Blair. Are you with me? Are you with me?",
        "Blair: What happened?",
        "Michael: Oh, well, you just decided to take a little nap for a couple of seconds.",
        "Blair: I fainted?",
        "Michael: You did. Do me a favor -- can you follow my finger? Just with your eyes. Ok. Ok. Now, do you think that you can stand?",
        "Blair: Yeah, yeah, I can.",
        "Michael: Ok. Now, give me your arm.",
        "Blair: Ok.",

        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Michael: Look, I'm going to have Marcie call Todd.",
        "Blair: No, don't. Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So your son's pounding steroids and you had no idea? Are you blind or just really dumb?",
        "Marty: Don't you dare judge me. Patrick died, Todd, and I have been doing my best to be mother and father to Cole. And if that wasn't enough, there was this little incident that happened to me in college that I live with every single day. You know, I never got over it and I never will. So, if you want to know where I've been -- well, I've been living in a nightmare, so you're going to have to forgive me if I missed the signs. Huh.",
        "Todd: If you think I'm going to let Cole off the hook because of what happened between you and me in college, you can forget it.",

        "Spencer: Blair, are you all right?",
        "Michael: Blair, why don't you want me to call Todd?",
        "Spencer: Mike, why don't you get her some water or something?",
        "Blair: Because he's got too much on his plate right now. I don't want to worry him. I --",
        "Spencer: Blair, Blair, look at me. Are you ok?",
        "Blair: Evangeline, please. I don't want to deal with this right now.",
        "Evangeline: Your honor, can we please have a five-minute recess?",
        "Judge: Let's make it 15. This court will adjourn until 3:45.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Thank you. Blair, are you sure you're ok?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I'm fine.",

        "Evangeline: Thank you.",
        "Blair: If I could get some air.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Do you need me to come with you in case --",
        "Michael: No, no, no --",
        "Marcie: You need anything?",
        "Michael: No, you know what? I think I just need to take her outside for a little while, let her calm down. I mean, that seat can be a real pressure cooker, you know?",
        "Marcie: All right. Well, if you need anything, you know, you just let --",
        "Blair: Thank you. Thank you, Marcie.",

        "Rex: Thomas John Mc Bain. Todd Junior Manning -- T.J.M. T.J.M. Oh, and who said god doesn't have a sense of humor?",
        "Adriana: Actually, it would be T.M.J. -- Todd Manning Jr. -- So your conspiracy theory is a bust. Don't worry, ok? We're -- we're going to figure out what to do. What are you doing?",
        "Rex: Oh, where is it? \"What if you found out some important information, but it could hurt another person? Would you tell them or keep it to yourself?\" Help.",
        "Adriana: I know. You're in an awkward position.",
        "Rex: A contortionist is in an awkward position. This one's impossible.",
        "Adriana: You're going to do the right thing.",
        "Rex: Do you remember what my mom said, a little while ago? How it's not easy to know what the right thing is -- \"especially for a Balsom.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So everything you said and did that night was because of roid rage -- is that what you expect me to believe?",
        "Cole: No, I don't, because that's not true. I mean, I lost my temper and I threw things and I grabbed you. And that was because of the steroids and I truly believe that. But I said some really, really mean and horrible things to you and I can't blame anything or anyone else but myself. I mean, I'm not saying that steroids didn't -- didn't make me want sex more -- a lot more. But I tried to force you into it and I called you a tease and that was mean.",
        "Starr: That's really reassuring.",
        "Cole: You know, I'm not a very smart guy, ok? I mean, I listen to guys like Gabe who say things like, \"if you win the game and you don't get laid afterwards, then you're not a winner. You're a loser.\" I mean, I've even said that same thing to other guys.",
        "Starr: Do you believe those things?",
        "Cole: No, of course not.",
        "Starr: Then why would you say them?",
        "Cole: Because I want the -- the guys to think -- think that I was a player? I -- I don't know. Pretty lame, huh?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it is.",
        "Cole: You know, and I bought in to all that crap about the steroids and, I mean, everybody was saying that if you want to make it b, you have to -- you have to do it by stacking. I mean --",
        "Starr: \"Everybody\" meaning Gabe?",
        "Cole: Starr, everybody does it. All -- all those pros juice. I mean --",
        "Starr: But you're only a high school kid. You're just a sophomore.",
        "Cole: Do you know how many times that I hear that everybody on the team is depending on me? I mean, that I have to be stronger and faster and that -- that I can't mess up. Listen, I know what I did was stupid, you know? And -- and when I was doing them, I knew it was the wrong thing to do, but I kept taking them. I wish I could be more like you.",
        "Starr: Me?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I mean, you don't care what anybody else thinks.",
        "Starr: That's not true.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it is. But, no, I wanted to be the big hero. And I wanted to make my mom happy. You know, she -- she's been really depressed ever since my dad died, and even before that. And now that I know that --",
        "Starr: That she was raped?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: By my dad. That's why no matter how mad I am at you, I feel like I should be the one apologizing.",

        "Todd: You want me to tell you how sorry I am for what I did to you? Ok. Sorry, Marty.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
