        "Matthew: [Thinking] My name is Matthew Buchanan, and today is Thanksgiving Day. I wish I had more to be thankful for this year, but I took a punch in the head back in May, and all the lights went out. They came back on for a little while, but it didn't last. And ever since then, spending time with me is about as exciting as watching paint dry.",
        "Nora: Hi, sweetheart. Happy Turkey Day.",
        "Bo: Your mom brought you a feast.",
        "Matthew: [Laughs] She cooked? Seriously? Now, that's a Thanksgiving miracle.",
        "Nora: Okay, it's, um... it's not really a feast. It's, um, turkey sandwiches. I-I didn't have time to get anything else.",
        "Bo: Well, you know, it sounds good to me. As long as we're here with our son, that's all that matters.",
        "Matthew: [Thinking] Where would we be without family today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: 2, 4, 6, 8! Who do we appreciate?!",
        "Bree: Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!",
        "Jessica: Yay!",
        "Ford: Oh, you hear that, Ryder? I've got my own cheering section, and that's the reason why I was in the top 10 today. Gimme five! All right!",
        "Jessica: Congratulations. Now hit the showers.",
        "Ford: Oh, yes, ma'am. Here you go, buddy.",
        "Jessica: Come here.",
        "Ford: Here you go.",
        "Jessica: Aww.",
        "Ford: I'll be right back.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I can't believe Jessica's with Ford now. I remember when Uncle Clint hated that guy so much he tried to fix it so someone else would be Ryder's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sister: I can wait with you, if you want.",
        "Brody: Thanks. It's not my first rodeo. I know the drill.",
        "Matthew: It's got to be rough for Brody being back at St. Anne's. I guess he lost it when he found out Liam wasn't his and tried to run off with the kid.",
        "Sister: Officer Lovett.",
        "Brody: I wasn't sure you'd remember me, sister.",
        "Sister: Of course I remember you. Thank you. We can take it from here.",
        "Brody: [Sighs]",
        "Sister: We're all pulling for you, Brody.",
        "Brody: Thanks for that. Watch your back. [Sighs] Okay, let's do it.",
        "Sister: Just let me fetch my intake forms, and we can get started with the evaluation.",
        "Matthew: Brody's been wanting a family of his own for a really long time. It's the same thing he was trying to hold on to back when he kidnapped Shane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Honey, I am so glad you're here with us today.",
        "Shane: Yeah, me too. [Inhales deeply] It helps with...you know...",
        "Viki: I do know. I do know. I miss your mom so much -- every single day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry, Shane. I wish I could tell you that, just like I wish I could tell you how sorry I am that I didn't stand up for you back when those jerks at school were harassing you. I'm your cousin. I should have had your back. Hey, there's Nigel. Doesn't he get a day off after getting knocked out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Nigel. What's the matter with you? I told you I would set the table. You're supposed to take a load off.",
        "Nigel: I'm perfectly fine.",
        "Roxanne: Mm-hmm, yeah, after Brody practically cold-cocked you? You know, you could have a percussion and not even know about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Is there anybody else like Roxy? She's the bomb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Okay, anybody need any help down here?",
        "Roxanne: Yes, would you please give him orders to stay off his feet?",
        "Clint: Roxy, you're asking the impossible.",
        "[Plates clinking]",
        "Matthew: Hey, Uncle Clint. Sorry you had to spend the holidays under house arrest. But when you flipped out after you lost Mom, you did some bad stuff -- not to me. You were always good to me. You even confessed to a crime I committed. But you and aunt Viki probably aren't thinking about that today.",
        "Viki: Our daughter and our grandson will be here any minute. Boy, do we have a lot to be thankful for today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I guess everyone's in the kitchen.",
        "John: Yeah, hey... you smell that turkey, buddy?",
        "Natalie: Oh, I still can't believe that we're standing here with him right now, when yesterday... I thought we'd lost him forever.",
        "John: But we didn't. And he is safe, and he is healthy. And he's home.",
        "Natalie: Best Thanksgiving ever.",
        "John: Ever.",
        "Matthew: It's going to be one to remember -- that much I can promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: It's from Rachel. [Chuckles] \"I knew you'd be at the hospital today. I hope this makes it a little sweeter, especially after what just happened to Bo.\"",
        "Bo: Wh-- oh!",
        "Nora: [Chuckles]",
        "Bo: Sad but true, bud. Um... the new mayor decided that, uh, she should fire me for not making an arrest in the Victor Lord murder case.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, the new mayor can take that job and shove it.",
        "Bo: [Chuckles] As mad as your mom is right now, you should have seen her yesterday. Look, she opened a can of whoop-ass on Mayor Finn.",
        "Nora: Wh-- now, wait a minute. She hit me first.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you hit her back, and hard!",
        "Nora: Oh, my God.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: What if she ends up like this -- like Matthew did?",
        "Bo: Well, honey, she was fine.",
        "Nora: Well, Matthew thought he was fine at first, too! Brain trauma happens when you least expect it. My God, what happens if she ends up where Matthew is now?",
        "Bo: Wait a minute.",
        "Matthew: Mom has no idea where that is. Neither does Dad. But at least it's peaceful here. Can't say the same about Brody. There's no peace for him right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Barb: Want your football back? I got all the germs off it.",
        "Brody: Keep it.",
        "Barb: Never thought I'd see you back here.",
        "Brody: Didn't think I'd see you either.",
        "Barb: I never left. So, what happened? Did you miss me, or just, did you flip out again?",
        "Brody: Take a guess.",
        "Barb: So, where'd you stash that girlfriend of yours? That one was even crazier than you.",
        "Brody: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Very good, Bree. Good job.",
        "Bree: Why'd you kiss Bobby?",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, um... well, Bobby's your brother's daddy, and we, uh...",
        "Ford: Mm, that looks delicious.",
        "Bree: Are you gonna be my daddy, too?",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. She saw us kissing, so...",
        "Ford: Uh, no -- you know what, Bree? Um... people only really kiss each other when they really like each other. Now, I really like your mom, so, if it's all right with you, I think I'll keep seeing her. Good, 'cause I like you, too.",
        "Jessica: And you know who else we're seeing today? John and Natalie are bringing your little cousin, Liam over to your grandmother's, okay? So I'm gonna take you there, too.",
        "Bree: Are you and aunt Nattie still mad at each other?",
        "Jessica: I... um... you know, why don't we play...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Things between Jessica and Natalie are still kind of tense. When Jessica broke the news that John was Liam's father, Natalie treated her like dirt. But Natalie had her problems, too. She was still into John, even though she was supposed to be marrying Brody. But now that the wedding's off, she still doesn't know if she's got a future with John... or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Fusses]",
        "John: Yep, you might want to brace yourself, little man. It's gonna be a zoo in there when they see you.",
        "Natalie: And I'm not sure if I'm ready for it. My head's still spinning. [Chuckles]",
        "John: It's been a crazy 24 hours.",
        "Natalie: I know. One minute, I'm standing at the altar, ready to marry Brody. The next minute, I figure out you're Liam's father, and then I'm off to the airport trying to stop you before...",
        "John: I took off, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. So, about that, um, travel arrangements -- are you still planning on leaving town for good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I thought our grandson was supposed to be here by now. Is McBain gonna keep us waiting all day?",
        "Viki: Oh, now...",
        "Roxanne: What are you dumping on Johnny for? You got something against the guy?",
        "Clint: I'm not --",
        "Viki: Clint, you know what? I think we should wait for them out in the foyer.",
        "Matthew: Way to go, aunt Viki. Nobody keeps the peace better than you.",
        "Shane: Wait, didn't you say that Dad was in Brazil 'cause he was helping to find Liam?",
        "Roxanne: Yeah. So?",
        "Shane: Well, if Liam's on his way over here, then why isn't Dad?",
        "Matthew: Guess it's your move, Roxy. How are you gonna get out of this one? And how's John gonna get out of this one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: 'Cause, you know, when you said you were moving to Seattle, it's 'cause you want to be closer to your family. Do you still feel that way?",
        "John: Well, I'll tell you, I ain't leaving this guy. And you and I, we have a lot to talk about.",
        "Natalie: So let's talk.",
        "Matthew: Good luck with that. John McBain talks about as much as I do these days.",
        "John: Yeah, I, uh, think...",
        "Viki: Oh, they're home! Oh!",
        "Clint: About time!",
        "Viki: You're back!",
        "Clint: You gave us a scare.",
        "Viki: Oh, thank God. Oh, John, I'm so glad you're safe. Hi, sweetheart. Look at him, as if nothing had happened.",
        "John: I know. He's magic. You want to go to grandma?",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "John: Yeah, there you go. Careful, my sweetheart. My hands are cold. Nothing better than this, is there?",
        "Clint: Whoa, what a shirt you've got. I like that.",
        "Viki: Your tummy's showing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, God. What was I thinking?! Did I learn nothing from what happened to Matthew? [Sighs]",
        "Bo: There's no way I'm gonna talk you down, is there?",
        "Matthew: See, Dad? Told ya.",
        "Nora: Oh, God. What if she's lying in a hospital bed right now like this, or worse?! What if she's collapsed on the floor before anyone's had a chance to take her to a hospital?!",
        "Bo: Red... breathe. Breathe.",
        "Nora: [Breathes deeply]",
        "Bo: Now, listen.",
        "Nora: [Sighs]",
        "Bo: I think I know a way to take care of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Except Mom's not the only one having a bad day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Doesn't Dad want to spend Thanksgiving with us? I mean, if Liam's back, why isn't he?",
        "Roxanne: Hey, sweetie. You know your dad wants to spend turkey day with you, but, well, he couldn't get a plane out. The weather up in Brazil, forget about it.",
        "Shane: Brazil's not up. It's down. And I checked the weather online today. It was fine.",
        "Roxanne: Except for the volcano? I bet you didn't check that.",
        "Shane: The volcano?",
        "Roxanne: Oh, yeah. It's all fire and grim stone, red-hot lather -- no plane is gonna take off in that.",
        "Shane: Whatever.",
        "Roxanne: Done. [Sighs]",
        "Nigel: Forgive me. Lying is not your strong suit.",
        "Roxanne: Well, excuse me. What was I supposed to say? That Rex going to Brazil had nothing to do with Liam, which, by the way, it didn't?!",
        "Nigel: Then why would he go all the way to South America?",
        "Roxanne: This is the crazy thing. Rex thought he saw Gigi getting on a plane to Rio.",
        "Nigel: I don't understand. Miss Morasco is deceased. Her heart belongs to Mr. Buchanan now.",
        "Roxanne: Well, what can I tell ya? I think Rex is going all \"ghost\" on us.",
        "Matthew: That's what you think. But from where I'm standing, things look pretty different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Congratulations on being the father of a damn fine boy.",
        "John: He is damn fine. [Laughter] Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: It doesn't matter whose heart's in there. It's a lot bigger and better than the old one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hm. Mom, uh...",
        "Viki: Yes?",
        "Natalie: How's Nigel?",
        "Viki: Nigel's actually fine, insisting on overseeing all the preparations today, despite how many people are telling him not to.",
        "Natalie: Of course.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: And have you heard from Jessica?",
        "Viki: No. I don't know if she's coming today.",
        "Natalie: If she doesn't, that's... it's on me. I really sh--",
        "Bree: Did Liam come home yet?",
        "Both: Hi!",
        "Viki: He's right up there. Go say \"hi.\"",
        "Natalie: I want a hug for aunt Nattie! How are you, honey? Did your mama come with you?",
        "Viki: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Don't talk about Jessica. She's fine now.",
        "Barb: Wasn't so fine a few months ago. They had to put her down in 2 East -- the room with the padded walls.",
        "Brody: I know.",
        "Barb: [Chuckles] That's how whacked out she was.",
        "Brody: She had good reason.",
        "Barb: How would you know? You never showed up. When she finally busted out, it was with some guy named Robert Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Uh, we're all really glad that, uh, Liam's okay. I'm gonna get this cake to the kitchen.",
        "Natalie: Jess, wait! Um... can we talk for a minute?",
        "Viki: Well, that's a very good idea. You know what? I'll take that.",
        "Jessica: Uh, uh...",
        "Viki: And, um... John, would you mind, uh -- let's take Liam in the kitchen. Roxy and Nigel would love to see him. Bree, come with me, honey. All right? And, uh, Robert, would you mind if we borrowed Ryder for a minute?",
        "Ford: Oh, sure.",
        "Viki: Clint?",
        "Clint: Ahh.",
        "Ford: Go see Papa.",
        "Viki: Yeah, let's all go to the kitchen and see Roxy and Nigel! The more the merrier, huh?!",
        "Matthew: They should hire Aunt Viki to be a negotiator at the U.N.",
        "Clint: Come on, young man. Let's go in the kitchen.",
        "Ford: Jess, do you want me to go, too?",
        "Jessica: No, no. There's nothing that we're gonna say that I don't want you to hear.",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] I really want to say that, um... I'm sorry. All you wanted to do is -- is let me know t-the truth, and I chose to believe that you wanted to hurt me.",
        "Jessica: You thought I was lying.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, and I said some things that, uh, no sister should ever say. I have to ask. Can -- can you find a way to forgive me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hello, Mayor Finn. How are you doing? No, I didn't call to apologize! I-I'm calling to urge you to seek medical attention -- a CAT scanner, maybe. Because you might be more seriously injured than you originally thought, and it's my job you make sure you check yourself out with the doctor. So call one, okay? And for the record, go to hell for firing my husband!",
        "Bo: [Breathes deeply] You feel better?",
        "Nora: Yeah, I do.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I can't believe that you'd think that I would make up some story just to ruin your wedding.",
        "Natalie: I am so sorry. It's just that when you didn't have any proof that John was Liam's father...",
        "Matthew: You got to admit, Jess. That story was pretty hard to believe. Especially the part about Tina's dog.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and then it turns out the dog really did have the paternity test, and then Tina shows up at the wedding and tells everyone. And that's when Brody finally admitted, and that's when I found out that he'd been hiding the truth.",
        "Jessica: Brody was the big reason why I waited so long to say anything. I-I was afraid that it would destroy him if he found out that Liam wasn't his son.",
        "Natalie: Well, it turns out he's known for months.",
        "Jessica: I can't believe it. And then to take Liam and run...",
        "Natalie: I know. I just feel like maybe he snapped, you know, like when he thought he was gonna lose Shane.",
        "Jessica: So, what happened? How did you finally get Liam back?",
        "Natalie: He just...gave up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Uncle Clint just put one grandkid down for a nap. Now he's got to deal with the grandkid who needs him most of all.",
        "Clint: Hey, Shane. Is something bothering you, kiddo?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Clint: You sure? It kind of looks like there is.",
        "Shane: It's just Roxy.",
        "Clint: Roxy? What about her?",
        "Shane: She lied to me. She told me that my dad went to Brazil to help find Liam, and she keeps trying to tell me that. But the last time that my dad went on a trip, it was because of my mom -- because he wanted to find her or something.",
        "Clint: Oh, and you think the same thing is happening this time?",
        "Shane: Yeah. It's like he can't let her go or something.",
        "Clint: Well, Shane, we Buchanans are stubborn. And sometimes that's a good thing. Other times, it's not.",
        "Matthew: You can say that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: When John and I found him, I think he knew it was over.",
        "Jessica: And -- and where is he now? Is he in jail?",
        "Natalie: No, um... I can't file any charges -- not until he's had a full psychological evaluation. So right now, he's -- he's at St. Anne's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You see, when you love someone as much as Rex loved your mother and you lose them, take it from me -- you can go a little crazy and you want to hold onto anything and everything that'll keep that person alive.",
        "Shane: So, what? Is he gonna do this forever?",
        "Clint: Well, all I can tell you is grief is a process, and you kind of have to find your way through it. But, yes, eventually we do come out the other side.",
        "Shane: I hope so. I miss her, too. A lot.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I know you do. See, you two are trying to find your way through this. But your drawing -- I bet that helps.",
        "Shane: You know about my drawing?",
        "Clint: Yeah, of course I do. You think I haven't been paying attention?",
        "Shane: Since when?",
        "Matthew: No joke. You didn't even acknowledge Shane was your grandson for, like, a year!",
        "Clint: Yeah, I had that coming. Shane, I think it's time that I tell you how sorry I am.",
        "Shane: You don't have to.",
        "Clint: That's where you're wrong. Now, these days, I have to do things differently. That's part of having a new heart -- that is, if you got a good one. And your mother's just as good as they get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: So, speaking of apologies, looks like Jessica hasn't totally accepted Natalie's.",
        "Ford: Hey. You okay?",
        "Jessica: [Voice breaking] Um...no.",
        "Ford: Listen, for what it's worth, I think that Natalie's really sorry.",
        "Jessica: [Smacks lips] Well, Brody's the one that I'm worried about. You know, I knew that he would be destroyed when he found out that Liam wasn't his son, but oh, my God. He's back in St. Anne's. That's where we met -- three years ago on Thanksgiving.",
        "Ford: [Inhales sharply] Not exactly the best holiday atmosphere.",
        "Jessica: And they try, you know. There's the dinner and decorations, but somehow it just makes it worse.",
        "Ford: Hey, Jess. If you want to go see him, it's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Nigel. I meant to ask you -- how are you feeling after that crack in the head?",
        "Nigel: Oh, my head is in much better shape than my conscience. How I could have allowed officer Lovett to abscond with this child...",
        "Roxanne: Nigel, you did the best that you could.",
        "John: Yeah, don't do that to yourself. You're a champ.",
        "Nigel: You're most... gracious. Excuse me, I...need to make sure the table is in order.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Matthew: Uh-oh. John's alone with Roxy? How long before she starts in on him about Natalie?",
        "Roxanne: You see that kid?",
        "John: Yeah, I see him, Rox.",
        "Roxanne: He's just the spitting image of his old dad. And look at the way that he's looking at you. It's like...you hung the moon, the stars, and the whole enchilada. He knows his daddy when he sees him.",
        "Matthew: Wait. Is she really not gonna say anything about Natalie?",
        "Roxanne: I was, uh, just wondering how Nattie looked when you said those three little words.",
        "John: What words?",
        "Matthew: Seriously, John? You're pretending you don't know what she's talking about?",
        "Roxanne: You know, when you told her that you loved her? That you never stopped and you should have told her sooner?",
        "John: I'm pretty sure that's more than three words, Rox.",
        "Roxanne: Well, who cares?! What did she do after you said that you loved her?",
        "John: I didn't. I didn't tell her.",
        "Roxanne: Well, are you gonna?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: [Clears throat]",
        "Viki: Did you and Jessica straighten things out?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean, I tried really hard to apologize, and then Jess got really upset when she found out Brody is at St. Anne's.",
        "Viki: It's going to take time, sweetheart, but she will come around.",
        "Matthew: You got to love Aunt Viki's faith, right?",
        "Natalie: It just feels like everything is so up in the air, you know? Not just with Jess -- with John, too, you know? I-I still don't even know where we stand.",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart.",
        "Matthew: And she might never know. Or maybe it's just that I might never know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: You went searching for your baby together and you never thought to say to her, \"hey, baby, I am crazy about you\"? What is your problem?!",
        "John: You know, Roxy, we were kind of focused on finding Liam, not so much on ourselves.",
        "Roxanne: Well, then you've got to change your focus, because Liam is back. So what are you waiting for?",
        "John: It's not that simple.",
        "Roxanne: The hell it's not. No more excuses anymore. Nothing to stand in your way. So march. Tell her. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Barb: Who are you gonna eat with?",
        "Brody: No one. I'm going to eat alone.",
        "Barb: You can run, but you can't hide -- now that little blond girlfriend isn't around to play watchdog!",
        "Jessica: I wouldn't be so sure of that. And...I wouldn't stand so close to Brody -- not after his diagnosis.",
        "Barb: Diagnosis?",
        "Jessica: He has stigmatiliosis. It's very contagious, and -- I-I'm sure you've already had it, though, right?",
        "Barb: No!",
        "Jessica: Well, the strain is... was it something I said?",
        "Brody: [Laughs] Did you really just do that... again?",
        "Jessica: You remembered.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I did. What are you -- what are you doing here? Is something wrong with Liam? Is he okay?",
        "Jessica: He's fine. He's at Llanfair with... everyone.",
        "Brody: Oh. How about Nigel?",
        "Jessica: He's great, too.",
        "Brody: So, what are you -- why aren't you home with them?",
        "Jessica: 'Cause I heard that you were here, and I thought about Thanksgiving three years ago.",
        "Brody: Me too.",
        "Jessica: You were scared and alone, and I was pretending not to be scared, but I was way more scared than you were. And nobody deserves to feel like that -- not today. So I had to come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: My cousin Jessica's amazing. Meanwhile, Dad's trying not to tell my brother, David, that he lost his job. The last thing he wants is David telling Dorian, the senator, and getting her to pull some strings.",
        "Bo: Okay, well [Coughs] Happy Thanksgiving to you, too. Look, David, I want you to be sure -- what? No, everything's fine here. Why wouldn't it be?",
        "Matthew: Distract him, Dad! Ask him if he wants to talk to me!",
        "Bo: Hey, you want to say \"Hi\" to Matthew?",
        "Matthew: Yes! Let me hear David's voice again!",
        "Bo: You know what? Nora and I will never forget that Matthew was with you when he woke up.",
        "Matthew: Wouldn't it be awesome if that happened again today?",
        "Bo: Hey, well, it's worth a try.",
        "Matthew: Happy Thanksgiving, David. Don't you wish we could give them something really big to be thankful for?",
        "Bo: Hey, David? Look, I'm sorry, but Matthew's not responding.",
        "Matthew: Good thing the phone wasn't on speaker. My big brother just told me some big news. But he swore me to secrecy, so I can't say anything.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: I'll take that one to my grave.",
        "Bo: Yeah, thanks -- thanks for trying, at least. And, uh... yeah, and I miss you, too. All right. Bye-bye. [Sighs] You okay?",
        "Nora: Yeah, it's just with the holidays and everything, I just -- [Voice breaking] I couldn't stop myself from hoping.",
        "Bo: Honey, the day's not over yet.",
        "Matthew: No, it's not -- not by a long shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: I am not taking \"no\" for an answer.",
        "John: Knock it off, Roxy.",
        "Roxanne: You go to Natalie, and you tell her what she's been waiting to hear for so long.",
        "John: And then what? \"Pass the gravy, please?\"",
        "Roxanne: Or maybe the potatoes. Whatever you want.",
        "John: Hey, this is not something you do between courses, all right? It's like I told you. It's not that simple.",
        "Roxanne: Hey! Hey! [Sighs]",
        "Natalie: Ever since he found out that Liam was his, he hasn't even said anything about the two of us.",
        "Viki: Darling [Chuckles] He had barely had time to absorb this, and neither have you. I think you both have to give yourselves a chance to adjust to this new reality, huh?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: I think right now for all of us we should stop being so afraid of what we don't have and be grateful for what we do have, because, boy, have we got a lot.",
        "Natalie: [Chuckles]",
        "Viki: Okay? All right, now. I have to go round up people for dinner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I just didn't do right by you or your dad, and I regret that more than you will ever know. Rex is my son, you're my grandson, and me, I'm the fool that waited too long to count his blessings. But you and your father are gifts in my life that I just don't deserve. But I'm gonna try and do better, and I'm gonna try to be worthy of you, your dad, and this wonderful heart that once belonged to your mom. I know I got a heck of a long way to go, so I'm asking you for your patience.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Trust him, Shane. He'll come through for you. Look what he did for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey! Who's ready for turkey and stuffing?",
        "Clint: Oh, we are. And Shane gets first dibs on a drumstick.",
        "Viki: Whoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Whoa, the drumstick's uncle Clint's favorite. You better pray that nobody else he owes wants the other one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Ah! There you are. Is Jessie not with you?",
        "Ford: Um, no, she went to, uh, to St. Anne's to see Brody.",
        "Viki: I would expect nothing less of her.",
        "Ford: That's what I said, too.",
        "Viki: Robert, I am really very glad that you decided to stay and have Thanksgiving with your son, and with us.",
        "Ford: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Brody, you didn't lose one child. You lost two. First Ryder, then Liam, and that would drive even the strongest person over the edge.",
        "Brody: You don't have to do this.",
        "Jessica: Hey, hey. Look at me. You have been my rock for so long. Whenever I felt like I was floating away, you were always there to bring me back down to the ground. You were a good man, and you still are.",
        "Brody: How can you say that?",
        "Jessica: Because it's the truth. You are smart and strong and kind. And you're gonna get through this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Well, if that's all...",
        "Viki: Oh, no, Nigel. Please don't leave. Please stay.",
        "Clint: Viki's house, Viki's rules, Nigel. After what you did for us, you are not serving us. We're serving you.",
        "Natalie: \"Yeah, Nigel! Please stay!\"",
        "[Laughter]",
        "John: Yeah, stick around, Nigel.",
        "Nigel: I'd be delighted.",
        "Viki: Good. Thank you. Oh, my, my, my, my, my. We have a great deal to be thankful for today. To start with, how lucky are we that Liam is home safe and sound with his mother and his father?",
        "Natalie: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: John, welcome. And welcome to the family.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Nigel! We owe you so much. You risked your own safety for us. Thank you so very much. And we are very lucky that Ryder's here with us today having his very first Thanksgiving with us, and so is Liam. And his father is here. Thank you, Robert, and welcome.",
        "Ford: Thank you.",
        "Viki: And Bree! So glad you're here! Shane, it's wonderful that you're here with us -- really, it is. The newest member of our family. Roxy! What can I say?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Roxanne: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: Thank you. Thank you for your spirit and your caring. I am delighted you're here. Obviously there are some people who should be here but...are not. My late brother, Victor, and I miss him. I'm very grateful Todd is back with us, although he's supposed to be here with us today and I have no idea where he is.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: I miss Tina and Cord. I'm very glad they found their way back to each other, and I wish they were here. But they're happy. And, of course, we miss Kevin and Joey and Clint's son, Rex. And there's one person who should be here, but she's not. And that's Gigi. Gigi gave us her heart, and that has brought new life to this family. Thank you, Gigi. So, I think we should all just be very, very grateful for the love that we have -- for the love we have for each other, for the love that is in this room -- spoken and unspoken.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.",
        "John: Yay, Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Shane: Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Clint: Well said. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "John: Cheers. Cheers.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Clint: Cheers.",

        "Bo: Here's to family -- Rachel and David.",
        "Nora: Yes, and to our ever-growing family.",
        "Bo: Yes. And here's to Matthew. And as long as he's alive and breathing, we've still got hope that he's gonna come back to us.",
        "Nora: I think that's what I'm most thankful for. I'm thankful for Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: But do you have any idea how grateful I am to you? God, I wish you could hear me. You know what I wish?",
        "Ryder: Dada.",
        "Matthew: I wish I had a chance to tell Robert Ford and his brothers how sorry I am. I never meant to take their dad's life.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ford: Oh, don't go anywhere. Hang on. Hang on. Don't go anywhere.",
        "Matthew: And you know what else I wish? That I could stick around to see what happens with these guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Remember when I drew this?",
        "Brody: [Chuckles] Yeah, I do. You turned me into a superhero.",
        "Shane: I thought you might want to have it with you while you're in here.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I would, Shane. [Voice breaking] I can't tell you how much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Brody's lucky. He'll have a chance to make up for what he did. Uncle Clint's getting that chance, too. But not me. I blew it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Oh, just going up to check on Master Liam, but I'll be right back, so don't you dare lift a finger where these dishes are concerned!",
        "Clint: We won't. We'll show Nigel a thing or two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: But Thanksgiving's not Thanksgiving without the wishbone.",

        "Viki: Look.",
        "Clint: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I don't know who scored that wish, but I don't think it matters. Too bad Natalie didn't find one of those. We all know what she would have wished for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I didn't think I'd ever have a chance to do that again -- watch my little boy fall asleep.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and he usually doesn't drop off that fast. But I guess now that he's got his daddy, all is right in the world.",
        "John: I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to talk before. I think now's the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I don't know if you can hear us, but you have to know how much we love you.",
        "Bo: We always have, and we always will, son. We'll see you soon.",
        "Matthew: Mom and Dad with their arms around each other -- that's my happy ending right there. My name is Matthew Buchanan, and today is Thanksgiving Day. It was a day of gratitude, of joy, and hope, and wishes -- lots of wishes. But in the end... it was also the day I died.",
