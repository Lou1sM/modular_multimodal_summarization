        "Dorian is determined to find out who voted against her when Viki beat her by only 1 vote in the election. When Markko admits that he voted for Viki, at first she is furious. But Langston and Markko convince her to forget about the election and to be with David in London. Meanwhile, Viki announces that she cannot serve as mayor because of all she has going on with her family, regarding the death of Jared and Mitch Laurence and all. Rex talks to Bo about finding out that Mitch is his bio dad. Stacy and Kim persuade Schuyler not to tell Gigi that he might be the father of Stacy's baby, realizing that it could ruin his \"chances\" with Gigi. Gigi admits to Noelle that she may have feelings for Schuyler."

        "Bo: Listen, I want Mitch Laurence to pay for Jared's murder. Now, if you guys can't make the case, then give it to us. You know, we'll get it done. All right. Okay, I'll be in touch. Hey.",
        "Rex: Hey.",
        "Bo: I heard about Michigan. Did you see a doctor?",
        "Rex: I'm okay. Natalie's--",
        "Bo: Yeah, I know. Did you see her?",
        "Rex: I just came from her. She's staying at John's tonight.",
        "Bo: Good. 'Cause if anybody knows what she's feeling right now, it's him. I cannot believe that this Mitch Laurence is still alive.",
        "Rex: Try this--Mitch Laurence is my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Clint, Natalie's not in her room.",
        "Clint: Oh, it's okay. John McBain called me. She's with him.",
        "Viki: Oh, dear.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Did Jessie get back?",
        "Clint: Yeah. She's upstairs with Brody. They decided to leave Bree over at Renee's until tomorrow morning. How's Charlie doing?",
        "Viki: He's asleep, finally. I'm gonna go get Natalie.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, now, wait a minute. You don't want to go outside.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "Clint: 'Cause there's some reporters out there. I shooed 'em away from the front door, but that's not gonna hold for long.",
        "Viki: Boy, bad news travels fast. What do they want, a statement about Jared and Mitch Laurence, right?",
        "Clint: That and the fact that you are the newly elected mayor of Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What's that?",
        "Markko: Candied yams.",
        "Langston: Oh. Dorian hates vegetables that taste like dessert.",
        "Markko: Here we go again. We're at war. Pick a side.",
        "Langston: What are you talking about?",
        "Markko: What's with her? Is everything really that black and white? You can't be for more than one thing at once?",
        "Langston: You don't have to feel guilty.",
        "Markko: About what?",
        "Langston: You did not cost Dorian the election.",
        "Markko: Really? She lost by one vote.",
        "Langston: That means thousands of people didn't vote for her.",
        "Markko: Yeah, but only one of them is in her kitchen messing with her vegetables. Dorian is gonna find out that I voted for Viki Banks, and when she does, she'll do to me what I did to the sweet potatoes.",
        "Langston: Not if you keep your mouth shut.",
        "Markko: She's going door to door looking for people who betrayed her. That's her word-- \"betrayed.\"",
        "Langston: She is not going door to door. She took her clipboard down to the Buenos Dias.",

        "[Single brief applause]",
        "Dorian: Thank you very much for agreeing to participate in this all-important, crucial post-election analysis.",
        "Moe: We volunteered?",
        "Dorian: I intend to run a far more effective campaign next time, and therefore, I want to know who you voted for and why.",
        "Moe: Horse hockey.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me.",
        "Noelle: You don't want information.",
        "Carlotta: She wants somebody to blame. You lost, Dorian. Live with it.",

        "Shane: Hey, Mom, lemon chess. Noelle must have made it just for us.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Shane: Your favorite pie that nobody else makes? It's here.",
        "Gigi: That's great. You keep your eye on it. I have to make a quick call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Pay attention, Schuy. This doesn't have to be the end of the world for anyone.",
        "Schuyler: Meaning what?",
        "Kim: Meaning we'd all be a lot happier if you never told a soul about the one- night stand. Just forget it ever happened.",
        "Schuyler: So it's--I'm having a child.",
        "Stacy: Um, excuse me. No. I'm the one with the bump.",
        "Schuyler: Fine. You're pregnant with my child, and I can't tell, and you think I'm gonna go along with that. Why on earth would I go along with that?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Schuyler: Hi.",
        "Gigi: What's the word? Is Stacy gonna drop the little bomb?",
        "Schuyler: We're negotiating.",
        "Gigi: Don't tell me she's listening to reason. She knows Roxy saw me coming out of your room. She doesn't care that nothing happened.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, that's true.",
        "Gigi: So what are you negotiating?",
        "Schuyler: She wants something.",
        "Gigi: Good Lord, she's pregnant with Rex's baby. What more could she want?",
        "Stacy: Okay, so now Schuyler's the father?",
        "Kim: There's no leverage in telling him it was really Oliver Fish.",
        "Stacy: Leverage?",
        "Kim: Trust me, we'll work it.",
        "Schuyler: I'll call you back as soon as I can.",
        "Stacy: How's Gigi?",
        "Schuyler: Who says that was Gigi?",
        "Both: The look on your face.",
        "Kim: It's pretty clear you love that girl. Don't you want a chance with her?",
        "Schuyler: Not like this.",
        "Stacy: Oh, come on, Schuyler, you know you'd do anything in your power to get Gigi away from Rex.",
        "Schuyler: No, no. Because I'm not like you.",
        "Kim: You sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You can't leave with him.",
        "Dani: Who do you think you are butting into our lives?",
        "Todd: Well, I'm not who you think I--",
        "Dani: I don't care who you are! If you ever try to hurt my mom or keep me away from my dad again, I swear--",
        "Todd: Ross is not your dad.",
        "Dani: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Todd: Ross is not your dad, I am.",
        "Dani: Look, whatever's going on with you and my mom, it doesn't give you the right to start bossing me around and telling me what to do.",
        "Todd: No, no, that's not what I meant.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd--",
        "Dani: I have a dad, and we're leaving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Dorian's out for blood.",
        "Langston: I wouldn't say that.",
        "Markko: I would.",
        "Langston: She's collecting data.",
        "Markko: Yeah, on who's loyal and who isn't. I'm a dead man.",
        "Langston: This isn't the only thing on her mind.",
        "Markko: One vote. You know, she's not gonna sleep until she figures out who betrayed her. And yeah, she's real good at losing.",
        "Langston: Okay, she just needs to blow off some steam, get it out of her system, and then she'll see. Just because she lost by one vote, doesn't mean she can blame one person. That's crazy.",
        "Markko: That's Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm a Cramer woman. We can handle a setback.",
        "Carlotta: Defeat, Dorian. You were defeated.",
        "Dorian: You know, it is precisely that defeatist attitude that has kept you in an apron and crepe-soled shoes.",
        "Carlotta: You seem to have forgotten, Dorian, that I do not work for you anymore.",
        "Dorian: And does that mean I am no longer owed any loyalty? You used to work for me, Carlotta. I practically raised--",
        "Carlotta: Raised my children. I know.",
        "Dorian: You saw the way I ran my house.",
        "Carlotta: Yes, I did, indeed.",
        "Dorian: And that gave you an indication as to how I would run this city.",
        "Carlotta: Exactly. That's why I voted for Viki.",
        "Dorian: Ingrate! Just a moment. Please. Moe, Noelle, I would still like to know who it was--",
        "Moe: You can't ask people how they voted. It's a secret ballot between them and their conscience. And it's un-American. And it's unconstitutional to even ask.",
        "Dorian: Et tu, mon ami?",
        "Moe: I will not confirm or deny for whom I decided to cast my vote.",
        "Dorian: I gave you my house.",
        "Moe: You took it back!",
        "Dorian: You lived there for several months! And I let Noelle keep that gorgeous lingerie. I'm sure you've had occasion to enjoy it.",
        "Noelle: All right, now hush your mouth. Now stop this foolishness right now. It is almost Thanksgiving, and you should be counting your blessings, not trying to--",
        "Dorian: Instead of trying to hunt down the one turncoat ingrate who cost me this election?",
        "Noelle: Exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Congratulations, Madam Mayor.",
        "Viki: So I won.",
        "Clint: By one vote. There was a recount, but that's over, and the election stands.",
        "Viki: Boy, the election seems a lifetime ago.",
        "Clint: Want me to get rid of the reporters?",
        "Viki: No. No, I'm going to make a statement.",
        "Clint: Well, you know, you can make a written statement and just wait until after Jared's funeral to face 'em head on.",
        "Viki: It's all right. I'm gonna get this over with.",
        "Clint: All right. I'll have your back.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Balsom, if that's a joke, it's a bad one.",
        "Rex: I wish.",
        "Bo: What makes you think Mitch Laurence is your father?",
        "Rex: My birth certificate. My Aunt Corrine showed it to me.",
        "Bo: Your Aunt? Is this before or after she drugged you? That woman was working you, Balsom. That certificate could have been a forgery.",
        "Rex: Roxy confirmed it.",
        "Bo: You believe her?",
        "Rex: I don't know. She always told me that he was the devil, and that's why she was afraid of him, why she wouldn't tell me. By all reports, that's Mitch.",
        "Bo: Oh, Balsom...you okay?",
        "Rex: I'm just worried about Natalie.",
        "Bo: Well, we'll keep an eye on her.",
        "Rex: It's--it is what it is. It explains a lot.",
        "Bo: About what?",
        "Rex: I don't know...Roxy, my life, me.",
        "Bo: Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Rex: It's okay. I always knew that it had to be bad because of the way Roxy didn't tell me about it for years. But usually Roxy, bad--it just means too honest or sober. I don't know, part of me hoped--",
        "Bo: Hoped what?",
        "Rex: That my father could turn out to be somebody like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Hey, what's this?",
        "Kyle: It's dinner. I remembered you were working late.",
        "Oliver: Thanks.",
        "Officer: Your boyfriend brought you dinner?",
        "Oliver: Uh, yeah. I have a boyfriend. You got a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I have a conscience. And a baby. Oh, my God.",
        "Stacy: Wait. You don't think that I have a conscience?",
        "Schuyler: Do you want to go over the last year with me? Let's start with the fact that you went after your sister's boyfriend while her son had leukemia.",
        "Stacy: I love Rex. He belongs with me.",
        "Schuyler: You know what? He doesn't love you, Stacy, and he never will.",
        "Stacy: Well, you know what? He made love to me, so he'll obviously get there. We just need help.",
        "Kim: Just like you and Gigi need help.",
        "Schuyler: Whoa! No. No. I'm sorry. That's not the same thing.",
        "Kim: Just think, Schuyler. I mean, what are the chances? Stacy loses the baby, her last shot to be with Rex, and then you're there needing comfort. And you two replaced that kid, and now because of that, you can be with Gigi.",
        "Schuyler: Is this like the circle of life in your mind?",
        "Kim: It's perfect.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, except for the fact that Rex and Gigi love each other and the only problem is that Stacy's pregnant, so when I tell I the truth--",
        "Kim: Then everything will be good with the lovebirds. Gigi won't be calling you to cry on your shoulder anymore.",
        "Stacy: Kimmie's right. They'll end up getting married.",
        "Kim: And move away, get a fresh start.",
        "Stacy: You'll never see Gigi ever again.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I can live with that.",
        "Both: How?",
        "Schuyler: Stacy, you and I are gonna have a baby to raise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Come on, Dad.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, you're not--",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, stop.",
        "Dani: Get out of our way!",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella, I need to speak to you alone.",
        "Dani: Forget it!",
        "T\u00e9a: Now!",
        "Dani: All you ever do is lie to me!",
        "T\u00e9a: No, mijita, I'm not gonna lie to you. I swear. This time I am going to tell you the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How's it going?",
        "Dorian: Abysmally. This post-election investigation has been nothing but bad news. What is this?",
        "Langston: Candied yams.",
        "Dorian: Mmm. The name tells the whole sad story.",
        "Langston: I know, but--",
        "Markko: Look, it's my fault, Dr. Lord.",
        "Langston: Markko made them. They're his papi's favorite.",
        "Dorian: Is this true?",
        "Markko: Uh, yes.",
        "Langston: Yeah. Remember, we're taking Thanksgiving dinner down to the homeless shelter on Market Street tomorrow?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes, yes, yes, that's right. Um, however, would you mind very much kind of making that disappear, hide it away?",
        "Markko: Sure.",
        "Langston: So you're really upset about the election, huh?",
        "Dorian: Yes. I made promises to people. They trusted me, and I feel like I let them down.",
        "Markko: Dr. Lord, I need to tell you something.",
        "Langston: Markko...",
        "Markko: I've got to get it off my chest.",
        "Langston: Don't say it!",
        "Dorian: Yes, say it. Say it. Believe me, I can handle it.",
        "Markko: Really?",
        "Dorian: Yes. This is about your parents' reaction to it?",
        "Markko: Well, I think they can take it.",
        "Dorian: Really? I mean, it is one thing to support alternative lifestyle in theory. It's quite another--",
        "Markko: I didn't--I didn't vote for you, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Markko: It's my fault you lost the election.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reporter: Did you know Mitch Laurence was still alive?",
        "Second Reporter: When did Jared Banks get involved with him?",
        "First Reporter: Isn't Mitch Laurence your daughter Jessica's father?",
        "Viki: I'm not going to take questions.",
        "Reporter: Mrs. Banks, that's hardly fair to the citizens of Llanview.",
        "Second Reporter: Isn't it true Jared Banks murdered two people?",
        "Viki: No, that is not true.",
        "Reporter: How is your husband taking the news about his son?",
        "Clint: All right, now let her talk, or we'll end this and you won't get anything.",
        "Viki: Thank you. I would like to make a statement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You are nothing like Mitch Laurence.",
        "Rex: That's what Gigi said.",
        "Bo: Smart woman. You listen to her.",
        "Rex: I'm lucky to have her.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: You know what she did when I told her?",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Rex: She gave me a sonogram of Stacy's baby. Told me to think about the kid, not the past.",
        "Bo: How'd she get a sonogram of Stacy's baby?",
        "Rex: Stacy gave it to her.",
        "Bo: Oh, fine.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know, but Gigi gave it to me like it was the greatest thing in the world. I've always been keeping the idea that this baby is mine at arm's length, but when Gigi did that, it just...changed everything.",
        "Bo: You got a new baby coming. Balsom, you are a good man and a good dad.",
        "Rex: I have a pretty good teacher.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Well, hey! I thought I'd see you two in here before Turkey Day. Now, what kind of pie would you like?",
        "Shane: Mom's on Mars today.",
        "Gigi: Oh, I'm sorry. What? Are we on pie?",
        "Noelle: I made lemon chest.",
        "Shane: I knew that was for us. It's the only pie I like.",
        "Noelle: Oh, it's already got your name on it. Unless you want something different.",
        "Moe: Hey, Shane, can you help me in the kitchen? We're gutting pumpkins.",
        "Shane: Cool!",
        "Noelle: Girl, you need to snap out of it. What's going on?",
        "Gigi: I feel like dirt.",
        "Noelle: Everybody has a bad day now and then. So you got drunk. You didn't drive or do anything else you'd regret, did you?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Noelle: And Rex didn't find out you spent the night at Schuyler's?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Noelle: But you're feeling guilty. Honey, I got to ask you--do you have a thing for Schuyler Joplin?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Uh, no, no, no. No, we are not raising a baby together.",
        "Schuyler: This is my baby, yes?",
        "Stacy: Yes.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so it's my child, too. I have rights.",
        "Stacy: Do you even want a child?",
        "Schuyler: Not exactly. It wasn't the plan. But, hey, you know what?",
        "Kim: Don't let it mess up your life then. You don't want to be tied to Stacy forever.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, neither did Rex, and you don't seem to have a problem with that.",
        "Kim: If you claim this kid, then Gigi knows you slept with Stacy.",
        "Schuyler: Yep.",
        "Kim: She'll hate you.",
        "Schuyler: I don't think so.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, she will.",
        "Kim: She'll lose all respect for you.",
        "Schuyler: How far along are you?",
        "Kim: Schuy, we're giving you an out here. It's not in your best interest to speak up.",
        "Schuyler: So I--I keep your secret, but it's really to my benefit? How stupid do you think I am?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Do you remember what the truth sounds like, Mom?",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella, do you remember what we spoke about this morning?",
        "Dani: Oh, that? You'll love this. You're a dangerously angry, violent man. Did you know that?",
        "Ross: You know that's not true.",
        "Dani: No kidding.",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella, you know that it is true.",
        "Dani: You would say anything.",
        "Todd: It is true, Daniela.",
        "Dani: Who asked you? You just believe what Mom says!",
        "Todd: Look at that. Look at her neck.",
        "Dani: What? You did that.",
        "Todd: Well, that's what he wants you to believe, but no, I--",
        "Dani: Because it's true! Mom!",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, tell her what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Nobody thinks you're stupid, Schuyler. Right, Stace?",
        "Stacy: Right.",
        "Schuyler: You want me to lie to Gigi. You want me to deny my own child.",
        "Stacy: Oh, would you stop saying that?",
        "Kim: Don't lie. Just forget you ever heard it.",
        "Schuyler: Wow. Wow. Okay, you know what? Let's forget about how wrong this is for a second. How are you gonna pull this off, guys? What are you gonna do when the baby's born and it looks just like me?",
        "Stacy: Well, you and Rex sort of, you know, look alike.",
        "Kim: Totally.",
        "Schuyler: What? What? We are nothing alike. This is not gonna work.",
        "Kim: It already has.",
        "Stacy: Everyone's buying it.",
        "Schuyler: Un-uh. Everyone is dealing with the fact that you're pregnant, but the minute this baby is born, Rex is gonna get a paternity test, and then he's gonna know he's not the father, and the question on everyone's mind will be, who is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Wait a minute.",
        "Oliver: No, no. You wait a minute, okay? You saw me come out on TV and you don't like it? Too bad. I'm gay, end of story. Now, why don't you say what you were gonna say.",
        "Officer: There's some soda in the break room if you want some.",

        "Viki: My son-in-law, Jared Banks, was a very, very good man. And the police have now discovered he did not kill anyone. He didn't kill Wayne Landers or Pamela Stuart. They were both murdered by Mitch Laurence. And Mr. Laurence is now under arrest in California, and he will be made to answer for these crimes, as well as for the murder of my son-in-law. Now, I have only one comment to make about Mitch Laurence and my family. My daughter Jessica considers Clint Buchanan to be her father. He raised her, and she loves him dearly. So Mitch Laurence has no place, no place in our lives. Oh, okay. And finally, heard there was an election in town. How'd that go?",
        "[Laughter]",

        "Markko: I'm sorry, but I just--I honestly thought about the job--",
        "Dorian: Do you know what you cost me? What you cost this community?",
        "Langston: Okay, Dorian, that is not fair. Markko isn't the only person who didn't vote for you. You can't blame this on him.",
        "Dorian: One vote!",
        "Langston: Okay, yes, that's how close you came. That's huge!",
        "Dorian: Yes, a huge disappointment to me.",
        "Langston: Or maybe it's a sign, okay? So you almost won. So you know that there's a lot of people here who love you and support you in all that, right?",
        "Dorian: Not enough.",
        "Langston: Okay, but the person who you love the most is in London, David. So maybe you're supposed to go be with him right now. Maybe it's time you focused on your personal life.",
        "Dorian: I have a personal life, but I wanted to be mayor!",

        "Viki: When I ran for mayor, oh, I did so with high hopes and the very best of intentions. I could not have foreseen that my family was going to suffer such a terrible loss so soon. My daughter has lost her husband. My husband's lost his son. And the man who has caused my family such unimaginable hurt has come back into our lives. There's going to be a trial, at least one trial, and it will probably be in another state, and I truly think it would be unfair to this city and to my family for me to try and serve as mayor.",

I mean, I saw all your stuff here. Listen to me. If she would have gotten away with it, I would never have seen you again. Dani, I'm sorry. Dani, I was just--I shouldn't have touched her.

        "Rex: The man's too dangerous for even me to speak to him?",

        "Noelle: Stacy knows you spent the night at Schuyler's?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and she's jumping to conclusions and dying for Rex to find out. And trust me, this is the last thing he needs right now.",

I would lie, I would cheat, I would steal. It didn't matter. I still slept at night. At least I passed out anyway.",
