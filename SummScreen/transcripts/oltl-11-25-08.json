        "Vanessa: Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Sarah: Layla! What's that smell?",
        "Layla: Could be the turkey or my sweet potatoes with cinnamon.",
        "Sarah: Oh. Are we all out of waffles again?",
        "Layla: Girl, we got to start cooking early on Thanksgiving.",
        "Sarah: Can't we just order takeout?",
        "Layla: Sarah, bite your tongue. Didn't you do this growing up?",
        "Sarah: When Tina was around, which sure wasn't very often, she wasn't cooking.",
        "Layla: You will love it.",
        "Sarah: Spending the whole day in the kitchen?",
        "Layla: No. Thanksgiving.",
        "Sarah: Bah, humbug.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Eso es como usted lo dice, si? Happy Thanksgiving?",
        "Cristian: That's right. That's how you say it. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Vanessa: You look tired. Did you sleep all right?",
        "Cristian: Well, I kept having nightmares that my mom was going to wake me up at 5:00 in the morning to help with the pernil.",
        "Vanessa: Well, I'm sure it doesn't help that Lola and I have taken over your bedroom.",
        "Cristian: It's not like you did it on purpose. The court named me as your guardian until your trial's over.",
        "Vanessa: That doesn't mean you have to be happy about it.",
        "Cristian: I'm fine with it. Really.",
        "Vanessa: But is Sarah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Am I being a brat?",
        "Layla: You? No. You're a peach.",
        "Sarah: It's not my fault that the only good thing about this stupid holiday is when those giant balloons get loose.",
        "Layla: You know what? I'd be ready to pop a few balloons myself if some woman moved in with my man.",
        "Sarah: So why won't you just let me be miserable?",
        "Layla: Because that's who Cristian is. He takes care of people who help him.",
        "Sarah: Yeah. He's a peach.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hi, I'm Nora Hanen. I'm the district attorney. Nun: Oh, Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Nora: Happy Thanksgiving to you as well. We're here to commit this patient, Brody Lovett.",
        "Nun: Has Mr. Lovett signed the commitment papers?",
        "Nora: Yes, he has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Mom, Dad. Don't worry, it's me.",
        "Viki: How are you, honey?",
        "Jessica: I'm okay.",
        "Viki: Are you ready to go to St. Ann's?",
        "Jessica: Today?",
        "Viki: If it's too soon, you don't have to, honey.",
        "Jessica: No. No, I want to go. I have to go. I need help.",
        "Clint: Honey, you won't be doing this alone. We'll be with you every step of the way.",
        "Natalie: And me, too. If you'll let me.",
        "Natalie: How are you?",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Natalie: You look better.",
        "Jessica: Well, I slept. There's not much else to do here.",
        "Viki: Oh, my. Beautiful flowers.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, they came this morning.",
        "Clint: Want me to read the card?",
        "Jessica: Uh, no. The nurse did. They're from Kevin and Joey.",
        "Viki: Your brothers love you very much, and they wish they could be here for you.",
        "Jessica: The nurse also brought these this morning.",
        "Clint: The commitment papers?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'm supposed to sign them, but it's a little tricky with... no, Mom.",
        "Viki: It's all right, darling.",
        "Jessica: I don't think that you're supposed to --",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, it's okay. Your father and I are here, and nothing is going to happen, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Sorry to make you work on Thanksgiving.",
        "Nora: Oh, don't be ridiculous. You've probably made the world a safer place, keeping me out of the kitchen.",
        "Brody: I really, really appreciate everything you've done for me.",
        "Nora: All I did was sign off on the plea agreement.",
        "Brody: You kept me out of prison.",
        "Nora: I just made it happen. But you do have a lot of people who care about you.",
        "Brody: What are you doing here?",
        "Wes: You think we'd be anywhere else?",
        "Brody: Today? I sure do.",
        "Gigi: We wanted to be here.",
        "Rex: Nora says you can't have visitors for a while.",
        "Brody: So you're spending your holiday in the looney bin?",
        "Rex: Hey, don't knock it. We hear they serve great bird.",
        "Gigi: Nora, did you find out any more information on how long he'll have to stay here?",
        "Nora: No, no. My office will be in touch with the doctors, they'll be communicating, and we'll be apprised of Brody's progress.",
        "Rex: What does that mean?",
        "Nora: Well, we'll see how he does, and if he gets better, then we'll have his case re-evaluated.",
        "Brody: And then what?",
        "Nora: At this point, I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: It doesn't help that Vanessa is, like, Ms. Columbia 2008.",
        "Layla: Hot?",
        "Sarah: Smoking.",
        "Layla: Oh, right. And you have to wear a bag over your head.",
        "Sarah: Well, you haven't seen her.",
        "Layla: Oh, I don't need to. Cristian likes you, remember?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, well, now he feels like he owes her something.",
        "Layla: Well, you know, she did get him out of that prison.",
        "Sarah: She paid someone off. It's not like she tunneled under the building or anything.",
        "Layla: It still was a risk.",
        "Sarah: Not if she got something out of it, too.",
        "Layla: What did she get out of it?",
        "Sarah: I don't know. A one-way ticket out of Colombia? And now Cristian feels like he has to come to her rescue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You think Sarah doesn't want you here?",
        "Lola: Good morning. What's for breakfast?",
        "Vanessa: Um, I'll fix you something in a minute. Why don't you wish Cristian Happy Thanksgiving?",
        "Lola: Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Cristian: Happy Thanksgiving, Lola.",
        "Lola: Are you making turkey?",
        "Cristian: No, but Sarah's roommate is. We're going to go to her place.",
        "Vanessa: A whole turkey, huh? Sounds like a big job.",
        "Cristian: You guys are invited, too.",
        "Lola: Can I call Langston? Wish her a Happy Thanksgiving?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, sure.",
        "Vanessa: Look, it's bad enough that Sarah can't be with you while we're here, do you think she's going to be happy about us going to her place for Thanksgiving dinner as well?",
        "Cristian: Trust me. Sarah's fine with the idea.",
        "Sarah: Cristian is bringing Vanessa to Thanksgiving dinner, did you know that?",
        "Layla: Okay. Well, we've got plenty of food. I guess he kind of has to, doesn't he?",
        "Sarah: Okay. So I have to like it?",
        "Sarah: I just miss him, okay?",
        "Layla: I get it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sarah: That could be Cristian.",
        "Layla: Well, he better be ready to help me cook.",
        "Sarah: Mom.",
        "Tina: Hi, sweetie. Can I come in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Look, Sarah knows this is just a temporary situation. We all understand that.",
        "Vanessa: Yes, we do.",
        "Langston: What are you doing for Thanksgiving dinner?",
        "Lola: We're going to Christian's girlfriend's.",
        "Langston: Do you have to?",
        "Lola: What do you mean?",
        "Langston: Do you want to come over here and spend the day with us?",
        "Lola: Let me ask. Vanessa? Langston invited me to Thanksgiving dinner. Can I please go?",
        "Vanessa: It's fine with me.",
        "Lola: I can come.",
        "Langston: Perfect, we'll come get you.",
        "Lola: We?",
        "Langston: Yeah, me and my boyfriend Markko. You remember him, right?",
        "Lola: I do. Yeah. Thanks, bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Mom, this is Layla. Layla, my mom.",
        "Layla: It is so nice to finally meet you. Sarah has told me so much about you.",
        "Tina: Oh, listen, I can explain. I really can. I mean, most of it.",
        "Layla: Okay, so you'll stay for dinner?",
        "Tina: No, I don't think I can.",
        "Sarah: Oh, come on, Mom. I'm sure Aunt Viki will understand.",
        "Tina: No, honey, it's not -- it's not that. I came to say goodbye.",

        "Viki: Oh, look at you.",
        "Jessica: Let's go.",
        "Viki: Uh, in a minute, darling.",
        "Jessica: Mom, I just want to get this over with.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know. But, you need to say goodbye to your daughters first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: What do you mean, goodbye?",
        "Tina: I'm going away.",
        "Sarah: For how long?",
        "Tina: I'm not sure.",
        "Layla: I'm going to go check my e-mails while the pies cool off.",
        "Sarah: So all that stuff about you staying here and being a mother to me, that was all just talk, right?",
        "Tina: No, I came here to see if you're okay. And, uh -- I mean, you are. Look at you, I mean you -- oh, honey, you are great.",
        "Sarah: What happened?",
        "Tina: Why would you say that?",
        "Sarah: Because that's why you always leave.",
        "Tina: What, can't someone just be restless? You know, want to try some place new?",
        "Sarah: What about Aunt Viki? Doesn't she want you to stay?",
        "Tina: I saw Tess do it.",
        "Viki: When?",
        "Tina: The day she locked Natalie in the basement. I knew what was going on all along.",
        "Viki: I want you out of this house, okay? And this time, don't ever come back.",
        "Tina: Um, no.",
        "Sarah: Why not?",
        "Tina: Look, let's just say I made a -- I made a bad decision, okay? And I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Sarah: What kind of bad decision?",
        "Tina: Look, I said I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Sarah: Why?",
        "Tina: Look, you're going to find out soon enough, all right? And then you're going to be really happy that I left. So, uh, wow. What kind of pies did you make? Pumpkin and pecan. Gee, maybe I could take it with.",
        "Sarah: Mom.",
        "Tina: What?",
        "Sarah: You're not going anywhere until you tell me what you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey. You mama's special little girl? Huh? I missed you so much. But guess what? You know what? You have a brand new baby sister, huh? Isn't that fun? I don't know how I'm going to leave you. I don't know how I'm going to leave you.",

        "Brody: Sure beats a prison cell.",
        "Rex: Wes seems like a good guy.",
        "Brody: I trust him with my life.",
        "Rex: Guess that's what it's like in battle?",
        "Brody: Yeah, well, the guys in your squad, they have to have your back. They have to be willing to die for you.",
        "Rex: And you're willing to die for them?",
        "Brody: It's part of the job.",
        "Rex: I don't know if I could do that. I'm not exactly what you would call brave. Actually, I think the word's chicken.",
        "Brody: I would be proud to serve next to you.",
        "Rex: You're joking, right?",

        "Tina: Oh, oh.",
        "Sarah: You're not going to tell me, are you?",
        "Tina: Honey, it -- that's not important now. What's important is for me to be able to see your beautiful face.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, right. Where are you going to go?",
        "Tina: Um, I don't know. Not Mendorra. Not Maryland, and certainly not Argentina.",
        "Sarah: What about Cain?",
        "Tina: No, I have to do this myself. No Cain, no Cord.",
        "Sarah: No David Vickers?",
        "Tina: Well, I'm not going to be that alone. And neither will you.",
        "Sarah: You're giving him to me?",
        "Tina: Yeah. You'd be a better mother to him than I ever was to you.",
        "Sarah: Mom, this is crazy. All those years where I didn't see you, and now you're leaving again?",
        "Tina: Honey, I really wish I didn't have to.",
        "Sarah: Well, then don't. Stay. It's Thanksgiving.",
        "Tina: Honey, I... I can't, okay, but... take care of the puppy, okay? And know that -- I mean, he means well. Even though sometimes he makes mistakes, just... just like someone else you know. waterproof",
        "Sarah: I love you, Mom.",
        "Tina: And I love you. Honey, just know that if you see anything good in me at all, it's because of you. And, uh -- mascara, huh? I always swear by it.",
        "Sarah: One last little bit of motherly advice?",
        "Tina: Yes. I never was very good at saying goodbye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Do you know what day it is today? Huh? It's Thanksgiving. And you know what? I am so thankful for you. Sweetie, I love you so much. And I'm so sorry that the past couple of months have -- well, they've stunk, haven't they, huh? And that's because mama's been very sick. But I'm going to get better, okay? But I got to go away for a little while, and when I come back, I'm going to be your mommy. And we are going to have so much fun. We're going to have so much fun.",

        "Brody: Hey, Shane.",
        "Shane: This doesn't look like a jail.",
        "Brody: It's not. And I have your mom and dad to thank for that. They wanted me to be in a place where I can get better.",
        "Shane: You seem better now.",
        "Brody: I'm getting there, but I still have a lot of work to do. That's why I'm here.",
        "Shane: My mom said that what happened was because of the war. I hoped, maybe, that you can come home now.",
        "Brody: Well, this place isn't so bad. They even have checkers.",
        "Shane: I'm totally going to waste you.",
        "Rex: Shane likes checkers. I didn't even know that.",
        "Gigi: You sure you're okay with this?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Brody: How's school?",
        "Shane: Okay, I guess. Yesterday was the Thanksgiving play.",
        "Brody: Your mom told me about that. She said you played a turkey.",
        "Shane: Yeah. All my feathers fell off. Dad, it was so lame. You should have seen it.",
        "Shane: Mom got a new camera today. She's going to take tons of pictures of the Christmas pageant.",
        "Brody: They're already planning that?",
        "Shane: Yeah, I'm going to be a wise man. I got a fake beard and everything.",
        "Brody: A wise man, huh? Talk about typecasting.",
        "Shane: Brody? Are you okay?",
        "Shane: Brody.",
        "Wes: Everything all right?",
        "Brody: Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Shane, this is Wes Granger. Wes, this is Shane.",
        "Wes: It's good to meet you, Shane.",
        "Shane: Brody told me a lot about you. You were in the same squad in Iraq.",
        "Wes: Hmm. You know, I remember the day that Brody earned that medal. He saved the lives of three men in our company.",
        "Shane: Were you there?",
        "Wes: I'd say so. I was one of them.",
        "Shane: Cool.",
        "Wes: Yeah, it was cool. Brody was a great soldier.",
        "Shane: I knew it.",
        "Wes: Hey, Shane, um, why don't you go see if your mom wants to play checkers, huh?",
        "Shane: Okay.",
        "Wes: Hey, you're still there, aren't you? You got that look. I get it, too, sometimes, when I remember.",
        "Brody: Just remember. I see stuff that -- that -- it seems real.",
        "Wes: Makes sense. After all the time we spent wishing it wasn't.",
        "Brody: I need help.",
        "Wes: That's what you're here for.",
        "Brody: What if it doesn't work?",
        "Wes: What -- look, man, it will. You're always going to remember what happened, huh? But after awhile, it's -- it won't be real.",
        "Brody: I sure as hell hope so.",

        "Sarah: Why? Because he's so cute, I'll forgive him for anything?",
        "Layla: You're still sad about Vanessa and your mom. I know you liked having her here.",
        "Sarah: Are you kidding? I've done this dance a million times. She splits. I get upset. And then I get over it. Then she comes back and tells me everything is going to be different, and I buy it. Then she splits again. At least I got a puppy out of it. He is pretty cute. I just wonder what my mom did this time.",
