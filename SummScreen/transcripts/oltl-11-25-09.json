        "Starr: I think you might want to go grab breakfast, too, because this might take a while.",
        "Cole: Have I told you that you're way braver than I am? What?",
        "Starr: Well, at least my mom made this stuffing before she and Sam left to go watch Jack play a pilgrim. And I really hope that someone is going to be around to eat this besides us, because -- ugh. Well, Aunt Dorian's in London, and my dad's off chasing T\u00e9a, and your mom's on call.",
        "Cole: You know, you can always bail on the turkey, and we can order takeout.",
        "Starr: I don't think so. I am not telling Hope that her first Thanksgiving was spent eating pizza. We're having turkey.",
        "Cole: I don't even remember what we ate last year.",
        "Starr: Well, Aunt Dorian had a huge, fancy feast to try to make everyone happy, but there didn't seem to be much to be thankful for.",
        "Cole: Yeah, we didn't have her.",

        "Shane: Dad says these are the money shots.",
        "Gigi: All right. Just don't get in Moe's way. He has a lot to do.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: There you go. Aren't they pretty? Huh? We have to pick them all, because soon, they're going to be gone. Did you have a fun time at Renee's? Was it? It was fun?",

        "Cristian: So did Mami wake you up in 5:00 in the morning to make the pig? Just a hunch. Yeah, yeah, let me talk to her. Tell Jamie that I love her like madness, and Happy Thanksgiving. Hey. So you couldn't let Antonio sleep in, huh? How's he doing? Yeah, I know. Well, it's his first holiday without Talia.",
        "Layla: Did you talk to your parents?",
        "Oliver: Um, I left them a message. I thought they'd call back by now.",
        "Layla: They'll come around.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, hey, everything's good here. Kyle is making -- well, no, Kyle is bringing the vegetables. Fish is making the eggnog. And Layla is working her magic on the bird. Me? No, I'm just keeping up on the football for everybody. We're good. We have a lot to be thankful for this year.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Oh, Morris, how could I know that Mitch Laurence was still alive? I never would have told Rex that was his daddy if I knew that. Now Rex hates me more than ever.",

        "Roxy: It's a porcupine. How much did you hear?",

        "Roxy: Well, last Thanksgiving was great. Kyle: Oh, yeah?",

        "Rex: I want to tell Shane first. So how do I do this, Morasco? How do I tell my son that his grandfather is the devil himself?",
        "Gigi: With my help.",
        "Rex: I might take you up on that. But not today. This is Thanksgiving. It was a year ago today that he finally called me Dad for the first time.",
        "Gigi: Jessica may have a creep for a father, but she's really lucky to have you for a brother.",

        "Natalie: No, I just -- I mean -- you know, after Nash died, I always felt so guilty whenever you saw me with Jared.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God.",
        "Natalie: All I'm saying is, I just -- I don't -- I don't want you to feel that way, either one of you. You shouldn't feel guilty for being happy.",
        "Brody: Go play, go.",
        "Bree: Aunt Natty --",
        "Natalie: Yeah, sweetie? What is it?",

        "Viki: And I'm -- I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to tell you, but you were asleep last night, and there were some reporters outside, and I spoke with them.",
        "Charlie: So you're just going to throw away a job that meant so much to you?",
        "Viki: I'm not throwing it away, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Well, I don't know what you call it then. And I hope you're not doing this on my account, because I don't want that. I don't need it, and I definitely don't deserve it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So you could end up mayor?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. Oh!",
        "Starr: Okay, you're ready.",
        "Dorian: I can't stand the wait, I tell you. But yes, we'll be hearing any minute, because the city council is meeting right now, even as we speak.",
        "Starr: On Thanksgiving?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes, my darling. What choice do they have? After all, Mayor Lowell is in prison, and -- well -- forget the spoon, okay? Just forget -- nothing beats this. Your Aunt Viki -- ha, ha -- well, she has decided to abandon the citizens of this town.",
        "Starr: No, Aunt Dorian, you know her. Aunt Viki would never abandon anyone.",
        "Dorian: Of course, dear. She has, as she put it -- she needs to spend more time with her family.",
        "Starr: Her daughter's husband just died. Could you imagine if something happened to the Cramer girls?",
        "Dorian: Heaven forbid. Though I would like to think that no matter what, I would meet my obligations.",
        "Starr: You would do the exact same thing if you were in her shoes.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Dorian: Oh. Oh, it's about time. Come in!",
        "Amelia: The council took some time agreeing on a solution.",
        "Dorian: Oh, of course they did. Of course they did. Why come up with an easy answer when it's so much more fun devising some Byzantine reason why they don't just hand the job to the person who lost by one measly vote?",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian, just let Amelia talk.",
        "Dorian: Of course, darling. I'm -- I'm sorry. And what, Amelia, was the city council's decision?",
        "Amelia: Congratulations, Mayor Lord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I love you so much. I think you know that. But, sweetheart, I am not giving up this position for you.",
        "Charlie: Well, then who are you doing it for?",
        "Viki: I'm doing it for me. Honestly, for me. Charlie, I need to be here now. I want to be here now. Look, after Nash died, I went to Africa. My children were in terrible trouble. They needed me. I was not here. And I will never stop regretting that.",
        "Charlie: I know. Okay, but you can support your loved ones without giving up something that means so much to you.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, tomorrow, Natalie is burying her husband. You are burying your son. And the man who has terrorized my family for years and years is back in our lives. This is not a time for me to start a very big and a very difficult job.",
        "Charlie: Well, it just seems like a very big sacrifice. Then again, what do I know about making sacrifices? Unless you're talking about sacrificing your family for the bottle.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I know you blame yourself for everything that happened when you were drinking, but you are not drinking now. You are sober. And Jared forgave you. Jared loved you. You must learn to forgive yourself.",
        "Charlie: I'm just really not sure that I can do that.",
        "Viki: I think you have to try. And I would like to help you.",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Viki: Hey, you know what? This town deserves a mayor who will give it 100% of her attention. I cannot do that now.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but what if that mayor is Dorian? Do you really want to leave Llanview in the hands of Dorian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: The city council has selected me as mayor?",
        "Amelia: Since you came in such a close second, they felt you clearly represented the will of the people.",
        "Dorian: Yes! Yes!",
        "Starr: There she goes.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Starr: I'm very, very happy for you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm very, very happy! Oh, sweetie --",
        "Cole: Hey, congratulations.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you. Thank you so -- where's Langston?",
        "Starr: Langston's having Thanksgiving with Markko's family, remember?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes, that's right.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: I guess that's understandable, even if Markko did choose to vote for Viki.",
        "Cole: Yeah, they're all -- they're all working at a soup kitchen.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Well, we wouldn't want to disturb their being positive role models for the citizens of Llanview.",
        "Cole: Amen.",
        "Amelia: Now you can really make a difference in the fight for gay rights.",
        "Dorian: Right.",
        "Starr: But I thought your heart was set on going to London to see David.",
        "Dorian: Yes. It was, indeed. But I made a promise that I would use the power of the office of mayor to legitimize same-sex marriages.",
        "Starr: But what about David?",
        "Dorian: Da -- well, you see, even though my union with Amelia is merely symbolic, I did make a promise to the gay community. Yes, and I cannot abandon them. Gay people across this entire country are counting on me, and I am not going to let them down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Oh. Well, I'd better get started if I'm going to have this ready in time for dinner.",
        "Roxy: You're not nuking a bird in your room, are you? 'Cause I'm not zoned for that.",
        "Kyle: No, Oliver invited me over to spend the day with Cristian and Layla.",
        "Roxy: Well, that sounds good.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, now I just got to learn how to make a green bean casserole in a hot plate.",
        "Roxy: Good luck.",
        "Kyle: You going to talk to your daughter today?",
        "Roxy: I think she needs her other mother right now. Really, it's okay.",
        "Kyle: I -- I bet Oliver wouldn't mind if I brought over a guest.",
        "Roxy: Thank you, but I really don't want to be a sixth wheel.",
        "Kyle: You sure?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I'm sure. I got plenty of stuff to do here. But go ahead. Go make that casserole.",
        "Gigi: Thank you.",

        "Noelle: Oh, I wonder how Charlie's doing today.",
        "Moe: You know, we met Charlie when he was searching for Jared.",
        "Noelle: As soon as he found him, he was a changed man.",
        "Moe: Mm-hmm.",
        "Noelle: He was so proud to be a father again.",
        "Moe: Well, thank goodness they had some time together.",
        "Noelle: Yeah. Have you heard from Viki and Charlie yet, Moe?",
        "Moe: Not yet. We figured Thanksgiving would be the last thing they'd want to think about.",
        "Noelle: Yeah, so we called them, left them a message, invited them over here.",
        "Gigi: Well, it was a nice idea.",
        "Moe: I don't know. We haven't heard one word.",

And we have Ms. Destiny to bring us light and laughter into our lives. And so many families don't have what we have. Rich families, like the Buchanans.",
        "Phylicia: What are you saying?",
        "Mr. Evans: Maybe our time is best spent reaching out to them, rather than nursing a grudge against Gregory and Rachel.",

        "Greg: How about there? There?",
        "Matthew: No, I still can't feel anything.",

        "Bo: And the last thing I want to do is hurt my brother, but I love you, too.",

        "Greg: It is possible.",
        "Matthew: Thanks.",

        "Phylicia: Well, I always make too much.",
        "Nora: You brought all this for us?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: This is a momentous occasion. Darling, we should be celebrating. How often does your aunt get elected mayor?",
        "Starr: Twice in my case.",
        "Dorian: Of course. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be happy this second time.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. I really -- I -- I am happy for you. I just keep thinking that the only reason that you're mayor now is because Jared Banks died, and he was a part of my family and Hope's.",
        "Cole: For a while, they were her only family.",

        "Viki: Happy Thanksgiving, Dorian. I know that it is very hard today to think about celebrating anything. Because there's such an empty place at the table. But I -- I found this -- this poem that has brought me comfort in the past. And given that today is a day to celebrate and to share, I -- I really thought I'd like to share it with all of you. \"Is it so small a thing to have enjoyed the sun? Is it so small a thing to have lived light in the spring? Is it so small a thing to have thought, to have done? Is it so small a thing to have a brother and a son? Is it so small a thing to have played? To have run? Is it so small a thing to have honored a father? To have spun 3 dreams for his one? Is it so small a thing to have beaten down baffling foes? Is it so small a thing to have eased someone's woes? And lifted someone's lows? Is it so small a thing to have advanced true friends? Is it so small a thing to have made these amends? Is it so small a thing to have brought a family such joy? Is it so small a thing to have been a boy -- just a boy?\" I just want to say, it is no small thing that Jared gave us. And I am very, very grateful to him for that. And I want to thank all of you for being here today, and for celebrating, all of us, together. Oh --",

        "Singer: I tasted tasted love so sweet and all of it was lost on me bought and sold like property sugar on my tongue I kept falling over I kept looking backward I went broke believing that the simple should be hard all we are, we are all we are, we are and every day's a start of something beautiful I wasted wasted love for you trading out for something new well, it's hard to change the way you lose if you think you've never won 'cause all we are, we are all we are, we are and every day's a start of something beautiful and in the end the words won't matter 'cause in the end nothing stays the same and in the end dreams just scatter and fall like rain"
