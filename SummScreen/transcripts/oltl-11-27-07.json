        "Sarah: Last cherry -- anybody?",
        "Antonio: Uh-uh.",
        "Cristian: All yours.",
        "Sarah: Mmm. Your mom's pies are to die for. Is there any more pumpkin?",
        "Talia: No, we finished that one off.",
        "Antonio: No, the only thing that's left is cleanup time.",
        "Cristian: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Huh -- not you. My mom can't afford to be buying glasses.",
        "Sarah: I'll be careful.",
        "Cristian: Right, as careful as you were when you were waitressing at Capricorn? Four glasses her first day.",
        "Sarah: It was not four.",
        "Antonio: Well, whatever it was, it doesn't matter -- you guys are off the hook. Cris did most of the cooking, so I'll handle this. Why don't you take Sarah home?",
        "Cristian: Are you sure?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I'm positive. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Sarah: Thank you, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: You're welcome.",
        "Sarah: Will you tell your mom thank you for making me feel so welcome?",
        "Antonio: I will -- I will tell her tomorrow. I'm sure that she and Jamie will be passed out by the time I get back.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Sarah: Happy Thanksgiving, Talia.",
        "Talia: You, too. I hope we see you again soon.",
        "Antonio: Ah.",
        "Talia: This was great.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, it went well.",
        "Talia: All right, well, I will help.",
        "Antonio: No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait a second -- you're a guest and you're off-duty, right, so you can go home, too.",
        "Talia: Well, what if I'd rather stay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Some Thanksgiving, huh -- in a roadside diner?",
        "Charlie: The best one I've had in -- huh -- I can't remember when.",
        "Viki: Spending the day with Moe and his waitresses? Listening to Moe and Noelle bicker about a bake-off?",
        "Charlie: Spending the day with you.",
        "Nigel: I was just wondering, Sir, if by any chance you've reconsidered your --",
        "Jared: Nope.",
        "Nigel: You do know that the Buchanan family will not simply accept a written note as proof, and a DNA test --",
        "Jared: Will prove that I'm not Asa's son. You think that hasn't occurred to me, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: Of course not -- you're obviously a very shrewd young man, and I just --",
        "Jared: You're having a panic attack, Nigel. There are pills for that.",
        "Nigel: If you're suggesting that I need a tranquilizer --",
        "Jared: I am suggesting that you take a look at the big picture here, Nige, old boy. This could be good for the both of us. You don't want the Buchanans finding out Vickers is Asa's son, and if they believe I am -- well, then you can take the truth to the grave.",
        "Nigel: And what about the other dilemma I pointed out to you? If you successfully pose as Mr. Buchanan's son, you will also be for all the world Natalie's uncle. Do you want a seat on the board of Buchanan Enterprises so badly that you would be willing to abruptly stop what seems to be starting with her?",
        "Jared: Ahem.",
        "Natalie: So, Nash and Jessica just got their car to go to the airport.",
        "Jared: When do we leave?",
        "Natalie: Uh, in a couple of hours. I thought we could just hang out till then.",
        "Jared: Okay, yeah.",
        "Nigel: If you'll excuse me, I have personal affairs to attend to, as do you, Mr. Banks.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: What was that all about?",
        "David: Hey. Anyone seen Dorian?",
        "Natalie: She left.",
        "David: Oh, man. I was hoping to catch a ride with her out of here. You see, Natalie, my wife, Alex, and I have been married for over a week, so we're taking a little bit of a break. And your dad unceremoniously dumped Dorian after he realized that she was a woman of very little willpower, to put it delicately.",
        "Natalie: Your point?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: My point is when Dorian gets dumped, it doesn't go very well.",
        "Nora: You expecting a call?",
        "Clint: No. I was going to make one.",
        "Nora: Everything all right?",
        "Clint: I broke it off with Dorian.",
        "Nora: And you're having a change of heart?",
        "Clint: No. I'm not going to call her because it's over as well it should be after what happened, what I walked in on. I'll be happy if I never see her again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: My uncle owned a restaurant in New York. It was called khubuz. It's Arabic for \"bread.\" I used to work there sometimes. I would waitress. I even did some of the cooking. Oh -- I was -- so do you want me to put these in the sink?",
        "Antonio: Straight through the door on the left.",
        "Talia: Okay.",
        "Antonio: I guess we have the restaurant thing in common, huh?",
        "Talia: Yeah, but I'm experienced with falafel, not flan. But it was like this place. You know, it was simple, good food for an honest price. Rag.",
        "Antonio: Uh, it's right --",
        "Talia: Got it.",
        "Antonio: Uh -- Cristian actually spent more time at the diner than I did. I was too busy getting into trouble.",
        "Talia: Yeah, you mentioned that, but you never mentioned what kind of trouble.",
        "Antonio: Well, not so sure you want to know.",
        "Talia: I do -- you know, if you want to share.",
        "Antonio: I got mixed up with gangs and, uh, did some time for murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I really enjoy spending time with you, Charlie. You know that, right?",
        "Charlie: But?",
        "Viki: I -- I think that we have to be realistic, you know, about what this is and where it's going. That's all.",
        "Charlie: Uh-oh, here it comes.",
        "Viki: No, no, no -- no. No, I'm not going to drop a bomb. Look, you and I both came to Paris looking for something. My quest is a little more vague than yours.",
        "Charlie: And have you found what you were looking for?",
        "Viki: I'm living a life that is so different from what I'm used to, and I'm making it work.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm glad that one of us is getting somewhere.",
        "Viki: Hey, you're going to find your son. Yes, you will, and the thing is when you do, you'll move on, you know, and you'll be -- you'll be gone from Paris, Texas, and -- and from my life.",
        "Charlie: But, you know, I don't have to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I'm sorry. What? Oh, well, I didn't say that you and Dorian were a match made in heaven -- that would be a big, fat lie -- but you care a great deal about her and I'm sorry you had to end it. I'm even more sorry that I had something to do with it.",
        "Clint: That garbage that she was spouting -- I hope you didn't take any of it to heart.",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake, Clint. She did see us kiss.",
        "Clint: Yeah, but she could've confronted me and handled the situation like, oh, let's say an adult.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: Yes, well --",
        "Clint: But, no, as always, she reacted in the worst possible way.",
        "Nora: Well, you do have a point there.",
        "Clint: With David Vickers, of all people. Then she had the gall to equate our actions with hers. Suddenly, our kiss was on the same level with her going to bed with David, and then on top of that, she refused to believe that nothing was going on between you and me.",
        "Nora: Huh. Well, what does she think? What, one kiss and we were suddenly a couple, that we're going to fly off to Vegas and tie the knot?",
        "Clint: Ridiculous.",
        "Nora: You couldn't convince her that it was nothing?",
        "Clint: No, she thought the kiss held great meaning.",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Clint: But it wasn't just the kiss that broke us up. I mean, Dorian and I have been having problems for a while.",
        "Nora: Well, you must have. I mean, if you were going to kiss me, I just -- well, I mean, you must have.",
        "[Dorian groans]",
        "Clint: Do you hear something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Look at this -- I'm losing my hair over this. Do I have a bald spot?",
        "Natalie: Yes. What I know of Dorian is that she can take care of herself.",
        "David: Yeah, but what about me? I got to find her.",
        "Natalie: David, wait. Haven't you done enough? Leave it alone.",
        "David: And this is your business how?",
        "Natalie: Because Dorian's my dad's girlfriend. You make things worse, it affects him, too.",
        "David: Oh, no, no, no. When Dorian gets dumped, it doesn't get worse. Whatever she's about to do, I've got to stop her. Ow! Son of a --",
        "Jared: You had a bug, it's --",
        "David: What kind of bug?",
        "Jared: It was a spider.",
        "David: A spider? Well, how big? What color? Was there a diamond shape on its back, or is that snakes? Was there a snake in my hair?",
        "Jared: Oh, by the way, I think I saw Dr. Lord out in the front lawn a minute ago or something.",
        "David: Why didn't you say so?",
        "Natalie: So, what were we talking about? Oh, yes -- our last night in Texas together.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "Natalie: What? What's wrong? Do I have a spider in my hair, too?",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Natalie: Then why aren't you responding to me? Did I imagine that we were kissing last night and we'd have done a whole lot more if we hadn't decided to be sensible?",
        "Jared: No, you didn't imagine that.",
        "Natalie: And that we talked about it and we were going to get close when we got back home. I -- we did agree on that, I recall.",
        "Jared: You recall correctly.",
        "Natalie: So what's the problem? You change your mind about us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: What can I get you?",
        "Cristian: Are you kidding? I am stuffed. Thanks.",
        "Sarah: Oh, thank God. Me, too. Great dinner.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, it was. Hey, are those the records you inherited from Asa?",
        "Sarah: Yeah. It's an awesome record player, too. Hey, you want to hear what he was into?",
        "Cristian: Sure, play something.",
        "Sarah: Um -- you sure I can't get you a drink?",
        "Cristian: No, trust me, I'm fine.",
        "Sarah: Okay.",
        "Singer: Take back your promise you don't need those lines anymore you're gonna wear yourself down",
        "Cristian: Sarah --",
        "Singer: Running around",
        "Cristian: Remember when I told you on the phone before that I missed you?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, yeah, I get it. You meant I was needed around the club.",
        "Cristian: No, that's not what I meant. I meant --",
        "Singer: Well, I've watched you for hours",
        "Cristian: I missed you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Nothing has changed for me. When I feel something for someone, I --",
        "Natalie: Spit it out.",
        "Jared: Look, last night everything I said was sincere. That kiss was real.",
        "Natalie: So what's the problem?",
        "Jared: I don't want to hurt you.",
        "Natalie: You don't want to hurt me? Hmm.",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Natalie: How nice! But you do want to piss me off? Otherwise, you wouldn't suddenly be acting like you feel sorry for me and that is something I really, really hate.",
        "Jared: Oh, I don't feel sorry for you, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: I can see it in your eyes now -- \"I don't want to hurt you.\"",
        "Jared: Okay, will you just let me explain?",
        "Natalie: How about I explain it since I seem to be the only one who's sane here? I don't back off of situations or people because I'm afraid it's not going to last forever, because life doesn't last forever and I'm not going to stop living. If it feels good right here, right now, I am all about it. I don't ask for guarantees and I certainly don't give them. So, why can't we just have a good time together, you know? Hurt each other -- so be it. We'll just do our best not to hurt each other -- does that work for you?",
        "Renee: Oh! Well, well, well.",
        "Jared: Ahem.",
        "Renee: I'm sorry -- this is a surprise.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Renee, we kind of mended fences last night.",
        "Renee: Well, I'm glad. I hope you worked out whatever it was you had to work out.",
        "Natalie: Me, too.",
        "Renee: You know, everything in this room, in this house, reminds me of me and Asa -- so many wonderful memories.",
        "Natalie: Must be really hard to hand it back over to Chuck.",
        "Renee: Oh, no, no, no. I love Chuck -- hmm. I don't think that Asa wanted me to live in the past. I don't need a house of memories -- I can carry my memories with me wherever I go.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, we all will.",
        "Renee: Oh, Jared. I so wish that you had known Asa.",
        "Jared: You know, I feel I've gotten to know him a little better from, well, being in the place that he loved so much and spending time with his family.",
        "[Renee chuckles]",
        "Jared: It's --",
        "Renee: Oh, and he would've liked you so much. I know that from the past few days. That's why I want you to have something of his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Do you know, if I find my son --",
        "Viki: \"When\" you find your son.",
        "Charlie: When I find my son, I honestly don't know what'll happen.",
        "Viki: What do you want to have happen?",
        "Charlie: Well, I want a chance, that's all. I mean, I know that I can't make up for all the years that I've wasted drinking, but one of the 12 steps is called \"reparations,\" and that's what I want. I want the chance just to tell my son that -- that I'm sorry for what my drinking did to his life.",
        "Viki: Oh, boy. I hope you get that chance.",
        "Charlie: You know, it's been years since I've seen him last. I could have grandkids for all I know.",
        "Viki: Charlie -- Charlie, you're such a good man. I know you made mistakes, but you're sober now, you're trying to turn your life around. Obviously, you love your son -- you're trying to make things right with him. I think he probably is going to need some time to learn to trust you again, but I mean, the fact that you're so determined to find him is -- is -- is going to mean a lot to him, you know? It -- it's such a start.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. But I also hope that you know that -- that this doesn't mean that what we have has to end. I -- I mean, I'm not expected to move in with my son, you know? What -- what I mean is --",
        "Viki: Don't -- don't, okay? Don't say any more, please. Can we just appreciate what we have? Live it one day at a time, hmm?",
        "Charlie: That's -- that's how I'm learning to live my life now.",
        "Viki: Is it working?",
        "Charlie: Well, so far.",
        "Viki: Hey! Look what I found. Shall we?",
        "Charlie: Well, it couldn't hurt. Okay. Make a wish.",
        "[Charlie grunts]",
        "Charlie: You won.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I don't hear anything.",
        "Clint: Probably a coyote or a prairie dog.",
        "Nora: Coyote? There are coyote here? Don't -- don't coyotes attack human beings?",
        "Clint: Well, in rural areas, they usually run when they see people.",
        "Nora: \"Usually\"? Okay, that's an operative word -- I'm going inside.",
        "David: Where is Dorian?",
        "Clint: Why in hell are you still here?",
        "David: Because I'm looking for Dorian!",
        "Clint: She left.",
        "David: To go where?",
        "Clint: Don't know, don't care.",
        "David: Oh, right -- because you've moved on. You two are out in the open about your affair, then?",
        "Nora: David, this is not an affair.",
        "David: Oh, come on. It was an accident, then? His clumsy lips just happened to bump into yours -- just an accident, right? I'm glad you didn't break anything, except maybe someone's trust.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, that's rich -- you talking about trust.",
        "David: So you two uptight types are going to stand here and tell me that kiss didn't mean anything? You guys don't blow your nose without thinking it through first, making sure it's the right decision. So, in my book, that kiss that you were having was private and it was passionate and it was one hell of a big deal!",
        "Nora: Excuse me. I'm out of here.",
        "Clint: For the last time, get off this ranch.",
        "[Phone vibrates]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Murder?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, it was -- it was -- ahem. Charges were bogus, you know? They were overturned, but some of the stuff, it was for real.",
        "Talia: Well, it's okay. Look at the man you've become.",
        "Antonio: I -- I guess the most difficult part is that my father passed away thinking I was a bad person.",
        "Talia: I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: You really didn't know about all this? I mean, you know, with the way the guys talk down at the station, I just kind of figured that maybe, you know --",
        "Talia: I heard a few rumors but, I mean, I didn't really listen to them.",
        "Antonio: Well, I appreciate that.",
        "Talia: So, you came back from all of that and you became a cop?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, yeah. It was a long road back -- a few bumps along the way. Hmm -- \"bumps.\" More like barricades.",
        "Talia: Well, you've accomplished a lot and you should be proud.",
        "Antonio: I'm happy where I've ended up.",
        "Talia: So am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: This is the box you showed me -- wow, the first fistful of dirt Asa dug when he broke ground on this place.",
        "Renee: Yes, and I want you to have it. If it stays here, it's just dirt. But if you take it with you, you will be able to take Asa's example which you've so admired and build from it.",
        "Jared: Something from nothing?",
        "Renee: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jared: Huh.",
        "Renee: So, when you're breaking ground under a construction that will fulfill your own vision, I want you to spread this earth around under the foundation so that Asa will be always part of your dream.",
        "Jared: This is -- ah. It means so much.",
        "Renee: Good. Then, we're going to open --",
        "Jared: Oh, ho, ho, ho!",
        "Renee: One of Asa's best bottles of bourbon.",
        "Jared: All right.",
        "Renee: And we're going to have one last toast to this magical place -- oh, Nigel! Nigel, great timing. Get some glasses, please. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You're going to miss this place, aren't you?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Well, that's a stupid question -- everyone's going to miss this place, especially Matthew. I had to wrestle him to get him to pack.",
        "Clint: I know he loves this place, but I bet he's looking forward to going home. I know I am.",
        "Nora: Home -- Asa's place.",
        "Clint: Well, it's your place now.",
        "Nora: Well, that's going to take some getting used to.",
        "Clint: Well, I'll tell you what -- I'm going to make it easier on you. When we get back to Llanview --",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm?",
        "Clint: I'm moving out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Dorian, it's me, it's David. Look, I know you're probably miffed at me, but if it makes you feel any better, I got dumped, too -- huh -- by Alex, which actually would've made me happy except it turns out, like you said, she's flat broke. You were right. I got zip, nothing. But, look, I don't know what my next move is. I just -- I know I want to see you, so call me.",

        "Charlie: So, what did you wish for?",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah, like I'm going to tell you.",
        "Charlie: What -- not even a hint?",
        "Viki: No. It would totally blow my chance of having it come true.",
        "Charlie: Oh, you're superstitious.",
        "Viki: No. I mean, I certainly don't, you know, set about avoiding walking under ladders. And you know what? I broke a mirror once and I had seven years of the best luck ever.",
        "Charlie: So, what, you're a little skeptical?",
        "Viki: Of superstitions, yes.",
        "Charlie: Huh.",
        "Viki: You know what I am? I'm a firm believer in the power of conviction. And I believe in miracles because I've lived through too many not to.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I believe in miracles, too.",
        "Viki: So, you lost. Um -- you can tell me what you wished for.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm sure you can guess. I would've wished for --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Charlie: Oh. Hmm. Uh -- yeah, hello? Really? Where? No -- do you got a --",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah.",

        "Viki: Here. Here.",
        "Charlie: Hmm. Okay, yeah. Okay. Thank you -- thank you so much. Yeah.",
        "Viki: Everything all right?",

        "Renee: Meant everything to him. Oh, yes, his family -- he'd do anything for them. He's well-known for that. But he couldn't control them. The only thing that he could control was his business. And so sometimes it seemed that it meant more to him than the people that he loved.",
