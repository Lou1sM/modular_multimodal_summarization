        "Todd tells Blair about how he came home and found Starr with Cole in the house. He also tells that he has taken Starr out of the school. They call Starr to come down. She does and is angry that her father is being so hard on the boy when he did something much worse to the boy's mother. Todd is furious that Starr is even starting to forgive the boy for what he did and orders her never to see the kid again. Starr tells Todd that he thinks that he is the only one who can make mistakes and get away with them. Bo tells Clint about what Natalie has been saying about John. Bo will not tell Paige anything about this until he knows more. He is investigating even as they speak. Paige arrives and has champagne. She is thrilled. The prognosis for her son's recovery is good and she will finally get a chance to be a mother to Hugh. She says that the very next day, she will get to see Hugh open his eyes and talk with her. Bo tells her not to get her hopes up. Todd isn't happy with the way that Starr's spoken to him and he starts heading to the stairs, but never makes it. Blair collapses before him and he has to give her all his attention. He holds her as she is falling, and seeming to go unconscious. She refuses to go to the hospital, so he gets her tea and aspirins for her head. Michael is not happy with Natalie when she continues about John being in the bed instead of Hugh. He thinks that she is losing it. She tells that the man in the bed has blue eyes, while Hugh has brown. This makes Michael listen somewhat. It is when she brings up Vincent's involvement as Hugh's friend that Michael starts listening. He doesn't like Vincent but it isn't just Natalie saying this. Michael turns to the window and looks in at the man on the bed inside. \"John is that you?\" Michael will work with Natalie to find out what is going on but he warns her to be respectful and let him take the lead. Natalie asks a nurse who comes out of the room to bring her the man with the soccer team in the room. When she gets that picture, Natalie and Michael wait for another nurse to come by. They ask her to look at a picture of John and Hugh and tell who was having the skin graphing done that day. The woman says that she has no idea since she didn't see the patient without his bandages. She has an idea on how she can help though. She tells that if Michael and Natalie scrub up and put on masks and gowns, they can come in and watch as the bandages are being changed. They go for the deal and hover impatiently while the bandages are taken off. When the final strip of fabric is removed, Natalie and Michael are frozen in time. \"It's him!\""

        "Antonio: Ah. You know, I love dancing with you, but it is the first night of our honeymoon.",
        "Jessica: I know.",
        "Antonio: So you want to go upstairs?",
        "Jessica: No. I want to stay right here with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: First you'll have your dinner of mashed peaches and yams, and then I'll have mine. And then we will have a bath and then straight to the crib. Ah-ah- ah. No arguments. Just because you're shacking up with your old man does not mean that you don't have a schedule. I read the books, too -- all of the books. See these? See these? Scrambled eggs. Making them just like your mommy liked them. Ha-ha. \"Scramble my eggs hard,\" your mama used to say. Ah. I guess Jessica wouldn't say that, would she? Hey, I don't know -- maybe she would. You know, I used to be able to tell them apart in a heartbeat. Now, not so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Ok, enough about me. I want to know why you fired Rex.",
        "Todd: Because all his talk about dead ends was a bunch of bull. I was paying him all that money and he was doing absolutely nothing to find my kid.",
        "Blair: That's not true.",
        "Todd: How would you know and why would you defend him?",
        "Blair: You know who took your son -- it's Spencer. He did everything he could to convince everyone in this town including me that you were a murderer and he's good at covering up his tracks.",
        "Todd: That's why I have to get a good lead before they put him away. And I have to find someone with more experience than Rex Balsom.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and who are you going to hire, Todd?",
        "Todd: Yours truly.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Todd: What's up? You ok?",
        "Blair: Yeah, it's just a headache.",
        "Todd: Hmm. Did you tell Mc Bain that you thought maybe it was --",
        "Blair: Yes, I did and he told me to come by for some tests and said it's stress-related, but it's -- it's gone, see? It just kind of comes and goes.",
        "Todd: Are you sure?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Good, because I have more bad news.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: When I came home from the school, I found Starr in here with Cole.",
        "Blair: Are you kidding me?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: After everything that's happened, she brought him here to the house?",
        "Todd: Yes, and I kicked him out but she really let me have it afterwards. She's really into him, about as into him as --",
        "Blair: I'm into you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Boilermakers?",
        "Bo: Ay, boilermaker -- ahem.",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Bo: Just the one. What are you doing here? I thought you were turning into one of those palace-type guys.",
        "Clint: I was on my way home from Viki's and I saw your car in the parking lot.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm meeting Paige when she gets back from Atlantic City.",
        "Clint: Oh. Is that the reason for the boilermaker?",
        "Bo: Hmm. Big brother, I found out some news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Natalie, you're telling me that the man in this room is my brother, that the -- that the man in this room is John. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I can't. I can't believe it.",
        "Natalie: Ok, and I reacted the same way when someone told me, but, Michael, it's true. That man in there is your brother. He's alive.",
        "Michael: I identified the dy.",
        "Natalie: I know, but the body was so badly burned.",
        "Michael: The st. Jude's medal --",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Michael: The tattoo.",
        "Natalie: It was a partial. There's no way for you to have known.",
        "Michael: His badge was next to the car. His body was next to the car!",
        "Natalie: It's all circumstantial evidence. Look, there were a lot of coincidences that we all read wrong.",
        "Michael: Natalie? I care about you. I care about you a great deal. Don't do this to yourself. Please. I won't let you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Cole and Starr are nothing like you and me.",
        "Blair: Well, why don't you cut her a little slack?",
        "Todd: I'm trying to protect her. 10 to one that little punk's still using steroids. He could've come in here and freaked out like he did at that party. He could've --",
        "Blair: Well, what, raped her like you raped --",
        "Todd: Don't get in my face about it.",
        "Blair: I'm not!",
        "Todd: You know I've changed, completely.",
        "Blair: You have --",
        "Todd: And I hate the man I was and I hate this little punk Cole.",
        "Blair: Well, I hate the fact that Cole is Marty's son. I wish it was anybody else but her.",
        "Todd: No kidding.",
        "Blair: But I think maybe Starr is angry with you because, you know, she forgave you and she expects you to understand if she forgives Cole.",
        "Todd: She hasn't forgiven him. She told me.",
        "Blair: Ok, Todd. What happened at school?",
        "Todd: Oh, exactly what I expected -- principal doesn't want to lose her star quarterback.",
        "Blair: I'll bet.",
        "Todd: And then -- and then Marty comes in and she gives me this sob story about how she's a single mother now and --",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Todd: Struggling to raise a child on her own --",
        "Blair: Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Todd: And blah, blah, blah, and I ruined her life.",
        "Blair: So what happens now?",
        "Todd: I told the principal that if she didn't expel Cole, that I was going to pull Starr out.",
        "Blair: What'd Starr say about that?",
        "Todd: I have no idea -- didn't ask her. It's none of her business as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Blair: Todd, you can't do that to Starr.",
        "Todd: Yes, I can.",
        "Blair: Hey, sweetie? Starr, come down here a minute. What are you thinking?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Blair: Um -- we want to talk to you a minute.",
        "Starr: Maybe you do. Dad just wants to tell me how to feel and what to do.",
        "Todd: Maybe I know what's best for you.",
        "Starr: Maybe you don't and maybe you never have!",
        "Todd: Hey, you watch your tone.",
        "Starr: You think you're the only person in the world who can make mistakes and get away with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: There was no doubt in our minds at the time. We identified the body at the scene. There were no other unidentified victims there. But looking back on that night, I think we -- we made some assumptions, and we could've made a mistake.",
        "Clint: Well, Viki said Natalie seems certain.",
        "Bo: She's in love with the guy. She wants to believe it.",
        "Clint: Sounded stronger than that to me.",
        "Bo: Well, you know, your daughter doesn't back off.",
        "Clint: Let's go sit down.",
        "Bo: You know, when -- when she couldn't get me to listen, you know what she did?",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Bo: She went to John's grave, tried to dig it up herself.",
        "Clint: I hope to god somebody stopped her.",
        "Bo: Yeah, Vincent Jones -- he stopped her.",
        "Clint: Cristian's former manager?",
        "Bo: Yep. That guy is all through this whole thing. He's the first person that suspected at Hugh wasn't Hugh.",
        "Clint: So he went to Natalie?",
        "Bo: Right.",
        "Clint: Hoping for what?",
        "Bo: I don't know. But I've got a request for a D.N.A. sample from the -- the victim that's in the burn unit in Atlantic City. I've also filed for an exhumation order for the body that's buried in John's grave. Now, if it turns out that John is the patient in that Atlantic City hospital, then we have to get a positive I.D. on the body.",
        "Clint: Well, odds are that it's Hugh Hughes, right?",
        "Bo: Hugh and John were both at the station on that day. Maybe John accidentally dropped the medal, maybe Hugh picked it up.",
        "Clint: Does Paige know about any of this?",
        "Bo: No. I don't want to say anything to her until I know something positive one way or the other. It just -- it'd be cruel.",
        "Clint: So you're going to see her tonight, but you got to keep all of this from her, huh? That's good reason, Bo, to limit the boilermakers to one.",
        "Paige: Hey.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Paige: Hi.",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Paige: Hi, Clint.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Paige: I didn't know you'd be here.",
        "Bo: Well, you look happy.",
        "Paige: I am. I got really great news about Hugh tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Natalie? I miss my brother. I miss him every day, and I want more than anything for this to be true. But it's not.",
        "Natalie: The man in that bed has blue eyes. Hugh Hughes had brown eyes.",
        "Michael: Then why is it that you're the only person running around this hospital with this crazy theory?",
        "Natalie: Because nobody wants to admit that they made such a huge mistake, including you. Michael, that is your brother in there. He is alive. Even Vincent Jones saw his blue eyes, he heard him say that his name is John. I mean, could it not be more clear for you?",
        "Michael: Vincent Jones? What does Vincent Jones have to do with any of this?",
        "Natalie: Hugh was a good friend of his.",
        "Michael: Oh. How strange -- a guy like Jones having a friend that's an A.D.A.",
        "Natalie: Well, they went to college together. They were roommates.",
        "Michael: Oh, Jones went to college? What'd he major in -- gangster 101?",
        "Natalie: Vincent saw his blue eyes, he heard the man speak. He heard that man there say that his name was John. We buried Hugh in that grave, Michael. That is your brother. He's alive, and uncle Bo is going to exhume the body. We're going to get D.N.A. testing done and we're going to know the truth soon.",
        "Michael: Johnny? Is that really you in there? Is that really you, bro?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Are you sure you won't stay and have a drink with us?",
        "Clint: I'd like to, but I promised Jessica that I'd look in on my granddaughter while she and Antonio are away, so --",
        "Bo: Kiss Bree for me.",
        "Clint: I will do that. Paige, good night. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Paige: Good night.",
        "Bo: All right. Well, would you like a drink?",
        "Paige: I would like a glass of champagne. I want to celebrate. Things are going really well for Hugh and they look worse and worse for Spencer. This could end up being the best day of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Slow music plays]",
        "Antonio: You don't want to go up to the room?",
        "Jessica: Well, it's not even late, and look -- look at the moon. It's so beautiful.",
        "Antonio: Well, there's moonlight in our room, too -- and a bed.",
        "Jessica: Oh. I am sure that that bed is going to see a lot of action.",
        "Antonio: Hmm.",
        "Jessica: But we can have a drink first.",
        "Antonio: Oh, ok. Well, when did you become such a night person?",
        "Jessica: Well, I guess staying up with Bree.",
        "Antonio: You miss her?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I do.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. You know, you take care of a baby all day long --",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "Antonio: And then, you just keep asking yourself, you know, \"when I am going to have some time to myself?\"",
        "Jessica: And then when you get time to yourself, all you want to do is be with the baby.",
        "Antonio: Would you like to call Nash and ask how Bree is doing?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I would. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Oh. What's the matter -- you don't like your mashed yams, huh? Huh? Come on, you loved your mashed bananas and disgusting cereal this morning. One more try come on, come on. Ah. No, not a chance -- don't like them. All right. You are a lady who knows her mind. Oh. Just like your mama. You know what? When you are old enough, Jessica is going to explain to you how you kind of had two moms. But not unless you're old enough to handle it, I guess, huh? Not that I think I'm old enough to handle it yet. You know, I keep looking at Jessica and seeing stuff which is just straight Tess. Yeah, I know -- I hear you, I hear you. I got to stop doing this. Jessica is not Tess. Jessica is married to Antonio and I need to get a life. Right? Yeah. Ooh. Telephone. Hold on. Don't go anywhere. All right. Ha-ha. Hello?",
        "Jessica: Hi, it's me. How's my girl?",
        "Nash: Oh -- speak of the devil. She's doing great. She just finished her dinner -- didn't like her mashed yams, can't imagine why. Then I'm going to give her a bath and put her to bed.",
        "Jessica: Sounds like you have things under control.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Oh. Sounds like you're somewhere with very beautiful music.",
        "Jessica: Oh, yeah. We love it here. We're having the best time.",
        "Nash: That's great. Don't -- don't rush back for me, all right? I am enjoying every moment I have alone with my daughter.",
        "Jessica: May I say good night to her?",
        "Nash: Yeah. Yeah, of course. Hey. Bree -- Brennan, Bree? It's your mommy. She wants to say good night.",
        "Jessica: Hi, baby girl. It's mom. I miss you so much, but I want you to have the best sleep ever and I love you. And don't you worry -- daddy's going to take great care of you.",
        "Nash: It's a telephone. Normally, people talk through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know you're angry, but you're not allowed to speak to your father like that. You got that?",
        "Starr: I just love you guys. You can call each other every name in the book, but en I say something --",
        "Blair: Ok, ok, ok, ok. We'll start all over, shall we? Sweetheart, your father and I have had such an awful day --",
        "Starr: Did you tell mom that you're transferring me out of my school yet?",
        "Todd: Yes, I mentioned it to her, yes.",
        "Blair: And he also mentioned that after his meeting with Principal Wexler, he came back to the house and Cole was in here with you.",
        "Starr: Yeah, he came to apologize. What was I supposed to do -- slam the door in his face?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: That's exactly right. A kid that's hyped up on drugs -- that's exactly what you do.",
        "Starr: You're the one who went crazy!",
        "Blair: He's your father. What do you expect him to do, Starr?",
        "Starr: Cole doesn't take that stuff anymore.",
        "Todd: Ah, we don't know that till we see the results of the tox screen.",
        "Starr: He was the same guy from Halloween, the one who stood up for me when Britney and her crew made up that stupid slide show about you. I could tell that he really felt bad about what happened.",
        "Todd: Oh, he was trying to get you to keep me from pressing charges.",
        "Starr: You're right because I'm stupid and you know everything.",
        "Blair: Ok. Ok, Starr. Let's just stop a minute. You think that maybe because of what you feel about Cole that you're not seeing the truth here?",
        "Starr: What are you talking about?",
        "Blair: Well, I know that if you care about somebody and you, you like him -- and I know that you like him -- that maybe you're not seeing the mistakes that he's making.",
        "Starr: Are we talking about me or are we talking about you and dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: \"Unlike chardonnay, which has an affinity for oak, riesling is best left unoaked to retain the crisp --\"",
        "[Bree cries]",
        "Nash: \"Fresh, elegant character that makes it a nearly --\" \"Perfect accompaniment for any meal, especially fish.\" Oh.",
        "[Bree whimpers]",
        "Nash: It's ok. Nighty-night. Guess we'll make you a vintner some other day, huh? Ok, ok. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Hi.",
        "Clint: Am I too late?",
        "Nash: No, she's just falling asleep.",
        "Clint: Oh. Should I go?",
        "Nash: No, it's ok. Come on in. Come on in.",
        "Clint: Ok.",
        "Nash: All right. Yeah. So --",
        "Clint: What a beautiful baby.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Surprise, surprise.",
        "Nash: So let me guess -- Jessica and Antonio had you come by to check up on me, huh?",
        "Clint: I'm not going to lie to you, Nash -- yes, they did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Don't change the subject -- this is about you and Cole and what he tried to do to you.",
        "Starr: Mom, I know that taking steroids is dangerous.",
        "Todd: I'm glad to hear you admit that.",
        "Starr: But he told me why he did that -- because he had to win every game for his whole team, for the whole school.",
        "Todd: Is that so?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it is, dad. I saw it with my own eyes.",
        "Blair: Sweetie, he got aggressive with you.",
        "Starr: I know that. It'll probably take me a long time to trust him again.",
        "Todd: You want to see him again?",
        "Starr: Well, mom's still seeing you, isn't she?",
        "Todd: Cut that out. This is not about her and me.",
        "Starr: Oh, it's not? It's always about you! I like a guy and he likes me, and I think to myself, \"finally, someone who gets me. He doesn't listen to what those stupid girls say about you. He doesn't care. None of that matters.\" Everything is good, and then he does something stupid, and I see him for who he is. Now I'm back in my room watching reruns and you guys are out living my life for me.",
        "Todd: Cut the crap. What happened with Cole's mother and me has nothing to do with how I feel about you and Cole.",
        "Starr: Have you ever heard of a double standard?",
        "Todd: What are you talking about?",
        "Starr: You. You are all over Cole, but you know that what you did to his mother was a hell of a lot worse than what Cole did to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Um -- we were just wondering, how is the patient doing?",
        "Nurse: He's still sedated.",
        "Natalie: So his eyes aren't open?",
        "Nurse: No.",
        "Michael: Ok. I'd like to introduce myself. My name is dr. Michael Mc Bain. I'm a surgical resident at Llanview hospital. I was wondering if it would be possible for me to speak with the surgeon that performed the skin grafts?",
        "Nurse: Well, he'll be doing rounds later.",
        "Natalie: Um -- there's a picture in there of a man with a soccer team. Could you get it for me?",
        "Nurse: Why?",
        "Natalie: It's important to me -- please?",
        "Nurse: Oh.",
        "Natalie: You're starting to believe me, aren't you?",
        "Michael: I think that we have to find out one way or another what's going on.",
        "Natalie: Right.",
        "Michael: But I'm still not sure what that answer is, so let me handle this. Do not do anything crazy.",
        "Natalie: Don't worry. I got that out of my system already.",
        "Michael: Ok, I'm a little afraid to ask how.",
        "Natalie: You don't want to know.",
        "Michael: Let's leave it at that.",
        "Natalie: Good idea.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Oh, thank you.",
        "Michael: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- excuse me. Uh -- I'm Natalie Buchanan, this is Dr. Michael Mc Bain. I -- I would like it if you could look at these two pictures here of these two men and tell me which one just came out of surgery -- you know, the man that's lying there in that bed?",
        "Nurse: Why am I doing this?",
        "Natalie: Please. Just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I should have known I'd be watched.",
        "Clint: Just take it easy. If Jessie and Antonio didn't think you could do it, they wouldn't have left the baby with you.",
        "Nash: Of course. I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Clint: Besides, I know that it's hard to take care of yourself and a little baby in a hotel room. And I was just wondering if you needed anything.",
        "Nash: Well, I got a drawer full of diapers, I got a minibar full of formula, and a portable crib. I think I'm ok.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you got the pediatrician's phone number, and -- and Viki's cell phone number, and mine?",
        "Nash: Shh -- written down.",
