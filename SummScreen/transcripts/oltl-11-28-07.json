        "Antonio: Did you forget something?",
        "Talia: Yeah, I did.",
        "Talia: So, um, best move I ever made or worst?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chuck: Can I help you?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I hope so. I'm looking for a young man.",
        "Chuck: Well, that describes a lot of people.",
        "Charlie: Yes, it does. Oh, my God. Ma'am, are you all right? Ma'am?",
        "Chuck: Is she dead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You're not Dorian.",
        "Viki: David. Where did -- where did -- how did you get in here?",
        "David: Well, the door was wide open. I just -- oh, my -- are you wearing clogs?",
        "Viki: Oh, okay. Look, um, I'm sure you're wondering, so I -- I -- I can explain all of this.",
        "David: That's not necessary. I know exactly what's going on here.",
        "Viki: No, you couldn't possibly --",
        "David: Don't you try to spin this. The jig is up, Niki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Wow. You know how long I've been waiting to do that?",
        "Sarah: As long as I've wanted you to?",
        "Cristian: Sorry. I know it took me a little bit to get my head straight.",
        "Sarah: I -- I get why you held back.",
        "Cristian: But I'm not holding back anymore.",
        "Sarah: I'm sorry. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Talia, look, I --",
        "Talia: Actually, could you hold off on answering that question? I -- I want to fill you in on a couple of background details first.",
        "Antonio: Huh -- Talia, it's not like we're working on a case.",
        "Talia: I like you, Antonio -- obviously, a lot. And for a while -- pretty much since I met you, which is stupid because you were married and we work together and you're my boss. But, I couldn't help myself.",
        "Antonio: What about your boyfriend?",
        "Talia: My boyf -- yeah, I made him up.",
        "Antonio: You made Shaun up?",
        "Talia: Well, not him, but him as my boyfriend. I'm crazy.",
        "[Talia chuckles]",
        "Talia: I know I'm crazy. I -- I knew it as soon as \"George\" came out of my mouth, but I wanted to tell you. I -- I just didn't know how to tell you without confessing to my crush.",
        "Antonio: How did Shaun know that --",
        "Talia: Oh, Layla. Layla knew how I felt about you. And she pulled Shaun into it and I was stuck playing along. But then you saw him hitting on that girl at the gym and you defended my honor, which only made me like you more. And it was, you know, the perfect reason to \"break up.\" And somewhere between trick- or-treating with Jamie and the flan and the salsa, I thought, you know, \"go for it,\" and I did, because I am so into you, Antonio. And I know it's a long shot, but if there's any chance, however small -- I mean, do you think you could feel the same way about me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: She's alive, but I don't know what's wrong with her.",
        "Chuck: She probably got drunk and passed out.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. You know who this is?",
        "Chuck: Yep. She's got a lot to drink about, too.",
        "Charlie: She doesn't smell like booze, but I -- here, she's coming to.",
        "Dorian: Oh. What --",
        "Charlie: Ma'am? Can you hear me? You know what your name is?",
        "Dorian: Yes. My name is Dorian Lord.",
        "Charlie: Do you know where you are, Ms. Lord?",
        "Dorian: It's Dr. Lord.",
        "Charlie: Do you know where you are?",
        "Dorian: Yes -- the Godforsaken Buchanan ranch.",
        "Charlie: Yeah -- I think she's going to be okay. We should get her inside just to be sure.",
        "Dorian: No! I'm never going in that house again.",
        "Chuck: Well, everyone pulled up stakes and went home. It's empty.",
        "Charlie: What, everybody?",
        "Chuck: Everybody. It's just me and the hands.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no! I'm such a mess.",
        "Chuck: Well, lying in the bushes will do that to you.",
        "Charlie: Do you know what happened? I mean, have you been drinking? Did you take anything?",
        "Dorian: No, absolutely not.",
        "Charlie: Wow. Maybe you had some kind of fit.",
        "Dorian: It's called a seizure. I'm a doctor. I would know if I had a seizure.",
        "Charlie: Well -- so you have no idea how you ended up out here like this?",
        "Dorian: No. Oh.",
        "Charlie: Boy, you must've hit your head when you fell. Are you in a lot of pain?",
        "Dorian: Hmm. My head is throbbing -- hmm -- and my ankle is a bit sore.",
        "Charlie: You might've sprained it, and you might have a concussion.",
        "Chuck: You're just lucky we found you. You could've died of exposure out here or gotten run over.",
        "Dorian: I did. Someone hit me with a car -- someone blond.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: David, I'm not --",
        "David: Oh, save it, Niki. I'd know you anywhere -- the trailer-trash getup. All that's missing is a wad of chewing gum, which you probably swallowed as soon as I walked in here.",
        "Viki: I am not Niki Smith. Do I sound like Niki?",
        "David: Amusing -- Niki acting like Viki acting like Niki.",
        "Viki: Stop this!",
        "David: You are a horrible actress. What are you going to do? You going to try to jump my bones just like you did the last time you came out to play? Huh? I want you to know something -- I have way too much respect for Viki to let a gutter tramp like you have your way with me.",
        "Viki: How dare -- listen, I am not Niki Smith -- oh!",
        "David: Come on, Viki. I know you're in there somewhere. Look what this floozy has you doing now -- nickel and diming it le a truck stop hooker waitress. Fight it!",
        "Viki: David!",
        "David: With all the blue, patrician blood you have in you, fight it, I say!",
        "Viki: Stop it! This is ridiculous.",
        "David: Not on your Yankee pot roast. You're coming with me, you trollop.",
        "Viki: I am not going anywhere with you!",
        "Noelle: Ah! Oh, my God -- I killed him!",
        "Noelle: I didn't mean to kill him! It was an accident! I -- I was trying to defend you, Viki.",
        "Viki: It's all right -- he's not dead.",
        "Noelle: Oh.",
        "Viki: You didn't kill him -- he's just out cold.",
        "Noelle: Is he going to be all right?",
        "Viki: Yes, I'm sure he will be. Look, straighten his legs out, okay?",
        "Noelle: Oh. I just came back here to practice my pie crust in the kitchen and I heard the commotion, and then I see you being manhandled by the same guy you were hiding from the other day! Next thing I know, I've got a skillet in my hand and I'm going to the pokey.",
        "Viki: No, no, no, you're not going anywhere. You're going home and you're going to forget this ever happened, okay?",
        "Noelle: Well, well -- I can't leave you here with this creep. What's he going to do to you when he comes to?",
        "Viki: Noelle, I know this guy, all right? He's about as dangerous as a sponge.",
        "David: Sponge --",
        "Viki: You know what? You got to get out of here before he wakes up and decides to press charges against you. Off you go -- go home, go home. Go, go.",
        "Viki: Okay, David? David? David!",
        "David: Ah -- oh! Ah! Oh! What hit me?",
        "[David groans]",
        "Viki: Look, I'm going to get you an ice pack, but you -- first, you have to tell me something. Do I have to worry about Dorian showing up here, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Stop fussing! I have a little sprain, that's all. A little bump on the head -- it's nothing to be concerned about.",
        "Charlie: Well, that's what I thought until you said that you'd been hit by a car.",
        "Dorian: Maybe I was hit by a car.",
        "Charlie: You said that --",
        "Dorian: It all happened so fast, I can't be sure.",
        "Chuck: Well, you sounded pretty sure when you said it was a blond who hit you.",
        "Dorian: It's so easy to blame things on a blond. Whatever, whoever was responsible -- believe me, it's nothing that a ride to the airport won't fix.",
        "Charlie: Well, now, hold on.",
        "Chuck: All right, well, I'll go get you some aspirin.",
        "Dorian: Oh, young man, make it ibuprofen -- thank you.",
        "Charlie: Look, I still think you should see a doctor.",
        "Dorian: It's not necessary. I'm a doctor.",
        "Charlie: I heard you the first time, but you can't diagnose yourself. You were unconscious for a while, you know?",
        "Dorian: I'm not going to let some backwoods E.R. attending go poking and prodding.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Dorian: You're just going to have to make the diagnosis.",
        "Charlie: Ma'am, I'm not a doctor.",
        "Dorian: I will guide you through it step by step. Excuse me -- is that a flashlight on your key chain?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Good. All right. Aim it into my eyes -- please -- and then tell me, are both my pupils equally dilated",
        "Charlie: Yes, they are.",
        "Dorian: Good. Now, hold up any amount of fingers. Two. It's 2007, my name is Dorian Lord, and yours would be?",
        "Charlie: Well -- you can call me Charlie.",
        "Dorian: Charlie. All right. Now, Charlie, I do not want you to get the wrong idea, but -- ahem -- take your hand and just press into my stomach.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm --",
        "Dorian: If I feel any pain --",
        "Charlie: Not going to do that.",
        "Dorian: Relax!",
        "Charlie: I --",
        "Dorian: Charlie -- Charlie? Just feel me up, baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What? Am I off my game here or -- no good? Too good?",
        "Sarah: Really good. I haven't been kissed like that in -- ever.",
        "Cristian: Okay, so what am I missing here? I mean, you are into this?",
        "Sarah: I am so into this, I can't even tell you. But -- are you, the same way that I am?",
        "Cristian: Well, I don't know what you've heard about me, but I don't go around kissing random people just for the hell of it -- not like that, anyway.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, but were you kissing me like that because it's me, or because Evangeline's not here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Listen to me. You're -- you're fun. You're funny, you -- you make me laugh, which is really, really hard to do these days and -- and you're smart and beautiful. Jamie's crazy about you, which counts -- which counts for a lot with me. And -- and you've -- you've been a great friend for both Jamie and -- and me.",
        "Talia: \"Friend.\" Okay.",
        "Antonio: You're brave, putting yourself on the line like that. And -- and you definitely can kiss.",
        "Talia: But what?",
        "Antonio: I'm going to hate myself for saying this, but I -- I -- I can't.",
        "Talia: Okay. Fine. It's cool. I get it. It's okay.",
        "Antonio: No, um -- I -- I don't think you do. Look, we work together.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Antonio: There's that, and -- but it's -- it's more.",
        "Talia: You know what? Everybody's not attracted to each other. It's fine.",
        "Antonio: Look, I -- I'm just not ready yet -- for anybody.",
        "Talia: Right. You've been hurt. I got it.",
        "Antonio: I went through hell for Jessica, okay, and she fell in love with somebody else. I just don't know if I'm able to trust another woman, let -- let alone my own feelings. I mean, this --",
        "Talia: You could trust me.",
        "Antonio: I know. I know. It's -- it's up here, really. I mean, it's not you personally and -- and I'm -- I'm sorry. I should've said something sooner.",
        "Talia: What are you talking about? How long have you known that I had feelings for you?",
        "Antonio: It -- it doesn't matter.",
        "Talia: It does to me. How long?",
        "Antonio: I've suspected for a while now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chuck: How's the patient doing?",
        "Charlie: She's the doctor.",
        "Chuck: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Charlie and I have bonded. We're in complete agreement -- it's just a slight sprain and a mild concussion and nothing to be too concerned about. However, I will get a second opinion once I get back to Llanview. I hope that's satisfactory to the two of you.",
        "Chuck: I'll get you a cab right away.",
        "Dorian: Great.",
        "Charlie: I still think I should wrap that ankle or something.",
        "Dorian: No, no, not necessary.",
        "Charlie: Well, here -- water or Texas cure-all?",
        "Dorian: Ooh, no, no, no, no, no. Water to take the pills. Bourbon wouldn't be good with a concussion. Ah. However, comes in handy if you're suffering from some deep loss or devastating humiliation.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, so I've heard. You sure you don't want me to wrap that ankle? You look like you're in pain.",
        "Dorian: This isn't pain. This is outrage. I am so outraged, I could just throttle somebody.",
        "Charlie: Well, I would want to do that, too, if I'd been run over.",
        "Dorian: No, it's not that.",
        "Charlie: What, it's worse than that?",
        "Dorian: I loved a man with all my heart, and he cheated on me. And then he had the audacity to break up with me because I went to bed with somebody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: All right, all right -- we'll do this your way, Viki. You don't need to worry about Dorian, by the way. If she wasn't here when I showed up, she's not making an appearance.",
        "Viki: Why were you looking for her here in the first place?",
        "David: Just a long shot. But I guess it's a relief to you, isn't it, Nik?",
        "Viki: David, if I were Niki Smith, would I be ministering to your thick skull?",
        "David: Point well taken.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Besides, look at my uniform -- it says \"Viki.\"",
        "David: Well, if you are Viki, what are you doing here slumming it in some roadside truck stop? Not very Viki-like.",
        "Viki: I could explain it to you, but I don't think you would understand.",
        "David: Try me. And don't lie because I'm smart.",
        "Viki: Okay. David, my life here is about reinventing myself.",
        "David: So you're reinventing yourself by handing out the blue-plate special?",
        "Viki: Oh, come on -- I told you you wouldn't understand.",
        "David: Well, you know what? You're right -- I don't, because I've been trying to reinvent myself, too, but only because I didn't have a choice. You're somebody who's got everything.",
        "Viki: That's the whole point. I started wondering what if I didn't have, you know, the house and the money and the paper and everything else? Would there still be a person left? So, I took it all away.",
        "David: What'd you find?",
        "Viki: David, if you work a minimum-wage job, you have very few choices in your life -- they're made for you. You don't go to the grocery store and decide what to buy -- you buy what's on sale. You don't choose between going to a movie or watching TV because television is free.",
        "David: So, discovering that television is free gave you what?",
        "Viki: David, you know, I -- I realized that I could live like this. I don't need the servants and the house and the money -- I don't. And it's not half bad.",
        "David: Hmm. Have you asked the people that you work with here if they feel the same way?",
        "Viki: Okay, I realize that I am just visiting this life, okay? But I'm very glad I've done it because I learned a lot about myself and I've made incredible friends.",
        "David: Do they know that they're slinging hash with one of the richest women in the U.S.?",
        "Viki: David, they don't know anything about me and I would like to keep it that way, okay?",
        "David: How do you think that they would feel if they found out that you were scamming them this whole time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Talia --",
        "Talia: This is really humiliating.",
        "Antonio: No.",
        "Talia: I made up a boyfriend -- huh. I had a guy I barely know pose as him. I mean, what am I -- 14?",
        "Antonio: I might have done the same thing.",
        "Talia: Please don't try to make me feel better.",
        "Antonio: Look, I'm sorry. I -- I -- I should've told you right away.",
        "Talia: Yeah -- why didn't you?",
        "Antonio: Because I -- because I wasn't sure at first. I mean, I didn't want to come off as arrogant.",
        "Talia: Oh. But when you put it together, you thought \"hopefully, she'll get over it so that I won't have to say anything to her?\" So, oh, my God!",
        "Antonio: No, no.",
        "Talia: Oh, my God!",
        "Antonio: I liked it.",
        "Talia: What?",
        "Antonio: The -- the -- the joking, the -- the flirting. It was -- it was nice to be wanted by somebody -- by you. I'm just not ready yet -- for anybody. Look, I -- I'm -- I'm sorry. I -- I hope you can understand because I -- I -- I really do want you in my life and I -- I want to be able to work together and -- and I like our friendship and I want to remain friends and -- are you okay with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: There's nothing left between Evangeline and me.",
        "Sarah: Cristian, I saw you tonight -- when Layla was talking about Evangeline.",
        "Cristian: Well, she's hurt and she's in a coma. Can't -- can't I care about how she's doing?",
        "Sarah: Are you kidding me? That's one of the reasons that you're somebody that I want to be with. A lot of other guys would've forgotten about her.",
        "Cristian: I'll never do that.",
        "Sarah: Because you still love her.",
        "Cristian: Yeah -- of course I love her. You know, no matter what's happened, we -- we were close, and things like that don't go away.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, but it's more than that. You're in love with her. You're still waiting for her.",
        "Cristian: No, no. Evangeline and I aren't going to happen.",
        "Sarah: You don't even know, do you?",
        "Cristian: Know what?",
        "Sarah: The way you are when you talk about her. Anybody can tell. You're not like that about anything or anyone else -- it's all Evangeline.",
        "Cristian: Look, Sarah, I told you -- Evangeline and I were over before she went into that coma.",
        "Sarah: But you invited her to your place the night she got hurt. You wanted her back. Admit it.",
        "Cristian: Well, maybe I did -- then.",
        "Sarah: But if Evangeline didn't get hurt, you would still be with her now, wouldn't you?",
        "Cristian: Will you stop with this? Look, I'm here, I'm -- I'm kissing you. That's what is.",
        "Sarah: But Evangeline is not gone. She could get better. You have to think about that every day. I need to know -- if Evangeline woke up, what would you do?",
        "Sarah: Think about it, Cristian. If Evangeline came out of her coma, how would you feel?",
        "Cristian: I'd be happy as hell.",
        "Sarah: Well, that's a given, but would you be happy as a friend, or more than that? Okay. That answers that.",
        "Cristian: I didn't say anything, Sarah.",
        "Sarah: No, no, you said -- you've said a lot.",
        "Cristian: All right, listen, have you heard the expression \"dead to the world\"? Because that was me, like, for real. Evangeline found me, and she told me that she could give me my life back. And she did. You know, she fought till she made that happen, and I'm never going to forget that, ever.",
        "Sarah: I don't know how a spoiled little rich girl rock star wannabe can compare to that.",
        "Cristian: Come on, Sarah, I don't see you that way, I don't.",
        "Sarah: Sure you do. You know what? We just kissed. It's not like we're going out or anything.",
        "Cristian: Listen, I want to be honest with you, but I don't want to hurt you, either.",
        "Sarah: Trust me; this is so far from hurt. It's okay, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Are you sure?",
        "Sarah: I swear. I mean, I'm just glad we got all this out in the open right now. I mean, think about if it were three months down the road. All that screaming and yelling. One of us would have had to quit the club, and it wouldn't be me. So look, we saved you a job and a perfectly good friendship.",
        "Cristian: If that's the way you want it.",
        "Sarah: We really are better off this way. I mean, what were we thinking, huh?",
        "Cristian: I'm not exactly sure.",
        "Sarah: So, we better say good night before we do something stupid. See you at work.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. I'll see you.",
        "Layla: Everything okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I -- I'm sorry if -- if I've hurt you.",
        "Talia: Oh, it takes a lot more than that. And besides, it was just -- it was a crush. It was a little crush. It was like a crush-ette. Crush-lite. You know? And I -- I said it out loud, and it's -- I'm fine. I mean, I'm already over it. It's fine.",
        "Antonio: Thanks -- for being so -- so understanding.",
        "Talia: Well, what's there to understand, you know? You're not ready, you're not ready. It's fine.",
        "Antonio: So we're good?",
        "Talia: We're good. We're more than good.",
        "Antonio: I'm glad.",
        "Talia: Wow, it's probab-- yep. It's really late, so I have to go to sleep. But I will see you at work. So goodbye.",
        "Antonio: Good night, Talia.",
        "Talia: Good night.",
        "Talia: Oh.",

        "David: How would your new circle of minimum-wage earners feel if they found out you were playing the simple life -- without Nicole and Paris by your side? Do you think they'd say \"Aw, shucks, that's okay. Let's go bake a pie\"? Or would they feel that they've been had by you?",
        "Viki: David, I have not done anyone any harm, okay? What are you going to do, blackmail me?",
        "David: Well, I told you I'm trying to turn over a new leaf, but yes, you should probably take that as a threat.",
        "Viki: Don't you dare!",
        "David: Well, don't you force me to throw a monkey wrench into your new journey of self-spiritualization. Look, I am serious when I say that I am trying to change. For example, do I need to remind you that I selflessly returned Clint's $10 million?",
        "Viki: \"Selflessly\"? David, I said I was never going to speak to you again.",
        "David: Behold the power that you have over me. David Vickers got a job.",
        "Viki: Yes, I know you did. The resort in Martinique.",
        "David: Oh, you got my post card?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Is that where you met up with your lovely wife?",
        "David: Yeah, we had a really classy ceremony where we both wore matching white tracks -- how'd you know about that?",
        "Viki: Huh. I was -- I was actually here earlier, and I overheard you and Alex and Dorian talking. Ahem.",
        "David: And you didn't say hello?",
        "Viki: Tell me something -- how does your marrying Alex Olanov fit into your search for enlightenment?",
        "David: Well, it enlightened me to the fact that I don't like to work. Plus, Alex always seems happier when she's married, so I threw her a bone.",
        "Viki: David, she's a gold digger!",
        "David: That's what I was hoping to do, but it didn't pan out.",
        "Viki: Why, how much is she worth?",
        "David: $56 in checking.",
        "Viki: Oh! Ho!",
        "David: And about a jillion in hock.",
        "Viki: Oh, David --",
        "David: So here I am, stuck in the boonies, the middle of nowhere without two nickels to rub together. But that doesn't matter now, does it? Not when you've got friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: See, I never would have slept with my ex if I hadn't seen this man kissing this slut.",
        "Charlie: You caught him with a hooker?",
        "Dorian: No, actually, she passes herself off as a pillar of the community, but it doesn't matter! The fact is, I was so outraged, I couldn't see straight, let alone think straight. And there, suddenly, was my ex, with open arms, and -- well, what was I supposed to do?",
        "Charlie: Well, I -- I wasn't there myself, so --",
        "Dorian: Charlie, I think that you are a very nice man. And I like you, even if you are a friend of the Buchanans.",
        "Charlie: Ma'am, I don't even know the Buchanans.",
        "Dorian: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Charlie: I'm looking for someone, one of their guests, but this guy, Chuck, told me that they'd all left.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you are so in luck. I happen to be very familiar with the entire tribe. You've been so nice to me. Let me return the favor. Who exactly are you looking for?",
        "Dorian: Yes, he was here.",
        "Charlie: You're sure of that?",
        "Dorian: Positive. He probably went back to Llanview when everybody else left.",
        "Charlie: What, Llanview?",
        "Dorian: Pennsylvania. That's where most of the Buchanans and their posse make their homes.",
        "Charlie: Well, I guess I'm just going to have to go there, then.",
        "Dorian: Me, too. And come to think of it, after everything that's happened, I am not going to fly commercial. Ooh, no. I am going to charter a plane -- and reserve a seat for you.",
        "Charlie: Oh, you know, I'm afraid I can't afford to chip in on that.",
        "Dorian: No, it's my treat.",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Well, you saved my life. It's the least I can do for you.",
        "Charlie: I thought you said you weren't that bad off.",
        "Dorian: I lied. Anyway, aren't you in a big hurry? Why waste time with a layover when you could be in Llanview in a few hours -- and find that person you're looking for?",
        "Charlie: All right. I appreciate that.",
        "Dorian: I'm not just doing it for you.",

        "Viki: You need my help.",
        "David: Well, I hate to ask --",
        "Viki: Yeah, like when has that ever stopped you?",
        "David: You know, cash might be easier on both of us, but if necessary, you can write me a personal check.",
        "Viki: Do I look like an A.T.M.?",
        "David: No, you don't.",
        "Viki: Okay. Don't fall back on bad habits, David.",
        "David: Well, you know, desperate times --",
        "Viki: No, no, you've been in worse situations -- like last summer, and look what you did. You applied yourself, you got a job, you made an honest living.",
        "David: I was happier marrying Alex. Sorry.",
        "Viki: Did -- did you seriously think that was going to work?",
        "David: Well, I figured it was probably a long shot, given her fondness for chrome-dome mobsters and septuagenarians.",
        "Viki: You know, if you're really in such a bad situation, you could always go knocking on Dorian's door, right?",
        "David: Well, what do you think I'm doing here? She had the hots for your boss' bouillabaisse recipe, so --",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "David: I figured maybe she stopped off here to refuel before she headed back to Llanview, because she was fleeing Asa's ranch.",
        "Viki: \"Fleeing\"? Why?",
        "David: Dorian and Clint had a little misunderstanding.",
        "Viki: Oh, what a pity. Hmm.",
        "David: So she's probably halfway back to Llanview now.",
        "Viki: Poor Llanview.",
        "David: So what about you?",
        "Viki: What about me?",
        "David: You remember Llanview, right? Pennsylvania? Home to everything that you call near and dear?",
        "Viki: David, I'm perfectly happy where I am now.",
        "David: Really?",
        "Viki: Hmm. Now, what are you going to do now?",
        "David: I don't know. I guess I could follow Dorian back to Llanview, but I don't think she wants to see me right now.",
        "Viki: Well, I'll tell you what. There's a little motel across the street, the Bon Suites. It's not bad.",
        "David: You're suggesting that I stay at that dive?",
        "Viki: You know, David, once you get past the no minibar and no room service, it's quite charming.",
        "David: Do they he a pool where people can watch me lay out?",
        "Viki: Oh \u0096",

        "Layla: I think it's his choice to make, and it sounds like you did it for him.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: I don't know Antonio very well, but that doesn't sound like him.",
        "Layla: I got to know him pretty well when I was working for him, and he doesn't play games.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Antonio sighs]",
        "Cristian: Sometimes, it feels good to be out of the game.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, I'm not ready to jump back in yet.",
        "Cristian: Trouble is, what if the right woman comes along before you're ready?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Antonio is still not over Jessica.",

        "Sarah: Uh-uh. We're talking about you and Antonio here.",
        "Layla: Antonio's just in a weird place right now. He's going to finally get it together and kick his own butt for letting you slip through his fingers. And you know what will happen then, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Your situation's different than mine.",
        "Cristian: You know what? I realized something tonight. I'm done being alone. What about you?",
