        "Tomas is missing and both Blair and Tea are worried and call John. Natalie finds out from her mom that Todd is devastated after Blair has decided she wants to be with Tomas instead of him. And she puts two and two together remarking to Viki that it's very coincidental that Tomas goes missing right after Todd reveals his unwillingness to let Blair move on with Tomas. Todd seems riddled with guilt. But it seems he has successfully implemented his plan to make Tomas disappear and possibly get charged with the murder of Victor when John finds the gun in question right in Tomas' dresser drawer.",
        "Matthew goes into cardiac arrest. Bo and Nora are both afraid he's gone. But the doctors rush in to revive him. And surprisingly, he awakens and appears to be ok. Destiny is with her family who argue amongst themselves about whether Vivian should marry Shaun. She somehow knows she has to go and see Matthew so she meets Bo and Nora right when Matthew opens his eyes. Yet, something they all forget is that he is unaware that she has been pregnant by him since he went into his coma."

        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] I got his voicemail. You know, he's had quite a week himself. Maybe he hasn't even listened to his messages. And you know what? Let's go down to the station. What do you think?",

        "Tom\u00e1s: Yes. Are you thinking clearly? Are you? I know you've been through a lot of trauma.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Thanks to you. You're a cold-blooded killer. I know it. You know it. As soon as your fingerprints are on this gun, the whole world's gonna know it.",

And most of all, we are so grateful that you have brought our wonderful Destiny home to us again. We are grateful for the roof over our heads.

        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry. [Sighs] How are the kids? Did they ask about him while I was out here?",
        "Blair: No. You know, Dani and Jack, I think, bought the whole \"New York City gallery\" thing, and Sam, he's too young. He really doesn't care.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] Starr got quiet. I saw her looking at you.",
        "Blair: Well, Starr always knows when something is wrong. Hope went into her whole majorette thing. They're in there watching the parade again on DVR.",

        "John: No, it doesn't, but --",
        "Natalie: And I-I don't expect that. I-in fact, I-I don't have any assumptions about what's going to happen. And don't worry. I-I don't -- I don't think that we could have a future after what I did. But we do share a son, and I really think that we can raise him without any drama.",

        "Todd: Yeah, I bet everybody missed me.",
        "Viki: Mm.",
        "Todd: You have people for that.",
        "Viki: No, Lois and Nigel, they take care of the house. They're not babysitters.",
        "Todd: Tell that to Jessica's kids.",
        "Viki: So, what's wrong?",
        "Todd: Nothing. Oh, I'm not fooling you with my sunny disposition?",
        "Viki: Just tell me what's wrong. What happened? Did you do something --",
        "Todd: Tom\u00e1s Delgado.",
        "Viki: Tom\u00e1s? That's T\u00e9a's brother.",
        "Todd: Yes, Viki. Tom\u00e1s Delgado is, in fact, T\u00e9a Delgado's brother.",
        "Viki: Okay. What happened? Is there trouble between you two?",
        "Todd: Nope. No trouble.",
        "Viki: Okay, we are not doing this again.",
        "Todd: What is it we're not doing again?",
        "Viki: You know, if you take everything that's bothering you and just shove it under the rug, you know what happens? You disappear and nothing is left but a smokescreen. So, just tell me what's wrong.",
        "Todd: I can ask you anything, right, Viki? Can I ask you something?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Todd: If you don't want me to sweep this under the rug, where do you want me to put it?",
        "Viki: I am sorely tempted to tell you exactly where you can put it.",
        "Todd: I dare you.",
        "Viki: You know I'm not going to stop asking, so you might as well tell me. What is up with Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Todd: He's with Blair now. They're together.",
        "Viki: Together?",
        "Todd: Yep. Together. You see, Viki, when a man and a woman love each other very much --",
        "Viki: Shut up. How do you know that for sure?",
        "Todd: She made me realize what I want. And I want you. I just do.",
        "Viki: Todd.",
        "Todd: It's a fact. Blair chose Tom\u00e1s. I missed my chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, John's on his way, so everything's gonna be okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't know that.",
        "Blair: Yes, I do. It's John. He will make sure it's taken care of, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: What if he says, \"I'm not a cop anymore. This isn't my problem,\" huh?",
        "Blair: That is not John. He wouldn't be on his way over here if he didn't feel that he could help. You need to eat a little something. You ate like a bird.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ugh, I can't.",
        "Blair: Come on. Yes, you can. T\u00e9a, you're pregnant. You got to remember that.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] Blair, I keep thinking, what am I gonna tell this kid? I mean, I already have to explain why their father isn't around. Now with Tom\u00e1s gone, I --",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. You know what? Stop thinking like that. Tom\u00e1s is coming home, all right? He made a lot of promises that he has to keep.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're just as worried as I am. Admit it.",
        "Blair: You know what I keep thinking? I just don't know why I waited so long to tell him how I felt about him.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What did Blair want?",
        "John: Oh, Tom\u00e1s is missing. He went looking for Victor's murderer and didn't show up at Thanksgiving and no one's heard from him.",
        "Natalie: That doesn't sound good.",
        "John: Hey, who knows with that guy? You know, maybe that's how he works.",
        "Natalie: Well, what's Blair want you to do? You're not on the force.",
        "John: Oh, she didn't seem to care. I said I'd call the station for her.",
        "Natalie: She wants you, not a cop.",
        "John: Yeah, I guess, but, uh, I'm not going. I'm --",
        "[Liam cries]",
        "John: Hey. Why's the little guy crying?",
        "Natalie: [Laughs] Because he's awake and no one's paying attention to him.",
        "John: Well, you know what? I can fix that.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs] Wait, wait. Um, you know, why don't you let me take care of Liam, you go take care of Blair?",
        "John: Yeah? You sure?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we have plenty of time to talk about this. Just be safe.",
        "John: Okay. I'll be back fast, okay? Um, take care of our son.",
        "[Liam cooing]",
        "Natalie: \"Our son.\" I like it.",

        "Shaun: Don't you want your pie?",
        "Vivian: Oh, no. This fork is not touching my lips until you eat first.",
        "Shaun: Mom, didn't we forget the prayer tree?",
        "Mrs. Evans: Vivian, he is playing with you. I made the cherry for you.",
        "Vivian: That is my favorite.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Well, Shaun said.",
        "Destiny: Uh, may I be excused?",
        "Mr. Evans: You haven't touched your dessert.",
        "Destiny: I know, but the next train to Philly leaves in half an hour. If I leave now, I can just make it.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Are Bo and Nora there?",
        "Destiny: Yeah, they were gonna be with Matthew all day today.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Well, why don't you take them a pie? I'm sure they couldn't have had much of a dinner at the hospital.",
        "Destiny: Thanks.",
        "Mrs. Evans: I'll pack one up.",
        "Shaun: Little D, why didn't you tell me you wanted to go to Philly? I could have taken you before.",
        "Destiny: I don't know. I was gonna wait until tomorrow, but I just feel like I have to go now. Um, maybe it's 'cause it's Thanksgiving, but I just want to be close to Matthew today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hey, honey. Can you hear us?",
        "Doctor: Page Dr. Claremont. I need a reflex hammer and get me a kit.",
        "Bo: Doctor. What just happened here?",
        "Doctor: We got lucky.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but is it temporary or -- we've been through all of this before. Matthew woke up, and then we thought he was fine. Are we gonna lose him again?",
        "Nora: Oh. I am so happy to see those eyes. Oh, sweetheart. Hi,",
        "Doctor: I can't say, Mr. Buchanan. We should know more after we do the tests. Until then, let's just take it one step at a time. Thanks. Matthew, I need to ask you some questions, okay? Do you know where you are?",
        "Matthew: Looks like the hospital.",
        "Bo: He hasn't been conscious since we brought him in.",
        "Doctor: You know who these people are?",
        "Matthew: My mom and dad. I already said that.",
        "Doctor: That's right. You did. And who's the president?",
        "Matthew: That depends on how long I was out. Is it still Obama?",
        "Nora: Mm. Yes. Yes, it is. All right. We'll make this quick. You haven't seen light in a long time. Probably wasn't too much fun.",
        "Matthew: It's a lot funner than sleeping.",
        "Nora: Yes, it is. [Chuckles]",
        "Doctor: Well, Matthew, you seem to be doing pretty well. Your reflexes and your cognitive skills look good. You caught us all by surprise here, so we're gonna have to do a lot of tests in the next few hours. This may sound funny after all that sleep, but all you need to do now is rest, all right? Take it slow.",
        "Matthew: Okay.",
        "Bo: Doctor. [Clears throat] How long will he be awake? [Sighs] I really don't have an answer.",
        "Bo: When will you get one?",
        "Doctor: Believe me, this is the kind of breakthrough where everyone will want to know the whys and hows. I'm just gonna look at Matthew's last CT scan. If anything changes, page me.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "Doctor: If it looks like he's deteriorating at all, get me up here. Don't wait.",
        "Nora: Don't worry.",
        "Doctor: I'll be in radiology. Page me.",
        "Bo: We will.",
        "Nora: Nothing's gonna go wrong. I know it. Honey, he's, like, the best doctor in the country for your condition. That's -- that's why we brought you here.",
        "Matthew: Where?",
        "Nora: In Philadelphia. That's where you are. This is where we knew you'd have the best chance.",
        "Bo: Your mom would never give up, Matthew, no matter what they said.",
        "Matthew: What -- what --",
        "Nora: You were really sick, sweetie. And I'm sure you probably can feel it now, but you're getting better, and you're gonna keep getting better. No one's gonna give up on you, not until you're up and walking around on your own two feet.",
        "Matthew: How long was I out?",
        "Bo: You, uh... you were unconscious for six months.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: So then it looks like we're all just gonna go home.",
        "Vivian: But then the best man proposes to the maid of honor, or the woman that was supposed to be the maid of honor.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Wait. Who -- who, now?",
        "Shaun: Cord Roberts, Clint's son, lives in London.",
        "Vivian: Yeah, uh, Tina Lord.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Oh! I know who that is.",
        "Shaun: How's that, Mom?",
        "Mr. Evans: You know she watches \"Access Llanview\" whenever I'm not home.",
        "Shaun: Anyway, we still got a wedding.",
        "Mr. Evans: On the spot.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Now, how do two people get married on five seconds' notice?",
        "Vivian: Well, uh, Viki called in some favors to Senator Lord, and they got the marriage license there within the hour.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Must be nice to know someone. Well, maybe this marriage will last. It's craziness.",
        "Shaun: They've had some practice being married to each other. And two kids.",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, maybe they'll get it right this time.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Mm. That family.",
        "Shaun: What does that mean?",
        "Mrs. Evans: Oh, those Buchanan girls. See, this is what happens when you get married on a whim. They should have taken the time to get to know each other.",
        "Shaun: Natalie knew Brody -- she thought.",
        "Mrs. Evans: They weren't even together six months. No, they should have taken their time.",
        "Shaun: How much time is that?",
        "Mrs. Evans: I don't know. You and Vivian have been together for about two years now. Seems like a perfect time to get engaged.",
        "Shaun: Don't look at me. Ask Vivian about that.",
        "Vivian: [Chuckles nervously] Shaun... why don't we, um, talk about this later?",
        "Mrs. Evans: Oh. See, that's just not how it works, doll. So, what am I supposed to be asking?",
        "Vivian: Well, Shaun and I had a very long talk about marriage, which just isn't for me.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Oh.",
        "Mr. Evans: Oh, Lord.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Not for you? So, what do you want?",
        "Vivian: Well, I'm -- I'm happy with the way that things are.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Where you can just be free to see whoever you want?",
        "Vivian: No, I'm with Shaun. I just want to make sure that we don't do anything that we might regret.",
        "Mrs. Evans: I see. So, it seems like you're saying you're fine with Shaun -- for now. Maybe. But he isn't good enough to marry?",
        "Viki: Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I know this must be breaking your heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What heart?",
        "Viki: The heart that I know is there, that needed healing. I wanted this so much for -- for you.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Choose carefully, Todd. What you do next will define you for the rest of your life. Either you become the man that Viki, Starr, T\u00e9a, and Blair want you to become... or you prove that you are truly your mother's son -- nothing but a psychopathic murderer.",
        "Viki: Listen, it doesn't mean it can't still happen, you know? Come on.",
        "Natalie: Sorry.",
        "Todd: You're not the one that needs to be sorry. Your mom, you know her. She can't -- she gets all mushy after all that turkey.",
        "Natalie: I'm just gonna go grab a drink.",
        "Viki: I thought you and John were in the library.",
        "Natalie: Uh, yeah. Yeah, we were. Uh, and then he got a call from Blair and had to run out. Apparently, Tom\u00e1s Delgado is missing.",

        "John: How long has Tom\u00e1s been gone?",
        "T\u00e9a: He left the house yesterday around 4:00 p.m.",
        "John: 4:00 p.m. and this had something to do with Victor's murder?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Absolutely it did.",
        "Blair: Otherwise he would be here.",
        "John: Okay. Well, it's too soon to file an official missing-persons report. I'll see what I can do unofficially.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you.",
        "John: So, who was the last person to see Tom\u00e1s?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, I-I was the last person to see him. He told me nothing about where he was going, what he was doing.",
        "Blair: He didn't tell me anything. Of course, if we knew where he was, who he was looking for, we would actually know where to look.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Bo: Well, we can rule out Irene Manning.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "Bo: Yeah. She'd be right at the top of the list if she wasn't locked up when all this happened.",
        "John: Doesn't mean she didn't arrange it.",
        "Bo: But I don't see how. I mean, she was under constant observation. There was nothing to indicate that she was able to smuggle out any kind of message. During the whole buildup to this, uh, Victor Lord murder, she only had contact with one other person, and that was her other son, Todd.",

        "Natalie: I don't know, but T\u00e9a and Blair seem pretty worried.",
        "Viki: So, what happened?",
        "Natalie: I don't have all the details, but apparently Tom\u00e1s was chasing a-a lead on Victor's killer, never came home last night, and no one's heard from him.",
        "Todd: So, what was the lead?",
        "Natalie: John's on his way there. He'll find out.",

        "T\u00e9a: Um, he actually doesn't have many friends around here. But you tried his son, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Uh, Baz is on a flight, talked to his manager. He said that he would have Baz call as soon as he landed.",
        "John: Anyone else?",
        "Blair: Well, uh, there was a friend. Uh, Calmar. Um, Claude Calmar. He's French. He's a friend of his, and I tried to call him a couple of times. His voicemail isn't even working.",
        "John: You mind if I look at Tom\u00e1s' room? There might be something there.",

        "Mrs. Evans: Obviously, if you won't marry him.",
        "Vivian: We are 100% committed to each other.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Then why not take the ring and make it official?",
        "Shaun: That was my question.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Marriage is very important to him. If you're committed, then why not go for it?",
        "Vivian: We will talk about this later.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Now, don't be mad at him. I'm the one that brought it up. Be mad at me.",
        "Vivian: This is a difficult discussion for me, okay? My parents had a horrible marriage. They had no business being together. They felt trapped, and they made sure that everyone knew how miserable they really were, okay? It was toxic. I don't want that life.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Then don't create it.",

He wanted to be with his family. He wanted to be with me. I don't care what kind of lead he had on Victor's murder. He wouldn't just run off or take off like you said without calling me first.
