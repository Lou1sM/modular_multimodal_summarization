        "Blair is doing better and dressed to go to the courthouse. Todd can see that she is doing well. She likes that he checked on her while she was sleeping but is sad when he tells that he wanted to make sure that she was ready to testify against Truman that morning. After she and Todd leave the penthouse, Starr comes downstairs and grabs her knapsack. Natalie hugs Michael and Marcie outside John's room. She is thrilled that John is alive and she can't wait to see him again. Michael wants her to be patient now that they know the truth and John is fine. \"Natalie, have you thought about the possibility that John might not be the same person when he comes out of this?\" She thinks that he means physically, but he means emotionally. Michael has had patients like this and either one of two things happens. The patient either becomes bitter over their situation or they get stronger from it and are determined to live a great life. Natalie thinks about this and has to admit that anyone who has been through what John has been through might be a little different. Blair is on the stand and she is questioned about her relationship with Spencer. \"How many times a week did you make love to the man?\" Evangeline objects but the judge allows the question. Blair says that she would have relations with the man about 2 to 3 times a week. Next the defense attorney asks if she was in fact, in love with Spencer Bo is in the office when Paige arrives with breakfast. She is so happy. She will be seeing Hugh's beautiful face that day and she can't wait. Bo sits her down and tells her that there is news. He says that John was misidentified and that he is alive. She is so happy to hear that. She sees in his eyes that there is more. There is, but he doesn't have to explain cause she can see it in his eyes. She starts crying now. She sobs and shouts, \"No! No!\" as Bo holds her tightly. Blair says that she only told Spencer that she loved him because she needed to find evidence that he was a killer. She says that she loved Todd and has always loved Todd. Mark asks her if she is lying now, or if she was lying to Spencer way back then. Blair says she knew he was a killer when he tried to kill her. Spencer shouts that she is a liar but Evangeline has the smoking gun it is the newspaper with the picture of Spencer getting arrested at his apartment. Todd and Blair are outside the courtroom. Todd understands that Blair had to say some things that he didn't like while on the stand. When Spencer is being brought out. He lunges for Blair shouting that she betrayed him. The guards get the crazy bastard under control and drag him off."

        "Blair: Well, Starr is up in her room, and I'll tell you why. She is not too happy that you have posted guards outside the penthouse.",
        "Todd: Tough. There's no way I'm going to risk having Cole Thornhart show up here again --",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Todd: To try to convince Starr not to press charges against him. Or worse.",
        "Blair: You don't have to persuade me on that one, but she's got to go back to school eventually, Todd.",
        "Todd: How are you feeling?",
        "Blair: Better. No headache.",
        "Todd: Good. Yeah, I checked in on you last night. It looked like you were sleeping peacefully.",
        "Blair: You checked on me last night?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. I hope you're going to be well enough to testify today.",
        "Blair: I think I will be.",
        "Todd: Good. Because I want Spencer to get everything that's coming to him. Ready?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Oh, that better be you, Cristian. Because I could fall madly in love with a man with hands like that.",
        "Cristian: You look so sexy in that suit.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah? Well, it's too bad you're not on the jury.",
        "Cristian: You're going to win this case. And you know why?",
        "Evangeline: Why?",
        "Cristian: Because you are brilliant at what you do.",
        "Evangeline: I have to win. John spent most of his life trying to put his father's killer behind bars. And I have to finish what he started before he died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey. Hi. John is still not awake.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, he's been pretty heavily sedated, so he's probably going to be out for a while.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Marcie, hey.",
        "Marcie: Hey. You know, when Michael told me that John was alive -- and all this time, I've been visiting, thinking that it was Hugh, I --",
        "Natalie: I know. I'm really sorry. I know that you were good friends with Hugh.",
        "Marcie: Oh, I -- I stopped by church this morning, I said a prayer.",
        "Natalie: Hugh was a great guy.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, he was. But you know what? We are so blessed that John is alive, and I know -- you know, I know that Hugh would want us to focus on that, so --",
        "Natalie: I'm just so excited. John's going to be home soon. You know what? I'm going to go talk to his surgeon and see when that's going to be.",
        "Michael: Yeah, you know, it might not be for a while, you know? I mean, he's in pretty bad shape, and he's definitely going to need more surgery, so --",
        "Natalie: You're right. I'm just a little overanxious here, obviously. I just -- you know, the thought of John coming home, when I thought he'd never come home again. I just can't wait to get him home! But I guess what we have to focus on is that he is alive, and -- and that's all that matters.",
        "Michael: Natalie, have you thought about the fact that -- when Johnny comes to, he may not be the same person that he was before the accident?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So, it should be a fairly simple transaction. I set up the account several years ago with some money my daughter inherited. I mean, some money that I inherited.",
        "Banker: I am aware of that, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Well, then, what's the holdup? I always intended for my daughter to have that money. It really should be very simple.",
        "Banker: Dr. Lord --",
        "Dorian: Do it, please. [Dorian giggles] There, isn't that the account on the screen?",
        "Banker: Yes, it is. But what I've been trying to say is the way you set up this account, there's no way your daughter can see a penny of this money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, you have no idea how happy I am to see another human being besides my mom or my dad or my brother.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: If it wasn't for you, I swear, I'd go crazy.",
        "Langston: I'm bombing math. That's the second time I've cut out of class this week.",
        "Starr: Well, I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: Don't be. I was worried about you. Starr, what's going on?",
        "Starr: My dad's threatening to transfer me out of llanview high.",
        "Langston: No! Why? That's so unfair. What did you do?",
        "Starr: I know. My dad treats me like a kid. Like what I say doesn't matter. Like he needs to protect me.",
        "Langston: You'll do fine. Just stay away from jerks like Cole.",
        "Starr: My mom seems to be listening to me. Maybe she'll persuade my dad or change his mind. I hope I see you in class soon.",
        "Langston: Me, too.",
        "Starr: Was everybody talking about it today? The party?",
        "Langston: It was definitely headline news. Cole going crazy, getting arrested. He wasn't even in school today. He may be suspended. Expelled, even.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bailiff: Court is now in session. All rise.",
        "Judge: Please be seated. Blair cramer, you may retake the stand.",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Judge: I remind you, Ms. Cramer, you are still under oath.",
        "Blair: Yes, sir.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you so much for coming back today, Ms. Cramer. I hope you're feeling better. When you were here testifying yesterday, before you fainted, you were telling us about having met the defendant at the hospital. Can you just refresh our memories, and tell us again why you were there?",
        "Blair: Yes. I was at the hospital because my son had a medical issue. And I was very frightened at the time. But it turned out to be nothing. And my son was being cared for by Dr. Truman.",
        "Evangeline: And after this professional meeting, the defendant began to pursue you romantically, is that correct?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Evangeline: And this romance --",
        "Blair: Ended. Done.",
        "Evangeline: Why?",
        "Blair: Because I realized he was a murderer.",
        "Mark: Objection, your honor. Please.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I have the D.N.A. Analysis right here, so -- thanks for putting a rush on it. I'll talk to you. [Knock on door] Yeah?",
        "Paige: Good time?",
        "Bo: Oh, sure. Yeah. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Paige: Apple turnovers.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Paige: Oh, my gosh. My picture! Huh!",
        "Bo: I missed it. So I put it back.",
        "Paige: That makes me extremely happy. I thought we could have breakfast together before you head to the courthouse and I go over to the hospital to see Hugh. Got apple turnovers and coffee. Good coffee. I -- I had the best sleep I've had in a long time, because the skin grafts are done and today I'm going to see his beautiful face again.",
        "Bo: Um -- honey, sit down, ok? Please.",
        "Paige: Ok.",
        "Bo: There's something that I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What do you mean, John's not going to be the same, Michael? Is he going to be all right or not?",
        "Michael: Listen, he may come out of this totally fine. I mean, in recent years, there have been unbelievable advances in skin graft technology. Even so, his face and his body have been severely burned. So in layman's terms, he may n look -- well, he may not look exactly normal.",
        "Natalie: You're not telling me anything I don't know.",
        "Michael: Yes, I know. I'm sure you've done your research.",
        "Natalie: Ok, so why are you going on and on about this?",
        "Michael: Look, I -- I think basically what I'm trying to tell you here is that John is going to need a considerable amount of care. Not just from his doctors, not just from his friends and family, but from his loved ones.",
        "Natalie: I know this, Michael.",
        "Michael: Natalie, please. For once, would you just listen to me?",
        "Natalie: Ok, you know what? I'm -- I'm not trying to be unkind, Michael. But if you think that I actually give a damn about what John looks like or how much help he is going to need, I am going to be by his side every waking minute. And I'm going to take care of him as long as it takes.",
        "Michael: That's if he'll let you.",
        "Natalie: If he'll -- you think that John won't want me to help him? You think he's going to push me away?",
        "Michael: We're talking about my brother. It's a definite possibility.",
        "Natalie: I won't let him.",
        "Michael: I know you won't. Look, I've been around a lot of patients who have gone through catastrophic experiences. Now, some people become very embittered and resentful. But others look at it as a second chance for life, a chance to do things differently, better, a chance to make every moment count as if it was their last.",
        "Natalie: Well, I -- I guess when you have gone through an experience like what John's gone through, something's bound to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: This is outrageous. This money is my daughter's inheritance. That is -- it is money that I always intended for her to have.",
        "Banker: The account is an irrevocable trust, Dr. Lord, with asset protection for 10 years.",
        "Dorian: 10 years? Why, that means I wouldn't be able to touch the money until --",
        "Banker: 2014. You set it up this way, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Huh. What was I thinking? Oh, that's right. I remember what I was thinking. I -- I wanted to be certain that my then-fiancee, David Vickers, was marrying me for love. I wanted David to be denied access to the money, not me.",
        "Banker: I'm sorry.",
        "Dorian: \"Sorry\" does not begin to cut it. I always intended for my daughter to have that money. It's just at the time, I felt that she was too young and too reckless to be able to manage such a large amount. I was being protective -- that's why I took control of my daughter's money.",
        "Adriana: You did what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Yo, Rex.",
        "Rex: Roxy -- whoa.",
        "Roxy: You want to finish that sentence? \"Whoa, Roxy, you look like a million bucks,\" or \"whoa, Roxy, you look like hell\"?",
        "Rex: No. You look great, fine. What are you doing out so early?",
        "Roxy: What are you doing out so late? Speaking of hell -- What's going on with you?",
        "Rex: Oh, I have a dilemma.",
        "Roxy: Hey, I'm not going to have to give you one of my kidneys, am I?",
        "Rex: There's nothing physically wrong with me. I've just been playing \"what would you do if,\" that's all.",
        "Roxy: I like that game, and two can play that little game. All right. So, hit me with a big \"what if.\"",
        "Rex: Ok. Well, there's this little boy who has these good people who love him very much, but they're not his biological parents.",
        "Roxy: Got it. The adoptive parents who love him very much, and they love him with all of their heart.",
        "Rex: But at the same time, the kid has a living biological parent who wants him back.",
        "Roxy: For all the wrong reasons, I betcha.",
        "Rex: Well, yeah, actually. This parent would not be as good an influence on the kid as the others.",
        "Roxy: Definitely not.",
        "Rex: \"Definitely not\" -- you don't even know what I'm talking about.",
        "Roxy: Guess again, toots. Not only do I know what the hell you're talking about, but I know exactly what you need to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm sure Cole's mom'll fight for him.",
        "Langston: It's not up to her. The school board has to have a meeting about it. It's really big deal.",
        "Starr: Like I didn't know that.",
        "Langston: You said you wanted to know what was going on, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, but I could deal without the play-by-play.",
        "Langston: Ok, I'll stick to the facts. There's an assembly for the whole school this afternoon to talk about parties and steroids and all the other things that kids do to screw up our lives -- should be hilarious. I'm sorry. Ok, just the facts. I forgot. Here's one -- Cole got kicked off the football team.",
        "Starr: What? No, football is his life!",
        "Langston: Well, he shouldn't have blown it by doing drugs!",
        "Starr: He didn't mean to, Langston! A lot of athletes take steroids and they don't know what it'll cost.",
        "Langston: Wait, wait -- are you defending him? You sound like a newspaper article.",
        "Starr: I've been reading up.",
        "Langston: Just look under l for \"loser.\"",
        "Starr: He didn't mean to hurt me. 'Roid rage -- it's a real thing.",
        "Langston: Starr --",
        "Starr: He didn't --",
        "Langston: You're not thinking of forgiving him, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mark: Your honor, please. This is conjecture on Ms. Cramer's part.",
        "Judge: Sustained. The jury will disregard the witness' last statement. Please continue, Ms. Williamson.",
        "Evangeline: Of course, your honor. Ms. Cramer, did the defendant ever say anything to you that led you to believe he had something to do with Thomas Mc Bain's death?",
        "Blair: Yes, he did.",
        "Evangeline: Please explain.",
        "Blair: When Spencer's brother, David, was arrested for the murder, Spencer admitted to me that he always took advantage of his little brother, all of his life.",
        "Evangeline: I see. And, Ms. Cramer, how did you become involved in the police investigation of the defendant?",
        "Blair: During the course of my relationship with Dr. Truman, I found a photo of Spencer and his father, in which Spencer was holding the gun that was used to shoot Thomas Mc Bain.",
        "Evangeline: The witness is referring to the photograph already entered into evidence, exhibit K. You remember this photograph, right, ladies and gentlemen?",
        "Blair: And when I found the photo, I handed it right over to the police.",
        "Evangeline: Did this photograph of the defendant with the murder weapon help lead the police to the murder weapon?",
        "Blair: Yes, it did.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you very much, Ms. Cramer. No further questions at this time.",
        "Spencer: Go easy on her. She still may t be well.",
        "Mark: My job is to save your life. Let me do what I need to do. Ahem. Good morning, Ms. Cramer. Glad to see you're feeling better today. Ms. Cramer, can you please tell the jury, how many times did you and Dr. Truman make love?",
        "Evangeline: Objection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Adriana, I was just explaining to this --",
        "Adriana: I've heard enough.",
        "Dorian: No, you couldn't possibly --",
        "Adriana: No, I get it. My money -- the money I was going to use to start my company, to realize my dream -- is gone.",
        "Dorian: No, it is not gone. I put it into trust to protect it for you. In fact, I came here today expressly to have the money moved into your account.",
        "Adriana: Oh -- right when I told you I was going to withdraw it. What a coincidence.",
        "Banker: Ladies, if I may interject --",
        "Dorian: No, you may not.",
        "Adriana: Let him speak.",
        "Banker: Oh, what I was going to say is --",
        "Dorian: I don't want you to say anything. What I want you to do is to please leave us alone. My daughter and I need to talk privately.",
        "Adriana: No, stay. Tell me exactly what is going on with my money.",
        "Banker: All I know is it's in an account for Dr. Lord. And I do think I should leave you ladies alone to discuss this. It is a family matter, after all.",
        "Dorian: Oh. All right. I am going to write you a check for the entire amount that is in this trust account, and, you know, give it to you. No harm done.",
        "Adriana: \"No harm\"? You want to write a check to ease your guilt over ripping off your own daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Bo, what is it? You're -- you're scaring me.",
        "Bo: There's been a terrible mistake.",
        "Paige: A \"mistake\"?",
        "Bo: The man that you've been visiting in the hospital -- it's -- it's not your son. It's not Hugh.",
        "Paige: I -- I don't understand.",
        "Bo: It's John Mc Bain.",
        "Paige: What?",
        "Bo: John was misidentified.",
        "Paige: So -- you mean, John's alive? Well, that -- that's -- that's wonderful. That's -- oh, my God. What? Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no! No! Oh. Oh, no! Oh, no! No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, my mother had to forgive my father for doing something awful or else they would've never gotten together.",
        "Langston: I know.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I know you know. So does everybody at Llanview high, thanks to Britney and her stupid slide show. Oh, my God. Does everyone know the details now? That the person who my dad did that to is Cole's mom?",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry.",
        "Starr: I can't believe this. Do you know how much this sucks? Do you have any idea?",
        "Langston: Starr, I -- I don't care about your dad or Cole's mother or anything else that happened, like, a gazillion years ago. I care about you and about what happened the other night. You are so lucky that you just got away with a ripped shirt. Cole could've really hurt you.",
        "Starr: Someone's I.M.'ing me.",
        "Starr: It's Cole. \"Thinking of you. U should know I'm the guy from Halloween, not the jerk from the party.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: This is ridiculous, your honor, and how in the world is it relevant?",
        "Mark: Your honor, I'm simply trying to establish for the jury the relationship between Ms. Cramer and the defendant, which I believe is relevant to the witness' testimony.",
        "Evangeline: How does knowing how many times people have had sex help to establish their relationship? Surely the jury understands that even in a failed relationship, and most specifically in abusive relationships, the sexual activity is often high.",
        "Judge: Objection overruled. You may continue, Mr. Casey.",
        "Mark: Thank you, your honor. I'll repeat the question, Ms. Cramer. How many times did you and Dr. Truman make love?",
        "Blair: I didn't keep count, Mr. Casey.",
        "Mark: Well, approximately, then. Would you say it's a hundred times? 200 times? I mean, after all, you're an attractive young couple, you've been together for a couple of months. Is it safe to assume that you made love two times a week? Three times a week? Answer the question, Ms. Cramer.",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Mark: \"Yes\" what?",
        "Blair: Two, three -- don't know.",
        "Mark: So it's safe to assume that you made love many times?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Mark: Ms. Cramer, at any point in your relationship, were you in love with Dr. Truman?",

        "Dorian: Adriana, this isn't the way it seems.",
        "Adriana: It never is with you.",
        "Dorian: I -- I put the money aside for you. I put it in trust. That -- that's the only reason why it can't be touched for a few years.",
        "Adriana: So you put my money in a trust without my knowledge or permission?",
        "Dorian: I was keeping it safe for you.",
        "Adriana: You stole my money.",
        "Dorian: I did not! I put it into a trust. I -- I was doing it for your welfare.",
        "Adriana: Oh, of course -- the multipurpose excuse for every mean and destructive thing you do. \"It was just for your welfare -- that's why I tried to destroy your relationship, that's why I hired that nut job to stalk you.\"",
        "Dorian: I will make it up to you. Adriana, I swear I will. I -- I will write you a check --",

        "Adriana: No, you will not, ok?",
        "Dorian: And put it into your --",
        "Adriana: I don't want your money, it's tainted. Everything you touch is repulsive.",
        "Dorian: Adriana --",
        "Adriana: I don't want anything from you.",
        "Dorian: Well, then, how will you get the money to start your business?",
        "Adriana: I'll figure it out, I'm resourceful.",
        "Dorian: Like mother, like daughter?",
        "Adriana: Please don't say that again or I think I might puke. I am nothing like you, Dorian. I am not pet or spiteful, vengeful or sneaky. And I would never hurt the people I should love the most. I would rather die first.",
        "Dorian: Like mother, like daughter.",

        "Rex: But I wasn't -- ok. Let me ask you. Did you ever question your decision -- to let somebody else raise your son?",
        "Roxy: Who decided? You were taken away from me.",
        "Rex: Right -- dumb question. You had no say in it.",
        "Roxy: I wanted to keep you so bad, my little sack of sugar. That's what I used to call you, \"my little sack of sugar.\" I just wanted to hold you in my arms till the end of time. But that wasn't what I was best at -- being a mother -- as Natalie can tell you.",
        "Rex: So, do you think letting aunt Corinne raise me was the right thing to do?",
        "Roxy: Well, she could give you things that I couldn't -- like a clean house, like three squares a day, like a family who celebrated all the holidays together. But there wasn't one day that I didn't think about you. And there wasn't one day that I didn't get up in the morning, staring at your baby picture from the first thing in the morning -- till I hit the bottle, till I hit the sack at night. So, giving you to Corinne -- I think that was the best thing for everybody.",
        "Rex: Look, I know what the best thing for everyone is -- [Rex sighs] But is it the right thing?",
        "Roxy: Since when does that matter to you so much?",

        "Natalie: I'll be here.",
        "Michael: Hey, listen, um, I really think that this is something that we should keep between us -- at least until Hugh's family has been notified.",
        "Natalie: Makes sense.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Ok.",
        "Marcie: Should we go?",
        "Michael: This is a miracle, Johnny. This -- this is a miracle.",
        "Natalie: I won't let you push me away, John.",

        "Mark: I'll repeat the question. Were you in love with Dr. Truman?",
        "Blair: No, I was not.",
        "Mark: And yet you were engaged to be married to him, weren't you?",
        "Blair: I never intended to marry Dr. Truman. I accepted his proposal because I needed to search for evidence against him.",
        "Mark: But you did tell him that you loved him, didn't you?",
        "Blair: Yes, I did.",
        "Mark: So you're a liar?",
        "Evangeline: Objection. The witness is not on trial here.",
        "Mark: I'm simply trying to establish the credibility of the witness.",
        "Judge: Overruled. Proceed, Mr. Casey.",
        "Blair: I'm not a liar. Spencer took advantage of my vulnerability -- when the man that I really loved was taken away from me because Spencer set Todd up.",
        "Mark: Your vulnerability notwithstanding, Ms. Cramer, did you or did you not have feelings for Spencer Truman?",
        "Blair: Yes, I had feelings --",
        "Evangeline: Objection! The witness has already answered that question.",
        "Blair: Because Spencer took every opportunity to make me hate Todd. So, yeah, I thought that I loved him. But I was -- I was confused and hurt. And Spencer -- he was messing with my head --",
        "Evangeline: Objection, your honor.",
        "Blair: And I should've listened to my heart. Because I still love Todd. I will always love Todd. I love you, Todd.",
        "Evangeline: Objection. May I approach, your honor?",
        "Judge: That won't be necessary, Ms. Williamson. Ms. Cramer, you will answer only the questions that are posed to you. Do you understand?",
        "Blair: I was asked to tell the whole truth, and everything I said just now is true.",
        "Mark: The same way everything you said on the stand was true when you accused another former fiancee, Todd Manning, of rape?",
        "Evangeline: Objection!",

        "Langston: \"Ever again.\"",
        "Starr: Langston, no -- you sent it? Why would you do that?",
        "Langston: Because it's the right thing to do, Starr. Look, I know it's really crappy when you really like a guy and he turns out to be a dumb-jock, steroid- using perv. But it's better you find out who he was now before you started to really like him.",
        "Starr: But that's just it, Langston -- I don't know exactly who he is.",
        "Langston: No? Then I suggest you dig up that ripped shirt from the trash. That should enlighten you. Listen, I got to go. I can only get away with saying \"I was throwing up\" for one class. I'll text you in French. See you in school?",
        "Starr: Uh -- yeah. Thank you for coming.",

        "Rex: Oh, I'm sorry. Roxy, I was not trying to make you upset. I totally get why you gave me up. It was out of love.",
        "Roxy: Damn straight it was.",
        "Rex: My only regret is that I didn't get to spend a lot of my childhood with you -- or Natalie. Because you're both cool people.",
        "Roxy: So we're spending a lot of time together now. Aren't you happy about that?",
        "Rex: You know I am.",
        "Roxy: And here's a really cool thing -- you grew up and you're great, so I can't screw you up anymore.",
        "Rex: You're right. People can find each other later in life, and there's nothing that can be done about what happened.",
        "Roxy: Oh, God, I love you so much it hurts.",
        "Rex: I love you, too, rox.",
        "Roxy: Is this game over? Because I got to go to bed.",
        "Rex: Game's over.",

        "Paige: Oh, no. No, that's -- that's -- it's too impersonal. I -- I'm going to call them.",

        "Evangeline: Objection, your honor. The state is not yet trying the defendant for alleged crimes against Todd Manning, and, therefore, bringing them up is misleading.",
        "Judge: Objection sustained. I will allow the comment to be recorded. However, I will warn you, Mr. Casey, to restrict your questions and your comments to the details of this case.",
        "Mark: No further questions, your honor.",
        "Judge: Redirect, Ms. Williamson?",
        "Evangeline: Thank you, your honor. Ms. Cramer, one further question. Did you, at any time, have reason to believe that the defendant was capable of murder?",

        "Blair: Yes, I can. It was the morning after the night Spencer Truman tried to strangle me.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you, Ms. Cramer. You may step down. Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution rests.",

        "Dorian: Yippee.",
        "Banker: That doesn't please you?",
        "Dorian: I know that you're a banker, but even you have to concede that there are more important things than money.",
        "Banker: Yes, that's true, but it certainly does help. Excuse me.",
