    "Recap": [
        "Rex knows he needs to tell many people that Mitch Laurence is his father. First he tells Shane who is worried to know that his grandfather is an evil man. Then he informs Jessica for the first time that Mitch is his father and he is her half brother. Then he goes to warn Stacy, assuming that she is still pregnant with his child (and not that it's probably Schuyler's), that his father and \"their baby's\" grandfather could endanger her or the baby. At that point, she knows she better never let Rex find out that the baby is not his. At the same time, Schuyler is ready to tell Gigi that he knows that Stacy is not pregnant with Rex's child and it might very well be his (Schuyler's) child. But he is afraid that it will make her hate him, for Rex to know he has no more ties with Stacy and for Rex and Gigi to get back together. And he realizes he better not tell her. Matthew expresses his gratitude to Dani for helping him to get the surgery so that he can walk when his own parents wanted to prevent it. So he's ready to help her escape from her own parents even though Destiny does not want him to see Dani ever again. Tea, Todd and Ross are all in jail and wondering what they will do now that it's been discovered that Todd is the father of Tea's daughter, whom he's never before knew existed."

        "David: Wow, that's quite nice. Thank you, Nevil.",
        "Nevil: 37 degrees.",
        "David: 37 degrees? I'm dead!",
        "Nevil: 37 degrees Celsius, sir. You're very much alive and past the worst of this flu.",
        "David: Then why do I still feel so lousy?",
        "Nevil: Well, if I were to venture a guess, I'd say it had something to do with the news piece you keep staring at on the computer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I found this on the doorstep when I came back from my run.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. \"To my...\"",
        "Brody: What is it?",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. It's from Mitch Laurence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: This is my grandfather? His blood saved my life?",
        "Gigi: His blood, not him.",
        "Rex: Giving you that blood was the only decent thing he ever did, and he was unconscious when he did it.",
        "Shane: He can't be worse than Aunt Stacy.",
        "Rex: Trust me. Mitch Laurence makes your Aunt Stacy look like a saint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Oh...coffee. Thank God.",
        "Kim: You can't have coffee.",
        "Stacy: Oh, just one cup. Give me a break! I had a dream that Rex figured out he wasn't the father. It was so real. He looked like he hated me.",
        "Kim: Would you stop worrying? Schuyler's the only one who knows Rex isn't the baby-daddy. And as long as he thinks the baby is his, he'll keep his mouth shut.",
        "Stacy: Yeah. What if Schuyler remembers that we didn't actually sleep together?",
        "Kim: If that was gonna happen, it would have happened by now.",
        "Stacy: Are you sure?",
        "Kim: Yes. Look, Schuyler is desperate to keep us quiet about Gigi spending the night in his room. He'll keep his mouth shut.",
        "Stacy: You know, you're good at this.",
        "Kim: I know. Will you help me pick out an outfit for today?",
        "Stacy: What's today?",
        "Kim: Job interview. Clint Buchanan is gonna hire me as his next executive assistant.",
        "Stacy: Executive assistant. God, that sounds boring.",
        "Kim: Yeah, I won't be there long, honey. I intend to fast-track it to the bedroom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Coughing and sniffling]",
        "Kevin: I am so sorry that none of us could make it home for Jared's funeral. If this flu wasn't kicking our butts, we would be there.",
        "Clint: I'll make sure your sister understands that, your mother and Charlie, too. Is Zane all right?",
        "Kevin: He's the only one who hasn't gotten it yet. The rest of us are all pretty much on lockdown.",
        "Clint: So, none of you are able to travel?",
        "Kevin: Well, one of us, maybe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You know, a part of me is glad that Viki won that election.",
        "Nevil: I'll undoubtedly regret asking this. Which part, sir?",
        "David: The part of me that says, \"Finally, Dorian can give up this silly crusade towards human rights and equality and focus on what's truly important.\"",
        "Nevil: Which would be what, sir?",
        "David: Me!",
        "Nevil: Oh, yeah, of course. Mm-hmm. [Indistinct].",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: So, how is Natalie doing?",
        "Clint: Well, I'm not sure. I mean, how does anybody cope with losing the love of their life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, I need to make a call.",
        "Guard: You get one phone call, and you had yours already.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know, but my daughter was placed in child services last night. I just need to talk to her, okay?",
        "Guard: Sorry, lady. Rules are rules.",
        "T\u00e9a: I need to talk to my daughter!",
        "Ross: You mean our daughter.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ross, how many times do I have to tell you? You are not Daniella's biological father. I have a DNA test to prove it. Okay? And when I get out of here, Daniella's gonna be made to understand that you're not her biological father. Todd is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Watch this.",
        "Destiny: That's awesome!",
        "Matthew: No, you know what's even more awesome? Your parents staying an extra day in Seattle so we can hang out. It's great to have a friend around.",
        "Destiny: What about that girl from boarding school?",
        "Matthew: Who, Dani?",
        "Destiny: You two had a deal, right? She helped you get here to have your surgery, and you help her get home to find her dad.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but I'm afraid I'll never be able to pay her back. She's gone.",
        "Destiny: Really? That's too bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: You know, I'm glad Dani's with Child Services. That way, you can't kidnap her again.",
        "T\u00e9a: Putting your own child in boarding school is not kidnapping.",
        "Ross: Ha! It is when you steal her from the other parent. You know... you'd know something about that, wouldn't you, Manning? I think you two deserve each other. But if you think that you guys are gonna run off together and raise Dani together, think again. Danielle's got one father. That would be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: That man is not my father.",
        "Brody: Jess, it's okay. It's only a letter.",
        "Jessica: I felt so much better when I thought I'd killed him. I wish I had.",
        "Brody: The Napa P.D. have Laurence under 24-hour guard. He should not have been able to get this letter to you. I'm gonna make sure he never does again.",
        "Jessica: Brody's right. It's just a letter. It can't hurt me if I don't read it.",
        "Brody: Yeah, this is Officer Lovett with Llanview P.D. I'd like to speak to your commissioner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: What did my grandfather do?",
        "Rex: Shane...Mitch Laurence isn't just a bad person. He's sick in the head. Your grandfather, my father, is the kind of man who enjoys hurting other people.",
        "Gigi: He's hurt several people we love.",
        "Rex: I never want him to get close enough to hurt you.",
        "Shane: But what if I get sick again and we need more of his stem cells?",
        "Gigi: We've still got that extra supply at the hospital. We'll never need to see him or even talk to him.",
        "Shane: Where is he now?",
        "Rex: Jail. Locked up where he can't hurt anybody. But if you ever get a call from him or a letter from him, you tell me immediately, you understand?",
        "Shane: I'm really sorry.",
        "Rex: For what?",
        "Shane: You deserve to have a great dad, like I do.",
        "Rex: I ended up with you and your mom. Can't get luckier than that. I should get going, spread the bad news.",
        "Gigi: You're going to see Jessica?",
        "Rex: Right after I talk to Stacy.",
        "Gigi: Stacy? Why?",
        "Rex: The baby she's having is Mitch Laurence's grandchild. I have to protect them, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You live in a cave?",
        "Kim: The funeral starts 1/2 hour later than I thought. That gives me some wiggle time.",
        "Stacy: For what? To find a worst possible moment to ask Clint Buchanan for a job? 'Cause I think that's it.",
        "Kim: You're wrong. There's never been a better moment.",
        "Stacy: You have a plan, don't you?",
        "Kim: Don't I always?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Well, at least you have Nora there to help you get through this.",
        "Clint: Nora's gone back to Seattle with Bo because, well, I thought they should be with Matthew on Thanksgiving.",
        "Kevin: Oh, so, Matthew's talking to them again?",
        "Clint: Matthew's surgery was a success, thank the good Lord. At least something good has happened lately. Anyway, Bo and Nora should be back in time for the funeral.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nevil: I gather you care a great deal for this Dr. Lord.",
        "David: Nevil, I have come to the conclusion that Dorian and I are soul mates. Do you know \"soul mates\"?",
        "Nevil: Romeo and Juliet.",
        "David: Brad and Angelina.",
        "Nevil: Troilus and Cressida.",
        "David: Ellen and Portia.",
        "Nevil: Edward and Mrs. Simpson.",
        "David: Bo and Nora.",
        "Nevil: Ah... did you just say what I thought you said? Ow!",
        "David: Nevil, the relationship between master and manservant is like that of shrink and his patient. Isn't that right?",
        "Nevil: How do you mean, sir?",
        "David: Absolute confidentiality. Look, I promised my pa that I wouldn't tell anyone that Bo and Nora kissed the night before she married Uncle Clint.",
        "Nevil: You may rely on my confidence, sir.",
        "David: By \"confidence,\" what do you mean?",
        "Nevil: I won't tell anybody.",
        "David: Excellent! Well played, Nevil. Uncle Clint cannot catch wind of this. It would be absolutely tragic.",
        "Nevil: Sir...",
        "David: Like Shakespeare, only sadder. Two people who love each other as much as Bo and Nora having to sneak around while--",
        "Nevil: Mr. Vickers, sir.",
        "David: Buchanan, Nevil! Buchanan! Cousin Kevin. Howdy.",
        "Kevin: Nevil, would you mind leaving us alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: How do I look?",
        "Stacy: Like a million bucks.",
        "Kim: Chump change for my future husband Clint. Poor man. He's just obsessed with keeping me in style. It looks like we're both finally gonna get what we want.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, as long as Schuyler doesn't go all Boy Scout and blab that Rex isn't the baby's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Honey... [Ahem] Are you sure you're okay with what your dad told you?",
        "Shane: I don't even know that guy.",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "Gigi: You weren't out hiding in the bushes again, waiting for Rex to leave, were you?",
        "Schuyler: Ha! No. No. Actually, Rex is the person I came to see. I have something to tell him.",
        "Gigi: Really? Well, Rex had to go see Stacy. So, whatever it is, maybe you can tell me instead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: For the last time, Schuyler wants Gigi way more than a clear conscience. He's not gonna risk what they have, especially not when he's so close to getting what he wants.",
        "Stacy: I hope you're right.",
        "Kim: Trust me. No one's ever gonna know Rex isn't the father and that you're not as far along as you're supposed to be.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rex: Stacy, it's Rex. Decent?",
        "Stacy: Just hold on a second. I gotta put on my robe. One second.",
        "Kim: Hi. Bye.",
        "Rex: Wow. You're really starting to show.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, woke up this morning, and I couldn't see my feet. So what are you doing here? What did I do now?",
        "Rex: Nothing. We need to talk... about the man whose blood is running through that baby's veins.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: That girl is T\u00e9a Delgado's daughter?",
        "Matthew: I know. Can you believe it? And T\u00e9a hates Dani's dad, which is why she's trying to keep them apart.",
        "Destiny: Whoa. What did he do?",
        "Matthew: I don't know. T\u00e9a says he's got some monster temper, so T\u00e9a's taking her away to Puerto Rico.",
        "Destiny: She give you an address or phone number?",
        "Matthew: Nope. Nothing.",
        "Destiny: I'm sorry.",
        "Matthew: But you know, she loves waves, so I know she's catching some gnarly ones out there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: That daughter of ours is probably the only person that can outsmart you, T\u00e9a. You tried to lock her up in that boarding school, but you couldn't keep her there, could you, because she had to get out to find the only father she's ever known. That would be me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ross. Please try to unders--",
        "Ross: You think she's gonna buy that bogus line about Manning being her father? I'm betting no.",
        "T\u00e9a: The proof is right there in Todd's hands. Look at it again.",
        "[Door rattles]",
        "Ross: Oh! Thank God. Where have you been? Get me out of here.",
        "Elijah: Well, I'm not here for you, Ross. I'm here for T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I want you to tell me everything you know about Bo and Nora.",
        "David: Bo and Nora? Oh! Now I get it. You think I was talking about Bo and Nora Buchanan. No, no, no! The Bo and Nora I was referring to are characters in a play. I was running lines.",
        "Kevin: Okay, cut the crap. Not that good an actor. Is what you told Nevil true? Did you really see Bo and Nora kissing the night before she married my dad? Answer me, damn it!",
        "David: I'm sorry. I stopped listening after \"not a very good actor.\"",
        "Kevin: Oh, for...",
        "David: What?",
        "Kevin: Answer me!",
        "David: Look, I don't know! Matthew saw it, not me. I caught him on tape saying it. That's all.",
        "Kevin: Listen, I'm gonna need that footage.",
        "David: I'm sorry. That's not a possibility. That footage is the intellectual property of David Vickers-Buchanan productions, a limited liability partner-- would you just let me go?",
        "Kevin: All right. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Are Bo and Nora having an affair?",
        "David: Define affair.",
        "Kevin: You've said they love each other.",
        "David: Oh, come on. That's just something that people say, like \"I promise to pay you back\" or \"hey, I just turned 39.\"",
        "Kevin: Did they say it, David?",
        "David: Once. They said it once that I'm aware of.",
        "Kevin: Man, I knew something was going on when they were here, but I just assumed it was because of Matthew. I never thought that... oh, damn it.",
        "David: Kevin. You're not gonna tell Clint about any of this, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Thank you, Nigel. Oh, could you find out if Bo and Nora are still grounded in Seattle?",
        "Nigel: Right away, sir.",
        "Clint: Thanks.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Nigel: May I help you?",
        "Kim: Yes, thank you. I'm here to see Mr. Clint Buchanan.",
        "Nigel: And what, may I ask, is the nature of your business?",
        "Kim: That's between me and Mr. Buchanan. Now, if you'll excuse me--",
        "Nigel: I'm sorry, Miss, but this house is in mourning.",
        "Clint: Nigel, what's going on?",
        "Kim: Mr. Buchanan. I'm so sorry to bother you like this. My name is Kimberly Andrews. And I'm just so sorry about what happened to your son-in-law. Jared was really a terrific guy.",
        "Clint: You knew Jared?",
        "Kim: Yes. Intimately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You recognize him? Last time you saw him was at the Boutet Clinic. He was in a coma while you and Roxy were stealing his blood.",
        "Stacy: Why is Roxy keeping Rex's father such a big secret? Wow.",
        "Rex: You probably didn't know who he was then, but around here the guy's practically a legend. He's a murderer, a rapist, a cult leader. If it's evil, dear old dad has done it.",
        "Stacy: Rex, I am so sorry. I know how much you wanted to find out who your real father was, but I mean if he's so horrible-- I hate to sound like a bitch, but maybe it's a good thing he's dead.",
        "Rex: Yeah, about that. Turns out Mitch is alive.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Rex: But don't worry. He is in a California jail. But people tell me that won't stop him from going after everything that he thinks is his. If he finds out that you and I are having a baby together, he might take an interest in you.",
        "Stacy: What kind of interest?",
        "Brody: I don't care what your log says! That letter to Jessica Brennan did not deliver itself. They're covering their own asses. Don't burn it. We can give it to John.",
        "Jessica: No. I'm gonna read it first.",
        "Brody: Why?",
        "Jessica: Because when I first saw it, I wanted to crawl into a hole and pretend this wasn't happening.",
        "Brody: Sounds reasonable to me.",
        "Jessica: No. No. That's what made me let Tess and Bess out to take care of things for me.",
        "Brody: You know he only wrote this to get in your head.",
        "Jessica: And I'm only his victim if I let that happen. Besides, you're right here, and he's behind bars.",
        "Brody: Okay. Let's do this.",
        "Jessica: \"Dear Jessica, I've had occasion to reflect on the conversation we had during your brief visit.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I can't wait for you to get back home and start walking again. Before you know it, everything will be back to normal.",
        "Matthew: It's funny. I don't even know what the word \"normal\" means anymore. Sometimes I still feel like nothing will ever be the same again.",
        "Destiny: What do you mean? You're still the same Matthew, at least to me.",
        "[Cart rattles loudly]",
        "Destiny: Uh, thanks, but we're trying to have a conversation here.",
        "Matthew: Dani?",
        "Dani: Matthew, you have to help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: I checked first thing this morning. Danielle's still at Child Services Center, and she's fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you.",
        "Ross: Excuse me. You're working for her? You're my brother.",
        "Elijah: So, I suppose when you knocked me out and stole my credit cards, that was your idea of brotherly love?",
        "Ross: I was looking for my daughter.",
        "Elijah: You said they both know about Danielle?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Todd's been staring at the test results all night, hasn't said a word. Ross refuses to accept it and won't shut up. It's been fun.",
        "Elijah: I see. You told Manning that Danielle's his daughter. He hasn't said anything about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. We've been here all night. He hasn't uttered a single word. I don't know what he's thinking and it scares me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: \"I'm afraid I acted out of hurt and anger, rather than compassion and love. But you were also not without blame. You disobeyed one of our commandments--to honor your father. But that's all right. With my guidance, you will learn contrition. I look forward to seeing you again and meeting... my beautiful little granddaughter. Is Victoria having Christmas this year? In the Lord's name, Dad.\" I hate it when he talks about Bree. I hate it.",
        "Brody: That was a threat. We're taking this to John. Maybe he can knock some sense into the Napa P.D.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Brody: I don't want to leave you alone. I'll see John at the service anyway.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no. The sooner John gets that, the better, okay? Anyway, my mom has beefed up security. I'll be fine.",
        "Brody: You sure?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I'm sure. Okay? I'll see you at the church.",
        "Brody: I promise you, Mitch will never hurt you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Don't let this stress you out.",
        "Stacy: Wait. You tell me your father's a maniac who might break out of jail and come get me, and you don't want me to stress out?",
        "Rex: Stacy, I'm not gonna let anybody hurt our baby, but we need to be prepared. Now, you have his picture. Memorize his face. Have... Kim memorize it, too, 'cause you never ever want to run into him in person.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Rex. Thank you for being so concerned about our baby...and me. Ah... and thank you for getting him so worried about me and our baby. Oh, he said it. \"Our baby.\" Ha ha! Oh! I'm starting to like you already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Ha! I'm just gonna come right out and say it. Rex is not the father of Stacy's baby.",
        "Gigi: You sure?",
        "Schuyler: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. It's really over. Thank you!",
        "Schuyler: No, no, no. No, there's more. Um... it's mine. The baby's mine.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Schuyler: I'm so sorry, Gigi. I'm so sorry.",
        "Gigi: So, this baby that my sister's been using to drive Rex and me apart is yours?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. I only just found out.",
        "Rex: What's he doing here?",
        "Gigi: He had something to tell me. Stacy's baby isn't yours. She's finally out of our lives. And so is he.",
        "Schuyler: What? No. No, we're friends.",
        "Gigi: You are not my friend. You knew what my bitch of a sister did to me. I was falling apart, and you let me cry on your shoulder, and the whole time you were sleeping with her.",
        "Schuyler: No! No, it's not like that at all.",
        "Gigi: Get out. Get out. I never want to see you again for the rest of my life.",
        "Gigi: So, here's the coffee. Um, tell me. What do you want to talk to Rex about?",

        "Elijah: And from what I understand, you tried to choke the life out of her. Oh, and Todd, I'll see what I can do for you, too.",
        "Ross: The hell with you, Eli. Give me a real lawyer, please.",
        "T\u00e9a: There's no way they're gonna let Ross anywhere near Daniella, right?",

        "Destiny: Aren't you supposed to be in Puerto Rico?",
        "Dani: Yeah, but my father showed up before my mom could even take me away, and all hell broke loose. So I called the cops and told them that my mom and her creepy boyfriend were trying to kidnap me, which I totally thought they had in mind. Anyway, all three of them got arrested, and I had to spend the night in Child Services, which is so not a 4-star hotel.",

        "Dani: No, I broke out.",
        "Matthew: How?",
        "Dani: Well, I busted out of Warwick with you in a wheelchair. This was nothing. Unfortunately, they're probably looking for me now. Matthew, I can't go back there, and I'm afraid my mom might take me away again. I need to stay here and think.",
        "Destiny: Well, you can't.",
        "Dani: Excuse me?",
        "Destiny: I mean, isn't this the first place they would look?",

        "Destiny: Matthew just got out of surgery. He can't be hiding a fugitive.",

        "Clint: All right.",
        "Kim: [Sigh] In the meantime, maybe I'll get my old job back, if they haven't replaced me already. They were pretty steamed about me leaving them to work for B.E. Jealous.",
