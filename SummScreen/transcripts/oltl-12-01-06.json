        "Natalie is there when John opens his eyes the next morning. She thought that his mother would have been there already. Natalie leaves the room to call her. Vincent is walking to the room and bumps into Natalie. She thanks him for what he did and for bringing John home to her. They hug. John watches them hugging from his bed. Spencer is put on the stand and he gets extremely angry when his very own lawyer seems to be asking him questions that are going to torpedo his case. He brings up the reason that Spencer came to town and how the man who he thought was his father really wasn't all these years. He goes over how it was his mother, on her deathbed who made Spencer promise to find Asa and make him pay for discarding her the way that he did. \"Now Mr. Truman Didn't she turn out to be a lying whore?\" Spencer flies out of his seat and tries to get to the man to punish him for talking about his mother this way. The guards hold him but then something unexpected happens. Spencer starts pointing at Blair when he sees her staring at him and he starts talking to her as if she were his mother. \"It's all your fault. It's all your fault ma. DID YOU KILL MY SON TOO?\" The crowd becomes quiet. Todd doesn't buy it and neither do Nora, nor Evangeline. The judge calls a recess and Spencer is taken out. When court resumes a couple of hours later, Spencer has composed himself and he calmly sits beside his counsel. His head lolls around like a toy dog in a car window, and he just can't seem to get his eyes off the ceiling. Mark moves to have his client declared unfit. \"I call my next witness Marty Saybrooke!\" All turn to and see Marty walking in. Vincent bumps into Natalie in front of John's room. She thanks him for helping her and they hug. John watches them through his window. She tells about the kiss and John remembers Vincent talking about it. Natalie tells Vincent later that she can't tell if John remembers that he was going to propose to her. Michael talks to John now and asks him if he remembers wanting to propose, and if he still wants to do that"

        "Nash: You know what? Your brother and I found a way to come to a truce. Maybe it's time you and I did the same, huh?",
        "Cristian: Why would I want to do that?",

        "Michael: How do you think Hugh would feel about the fact that you're going after his father for murdering my father?",
        "Evangeline: He knew, before the accident. He put the case together.",
        "Michael: Really?",
        "Nora: Besides, Hugh never thought of Spencer as his father, despite the relationship Spencer may have wanted.",
        "Evangeline: I wonder how Spencer is dealing with his son's death.",

        "Natalie: So, the defense presents their case today. But Evangeline's done an amazing job. I mean, I'm -- I'm quite sure she's going to get a conviction.",
        "John: I wish I could be there.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, we all do. But at least you're here. You know, John, I thought that you were gone. I'd have these dreams about you and me about our life together. And then I'd wake up. I never felt that empty before. Tell me this is not a dream.",

        "Vincent: Hey. Stop it. There's no need to thank me.",
        "Natalie: Are you kidding me? I mean, you -- you were the one who figured out that it was him. And -- and you came to me about it, and you put up with my crazy antics of me trying to prove it. And you kept me from going to jail for grave robbing.",
        "Vincent: Well, you know, that's a small price to pay to see you smiling again.",
        "Natalie: I thought I'd forgotten how, so thanks.",

        "Cristian: So you're wondering how she ended up with my brother.",
        "Nash: Nope. Stuff happens. You still think about her?",
        "Cristian: That was a long time ago. I've moved on, so has she.",

        "Jessica: First --",
        "Antonio: Ok, you're a hard habit to break.",
        "Jessica: Huh, I know. So do you have the rental car vouchers?",
        "Antonio: No, I gave them to you, remember?",
        "Jessica: No, I don't remember, but I guess if you were kissing me at the time, I would have been distracted.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, I promise to keep my hands to myself while you look for them.",
        "Jessica: Fine. That's a promise I hope you don't keep. Ok, ok, ok. Um -- Well --",

        "Rex: Todd. What are you doing here?",
        "Todd: Todd II's birthday.",
        "Rex: I know.",
        "Todd: And he wanted to come by and thank you. Thank you for bringing him back to me.",
        "Rex: You're welcome, Todd -- I mean, Todd --",
        "Todd II: It's Todd II, you idiot.",
        "Rex: Ow! Agh! You little --",
        "Todd: Well, Todd II, what did I tell you about kicking people? And dogs and hamsters?",
        "Rex: You're happy now, right? Blair's accepted Tommy-- I mean, Todd --",
        "Todd II: It's Todd II.",
        "Todd: Oh, boy. Yeah, everything was good until the incident.",
        "Adriana: \"The incident\"?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Chip off the old block got behind the wheel of my hot rod. The little bugger likes fast cars just like his old man.",
        "Adriana: Well, he didn't drive it, did he?",
        "Todd: Briefly. Blair tried to stop him. The whole thing was her fault, really.",
        "Rex: What happened?",
        "Todd: Well, Blair stood in the middle of the road, and Todd junior just -- he just ran her over.",
        "Adriana: Oh, my God. Is she ok?",
        "Todd: No, she didn't make it.",
        "Adriana: Oh, my God!",
        "Todd II: Accidents happen.",
        "Rex: No -- no -- no --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: No. I didn't kill Thomas Mc Bain. And why the hell are you asking that question?",
        "Mark: The question offends you?",
        "Spencer: Well, let me put it this way -- what reason would I have for killing a man who I didn't even know? Especially a police officer?",
        "Mark: You know the reason.",
        "Evangeline: Your honor, is that a question?",
        "Judge: She's right, Counselor. Are you looking for a mistrial here?",
        "Mark: Absolutely not, your honor. My client's life is at stake. I'm just asking for a little leeway in questioning him.",
        "Evangeline: Leeway? This is your witness. Your honor, he's making a mockery of this court.",
        "Mark: That's not my intention. There's a rationale behind these questions, your honor.",
        "Judge: Very well. But if you cross the line, Mr. Casey, I will hold you in contempt.",
        "Mark: Understood. Dr. Truman, do you know a man names Asa Buchanan?",
        "Evangeline: Objection. Relevance?",
        "Mark: I'll prove relevance.",
        "Judge: Go ahead. You can answer that question, Dr. Truman.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, sure, I -- I know Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Mark: Now, isn't it true that the only reason you came to Llanview in may of last year was to destroy him, and his family, because you believed yourself to be his long-lost son?",
        "Spencer: What are you doing? You're supposed to be defending me!",
        "Mark: And didn't you recently find out that you, too, had a son?",
        "Spencer: So what?",
        "Mark: And wasn't he recently killed in a car crash before you ever got to know him?",
        "Spencer: What kind of questions you asking? Whose side are you on?",
        "Mark: I'm on your side, Spencer, but I need to clarify a few things for the jury.",
        "Evangeline: Objection!",
        "Judge: Sustained! Stick to questions, Mr. Casey.",
        "Mark: All right. Um -- let's get back to Mr. Buchanan. You hate him, don't you?",
        "Spencer: Huh. Mark, listen --",
        "Mark: Just answer the question. Do you hate Asa Buchanan?",
        "Spencer: Yes.",
        "Mark: Because you believed that he got your mother pregnant and then threw her away like trash. He threw the both of you away, didn't he? That's what she told you on her deathbed, isn't it?",
        "Spencer: Yes.",
        "Mark: She said he threw her away, got her pregnant, ruined her life, and that it was up to you to make him pay for it.",
        "Spencer: Yes.",
        "Mark: But as it turns out, Asa Buchanan isn't your father, is he?",
        "Spencer: His sons say no, I'm not.",
        "Mark: The D.N.A. test says, as well. Now, doesn't the fact that you're not related to the Buchanans make your mother a lying whore?",
        "Spencer: You son of a bitch.",
        "Judge: Order! Order!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm really sorry.",
        "Vincent: For what?",
        "Natalie: For Hugh. I know he was a good friend.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. I wish it could have had a happier ending. But, hey, at least a good thing came out of this.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know. I can't seem to stop smiling.",
        "Vincent: Hmm. And I'll bet you John's smile is just as big. Not that I've seen John smile before, but --",
        "Natalie: Oh, stop.",
        "Vincent: Has he said anything about -- my visits? You know, back when I thought he was Hugh?",
        "Natalie: Well, John really hasn't said a whole lot since he's come out of surgery, but I'm assuming you're referring to when you told him that I kissed you.",
        "Vincent: I only said something because I thought he was Hugh.",
        "Natalie: Yes, I know. But I also td you that it didn't mean anything. But you know, I'm -- I'm sure John probably doesn't even remember you telling him.",
        "Vincent: I should go tell him.",
        "Natalie: No. If anything, I'll tell him.",
        "Vincent: You need backup?",
        "Natalie: I'll be fine.",
        "Vincent: Hey, you know what? You need to get back in there with John.",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Vincent: Ok?",

        "Adriana: Rex, I feel just as bad as you do about Blair, but her death is not your fault.",
        "Rex: I don't care what he said -- that monster ran her down on purpose.",
        "Adriana: And he may still have been a monster if he had stayed with Michael and Marcie. He can't escape his D.N.A.",
        "Rex: Well, what about Starr and jack? They're Todd's kids, too.",
        "Adriana: And they could have turned out just like Todd did.",
        "Rex: But we'll never know, will we, because of what Todd did to them.",
        "Adriana: I don't even want to go there. Look, all that matters is Michael and Marcie are safe.",
        "Rex: Do we know that for sure? They moved out of Llanview because of me.",
        "Adriana: They started fresh. I bet they have dozens of kids by now.",
        "Rex: You're right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't people throw out their garbage anymore?",
        "Marcie: Hey, buddy, leave it alone! This is my house, you jerk!",
        "Adriana: Marcie?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Marcie: Not a pretty picture, is it?",
        "Rex: No, you and Michael moved out of Llanview.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. We moved out of Llanview. It turns out we couldn't have kids. Michael started drinking. He lost his medical license. He disappeared. I spent all the money I had looking for him. I lost everything because of you!",
        "Adriana: All he did was tell the truth.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, which leads to my current career choice -- living outside of a cardboard box. Thanks a lot, Rex. Thanks for ruining my life!",
        "Adriana: No!",
        "Rex: No! [Rex pants]",
        "Adriana: Rex, what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So your mom said she'll be here in a few more hours. She told me to give you a kiss for her, but I know it's going to have to wait.",
        "John: Who says?",
        "Natalie: You are so bad.",
        "Natalie: Vincent stopped by. You know he and Hugh were college friends. So he's pretty -- pretty upset. Do you remember Vincent coming by to visit you when he thought you were Hugh?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: So I guess you remember him telling you that I kissed him?",
        "John: Yeah.",

        "Mark: She lied to you. She told you Asa Buchanan was your father.",
        "Spencer: She did not lie to me!",
        "Evangeline: Your honor, objection.",
        "Mark: But he's not your father. The D.N.A. proved it.",

        "Nash: Well, come on, you're with Evangeline now, right? You were with Jessica, you're with Evangeline. How did you get over Jessica?",

        "Rex: Well, they could come true.",

        "Rex: Well, it could turn into one. You know that Michael and Marcie would be devastated. Todd isn't any kind of role model for a kid.",
        "Adriana: Well, neither was my mother, but I turned out ok, right?",
        "Rex: The best. On the other hand, she didn't raise you.",

        "Blair: I'm -- I'm not your mother, Spencer.",

        "Natalie: John, I have to. You need to know the truth about this. I was having a really bad day. I was upset about you. And then I had to go try on these bridesmaids dresses for Jessica's wedding. I mean, everybody was talking about it. And I was trying really hard to pretend like I was into it, but I was missing you. And I felt like I was losing you. Like your -- your memory. And I know this sounds crazy, but I just -- I had to get away. I had to try and find you. So I went -- I went to your rooftop. But you weren't there. And I've been there alone before. Itust -- it never really felt that empty. Vincent showed up. And I just grabbed him, and I kissed him. But I did it because I was trying to bring you back. Which I couldn't, because you were here. How much do you hate me?",
        "John: I don't hate you. I -- I need extra morphine, but I don't hate you.",

        "Rex: And look at what it's put them through.",
        "Adriana: Well, going to prison wasn't his fault. I mean, he didn't kill Margaret, and the baby obviously is alive.",
        "Rex: But everyone thought it was a possibility because of who he is and who he'll always be.",
        "Adriana: Ok. Well, what if Tommy grows up to be exactly like Todd, despite Michael and Marcie?",

        "Rex: God knows what would have happened to me if Roxy hadn't placed me with my aunt. So I have to believe that Tommy is in better hands with Michael and Marcie. You're the farthest thing from a liar, so this is going to be really hard. But I can't keep quiet unless you back me up. I hate asking you this, but will you keep the secret, too?",

        "Marcie: Well, they said they had to find a qualified doctor to examine him.",
        "Todd: \"Qualified\" -- guaranteed Casey bought the best quack money could buy. Let's go in. Hey, Evangeline, any news?",
        "Evangeline: The judge was ready two hours ago, and the defense just asked for more time.",

        "Vincent: Good.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, I wasn't sure that John would be John when he got out of surgery, but it seems as though maybe I've gotten a better John. He said he loved me.",
        "Vincent: Hey, that's great.",

        "John: Like what?",
        "Michael: Like planning on proposing to Natalie when you got home? I was just wondering. I mean, you still want to marry her?",
