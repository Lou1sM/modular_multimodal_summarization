        "Viki is in awe when Charlie surprises her by showing her the new diner that he secretly built that looks exactly like the Bon Jour Cafe. It brings back all of the memories of when they first met. But it's right in Llanview and it's called the Buenos Dias. It's the same place that used to be Carlotta Vega's diner after it burned down. There are a few different parties of people who have some personal issues that make them uneasy about enjoying Thanksgiving dinner. But they all come together to share the festivities at the Buenos Dias. And they are all happy. Dorian and he family, Sara, the Vega brothers and their friends, Nora, Bo, Clint Rex and the group at Asa's house also go to the Buenos Dias. Marcie and Michael attend. And Noelle and Mo from Paris, TX come to visit and announce that they are engaged."

        "Viki: Did we just go back in time?",
        "Charlie: No.",
        "Viki: God, it seems like we did. A minute ago, I was in Llanview. Now I'm in Texas a year ago.",
        "Charlie: Well, we're not in Texas, and this is not the Bon-Jour.",
        "Viki: Well, you could've fooled me.",
        "Charlie: This is the, uh, Buenos D\u00edas. And I built it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Tout suite, benoit. To the ovens, you must take it out now. Perfect, perfect. Now, then, mes petite jeunes filles --",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: We'll continue with our lessons on des truffles. Now, the black truffle is not quite as savory as the white.",
        "Langston: It looks like a mushroom.",
        "Dorian: It doesn't cost like a mushroom. Take a smell, come on.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: I know, it's awful, isn't it? But -- but -- but, this truffle emits, um, well, shall we say, a pheromonal equivalent of, well, a male pig.",
        "Langston: And that's a good thing?",
        "Lola: That's why you use so little. You just shave off a little piece.",
        "Dorian: Oh -- oh, how marvelous that you have such culinary expertise, but then, of course, a con artist like you and your father, you need to know a little bit about a whole lot of things, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: I'm sorry.",
        "Cristian: For what?",
        "Vanessa: I -- I heard you arguing with Sarah, and that's my fault. I'm been thinking, maybe it's better if Lola and I just -- just go, before we ruin what you have with Sarah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Jealous? Why would I be jealous, right? I mean, who cares what's going on in my life? You have some half-naked woman climbing all over you, and you're too blind to see what's going on --",
        "Carlotta: Uh, hi.",
        "Sarah: Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: So every year, my grandpa Asa used to make the same exact speech over and over, and then my dad and uncles, they used to all make fun of him and do the same thing. Then he'd get really mad.",
        "[Matthew chuckles]",
        "Matthew: I guess you had to be there.",
        "Rex: Shane, you okay?",
        "Shane: Yeah, I was just wondering. Who's my grandpa?",
        "Rex: Yeah, who is his grandpa, Roxy?",
        "Charlie: Maybe -- maybe I should've waited. Maybe this is too much.",
        "Viki: Yeah, too much for the crazy lady that you found in her father's mausoleum with a crowbar.",
        "Charlie: Viki --",
        "Viki: Not your typical Thanksgiving morning, was it? Baking a pie or stuffing a turkey --",
        "Charlie: Come on, I'll take you home.",
        "Viki: No. Oh, no. When I make really stupid jokes, it means I'm getting myself together.",
        "Viki: You -- you rebuilt the Bon-Jour?",
        "Charlie: Carlotta wanted me to rebuild the diner, so she kind of just went along with my ideas.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "Charlie: I -- I guess I told her some of the story, and, Viki, a lot of people love you. She only wanted one change. So now, it's the Buenos Dias.",
        "Viki: Come here. Sit down. This is where I first saw you.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I was a recovering alcoholic who was just looking for his son, who hated my guts. And you came walking up with a pot of coffee in your hand and the prettiest smile that I have every seen. And that smile changed my life.",
        "Viki: And you did this? Wow. I guess I have a lot to be thankful for.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Did -- did Mom change her mind about coming down?",
        "Nora: Uh, no, sweetie, she's still not up to it. You know, it's just all those people that remember her that are going to be here that she has no memory of.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I get that.",
        "Nora: No, you don't.",
        "Cole: Yes, I do. It's me, she doesn't remember me, so -- so this kid she doesn't even know, it's this big mess --",
        "Nora: You're not a mess, okay? God, Cole, you're not a mess. You're grieving for your baby, that's all, and that's okay. It's an okay thing to do. Okay?",
        "Cole: I think -- I think I should just take off. I'm just going to bring everyone down.",
        "Clint: Cole, don't go.",
        "Cole: So you're giving me orders now?",
        "Nora: Cole --",
        "Clint: I meant, don't go before I've had a chance to apologize to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: I just love the old Thanksgiving traditions. Don't you, Langston?",
        "Langston: Yeah, like making new people feel judged and unwelcome. It kind of commemorates how the settlers in the new world ended up treating the Native Americans.",
        "Dorian: Back off, you two. Not that what you're saying about the Native Americans isn't true, but -- well, let -- I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: What did Lola ever do to you?",
        "Addie: Besides testify against her own father to send him to prison? Is that what you're talking about?",
        "Langston: Yes.",
        "Dorian: I said I'm sorry. This just isn't the Thanksgiving that I wanted to have.",
        "Addie: We know. We're worried about Starr, too. But if we can't make everything right for Starr, we can take care of --",
        "Dorian: Lola?",
        "Addie: Of Lola a little bit.",
        "Dorian: Yeah.",
        "Langston: She hasn't had a great time with it all either.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I just love it when the two of you teach me these little lessons in life. Lola? Lola?",
        "Lola: Yes, Dr. Lord?",
        "Dorian: I wonder if you wouldn't please teach us the proper way to shave a truffle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Oh, yes. Come on. Okay. All right, so Layla is showing Jamie and my mother the new puppy, so why don't you tell us what \"too blind to see half naked\" meant?",
        "Sarah: Huh?",
        "Talia: What you were muttering when you walked in the front door, honey.",
        "Sarah: You know, it's really not polite to listen in on a person when they're having a conversation with themself.",
        "Antonio: Well, we weren't given much of a choice. Look, you know, I think the cop in me just, you know, thinks that \"too blind to see half naked\" has something to do with Vanessa.",
        "Talia: Wait, were they half naked together doing --",
        "Sarah: No, no. No, no, no. Do you know what I really, really, really, really hate about your brother?",
        "Antonio: No, but I -- I think I'm about to find out.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, you are. Answer me this, why does Cristian have to be so damn nice?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't know exactly why you did this. But thank you.",
        "Charlie: Well, I know I've never enjoyed a job so much as I did this one. I mean, there are some days I just stopped working, sit down, remembering.",
        "Viki: It must've been so much work.",
        "Charlie: Never seemed like it.",
        "Charlie: Maybe I'm crazy. I just thought that even though it is a different language and kind of different food, I thought that maybe this place might just open up possibilities for you -- your hopes and dreams -- the way the Bon-Jour did for you.",
        "Viki: Thank you. It does. You forgot something.",
        "Charlie: I did?",
        "Viki: The gum under the counter.",
        "Charlie: Give it time.",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie. It was so simple being Viki D.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and Charlie B. We didn't know anything about each other then.",
        "Viki: No. And now you know pretty much everything about me. And simple, I'm not.",
        "Charlie: No. But you still have the prettiest smile.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm sorry for the way I treated you. I tried to make you feel as if you owed me something, which of course, you don't.",
        "Cole: Okay, it's fine.",
        "Clint: You didn't back down. In fact, you told me that you weren't afraid of me.",
        "Cole: I'm still not.",
        "Clint: I know that. Legally, this house belongs to Nora.",
        "Cole: Well, what, do you want me out?",
        "Clint: No, no, no. What I was going to say is, I always think of this house as belonging to Asa Buchanan. Cole, I know what you've been through for the past few days. And you've handled the death of your child like a man. You're helping your mother as a man should. And do you know something? I think Asa would really like you. And I think he'd be very happy to know that you and your mother are living in this house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Sarah: It's him. What do I do?",
        "Talia: For crying out loud -- hi, Cris. Mm-hmm, yeah, hang on. Please, try not to be crazy? Thanks.",
        "Sarah: Cris \u0096",
        "Sarah and Cristian: I'm sorry.",
        "Sarah: It's all my fault.",
        "Cristian: No, listen, your mom took off again on Thanksgiving, and I just should've been, you know, better.",
        "Sarah: Let's not talk about this on the phone. Will you -- will you come over, please? Your -- your whole family's here.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Oh --",
        "Sarah: Look, I know you have to bring Vanessa. Just get over here, please? Bye. He's bringing Vanessa.",
        "Talia: The judge said he had to, you know, stay with her at all times.",
        "Sarah: And Cristian always keeps his promises. Is it bad that I kind of want her to get deported?",
        "[Talia scoffs]",
        "Talia: She'd better be.",
        "Sarah: You know something. Talia, do you know something?",
        "Talia: Uh -- ahem, okay, I shouldn't tell you this. You have to promise me that you won't tell anyone else.",
        "Sarah: What?",
        "Talia: The only reason why I'm telling you is because Cristian's living with Vanessa.",
        "Sarah: Tell me!",
        "Talia: Oh, okay. I don't really know what to make of this, but right before Ray Montez got shipped back to Colombia, he said that he didn't kill Lola's mother. He said Vanessa framed him and got Lola on her side.",
        "Sarah: Oh, my God.",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Sarah: Do you believe him?",
        "Talia: I don't know. But if it's true, it means that Vanessa shot Ray to shut him up.",
        "Sarah: And that whole story about her protecting Lola --",
        "Talia: Is a bunch of crap.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I hope you're thirsty, because foxy Roxy has just whipped up a batch of my own original creation.",
        "Bo: Oh, Rox, you know what? I think I'm just going to stick with the beer, all right? It's a tradition.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, whatever floats your bloat.",
        "Rex: I'll try one, thanks.",
        "Roxy: Great. Does it need sweetener?",
        "Rex: No, no, it's really sweet, thanks.",
        "Roxy: Man, you don't know what you're missing.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "[Rex exhales]",
        "Rex: I think this is gin and chocolate syrup.",
        "Bo: You were real nice to your mom just now.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, maybe having a kid of your own makes you go easier on parents in general.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I cannot believe that you did this. You have no idea how much I've missed this place, and everyone who went with it.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, you don't really have to.",
        "Viki: Why, what do you mean?",
        "Viki: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh. Oh.",
        "Charlie: Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Viki: It's so good to see you. You clean up so good.",
        "Moe: You like my tie? In honor of the day.",
        "Viki: Moe, those little turkeys, tres -- tres chic. Oh, God, it's so good to see you.",
        "Moe: You, too.",
        "Viki: Were you in on this?",
        "Gigi: No, I'm afraid I was fairly busy. It was all Charlie's doing.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: This is very good, by the way.",
        "Cristian: I'm stuffed.",
        "Talia: I love the decorations. Hi, baby.",
        "Antonio: Hi. Jamie: Can I have the wish bone? I want to wish for a puppy like Sarah's.",
        "Antonio: You know, baby, before we start wishing for new things, why don't we give thanks, um, for all the things we already have. Like, um, like our family and our wonderful friends.",
        "Sarah: That we didn't drown.",
        "Cristian: That I'm here with all of you, thanks to you.",
        "Antonio: Uh, yeah. Uh, well, and that we're all here, happy, together. To old friends and -- and new ones. Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Sarah: Yeah.",
        "Everyone: Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Attention, everybody!",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Our grand presentation. Benoit, s'il vous plait. Ta-da!",
        "Langston: Ooh.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Now, we have to go directly into the dining room and eat this delicious feast before it gets cold.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, we wouldn't want any nasty sentiment to interfere with Dorian's schedule of Thanksgiving.",
        "Dorian: Oh, but excuse me. Pardon. It is not Thanksgiving, no.",
        "Blair: Oh, it's not?",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no, no. Our theme at La Boulaie is \"la fete de l'action de grace.\"",
        "Addie: That's some theme.",
        "Blair: Whatever.",
        "Dorian: Now, Jack, dear, why don't you lead the way into the dining room? Thank you. Benoit, oh, for goodness sakes. You're forgetting the roasted peppers.",
        "Chef: Lady, I keep telling you, it's \"Ben.\"",
        "Dorian: Ben, oui. Jack, honey, what are you, uh, doing down there? What are you looking for?",
        "Jack: Uh, the turkey?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Where is this famous turkey?",
        "Nora: Oh, I just called the caterer. And -- and they're on their way. They're swamped, but they promised me they're on their way, I -- I swear.",
        "Shane: So, that was your grandpa?",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "Shane: I never even had a grandpa. I -- I guess.",
        "Bo: All right, could everybody listen up for just a minute here? Huh. First, I'd like to say how much it means to everybody to have you here, Renee.",
        "Renee: Thank you, Bo.",
        "Bo: Ah. And I'd also like to thank that guy, right there, you, in the black shirt. I'd like to thank you for being a great friend when I -- when I really needed one. My son, Matthew, thanks for being a better kid than you are a shortstop.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Nora: Hey!",
        "Bo: Oh, no, no, no. This guy's a great, great shortstop. Thanks, son. And you, Shane. I want to thank you for, uh, helping my friend Balsom find his way back when he had every reason in the world to -- to give up. Good work, Shane. And, Roxy, you -- you know what? You showed me what real strength looks like. I mean, you -- you always really hang in there, even if you're scared to death. You do. Hey, Cole -- I just want to say, God bless you for having to handle what nobody should ever have to handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Jack, dear, we are not having turkey.",
        "Jack: But it's Thanksgiving.",
        "Dorian: Right. Instead, we are going to have canard au confit du bois.",
        "Blair: Hey, Blanche, how is it \"du bois\"?",
        "Dorian: \"Of the woods,\" Blair. That's why I had Benoit -- Ben -- place the duck on a bed of arugula.",
        "Starr: Where are the sweet potatoes with -- with the marshmallows? Aunt Dorian, we always have sweet potatoes with marshmallows.",
        "Dorian: Well, not this year, and not any year that we care about our carbs.",
        "Langston: Okay, guys, relax. We don't need to get all bent out of shape just because Dorian decides to do something different for a change. I mean, it's not like -- wait a minute, we don't have mashed potatoes?",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: I just want to say how much it means to me to have you all here. Such good friends and the family that I love so much.",
        "Noelle: I can't tell you much I have missed you.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey.",
        "Noelle: Oh, come see us, okay?",
        "Viki: What's that?",
        "Noelle: Moe and I are engaged.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, that's so wonder-- I knew you two were meant for each other. You know, when you told me how he got you back in the pie contest, I said, \"that's love.\"",
        "Noelle: Well, that was his, uh, what do you call it? His grand gesture.",
        "Viki: I think you got to love a guy who makes grand gestures.",
        "Noelle: Hmm. A girl would be a fool to let a guy like that get away.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: If Lola were here with me, I know she would join me in thanking Cristian and Sarah for being so welcoming. And I wanted to particularly thank Cristian for rescuing us from a man who would've stopped at nothing to see us dead.",
        "Sarah: That right?",
        "Vanessa: Excuse me?",
        "Sarah: You know, there is an alternative theory floating around out there.",
        "Talia: Sarah? Sarah?",
        "Vanessa: What are you talking about?",
        "Sarah: Montez says that you framed him for the murder of his wife and then tried to kill him so that no one would ever find out.",
        "Cristian: Well, what are you talking about, Sarah?",
        "Sarah: I'm talking about the other side of the story -- right, Talia?",
        "Talia: Sarah, I told you this in confidence.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, but I think this is --",
        "Antonio: You told her? She's angry and she's been drinking. And you think it's a good time to share?",
        "Vanessa: What exactly did Ray say to you?",
        "Antonio: Well, first of all, you know what? It's restricted information.",
        "Talia: Ahem.",
        "Antonio: Obviously, Officer Sahid here forgot that.",
        "Talia: Thanks. Wow. Jamie: Papi, are you mad at Talia?",
        "Vanessa: So that's what you think? You think -- you think I tried to frame Ray for murder?",
        "Layla: Wait a second. Why don't we just let this -- why don't we just let this go and eat Thanksgiving dinner --",
        "Vanessa: Wait, wait, wait -- how am I supposed to let this go? I'm being accused of murder and I'm just supposed to keep passing the sweet potatoes --",
        "Cristian: Listen --",
        "Sarah: You shouldn't even be here.",
        "Vanessa: I was invited.",
        "Cristian: I'm sorry, Vanessa. Sarah's just had a little too much to drink.",
        "Sarah: Oh, really? Really, is that what you think? Because I don't think I've had nearly enough.",
        "Layla: You know what? Sarah's mother came by this morning to tell her that she's leaving town. She's a little upset right now, Cristian.",
        "Talia: Cristian, you should've been there for her but you weren't.",
        "Antonio: My brother's only trying to do the right thing.",
        "Carlotta: Knock it off! Ah! Ahora mismo. I will not put up with this fighting. Not any day, but especially not -- not this day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Dorian, you're kind of in that place again.",
        "Dorian: What place?",
        "Addie: Where you're driving everybody crazy.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Well, I'm just trying to make sure that everything is festive.",
        "Blair: I know, but you're --",
        "Addie: Driving everybody crazy.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: I didn't get any sleep last night. I had to wake up Yvette and we, by hand, washed every bit of crystal and stemware in this house.",
        "Blair: Well, that was very sweet of you --",
        "Addie: But kind of crazy. What, I'm not supposed to say the word?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Dorian: I will get that. It's probably the delivery of the \u00e9clair and hand- dipped, chocolate-covered strawberries I ordered. I hope you don't think that's excessive, Addie, or crazy.",
        "Blair: Dorian.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: Mel. It's you.",
        "Mel: Hmm, just when you need me, sugar.",
        "Dorian: Don't call me that.",
        "Mel: I know you're trying to get everyone through this day like everything's okay, but it isn't. This is a sad Thanksgiving.",
        "Dorian: Well, I do have most of my family with me.",
        "Mel: Hmm. Well, I think you need to work on that because they're not seeing Dorian. They're seeing some psycho Julia Child who needs to cut back on her steroids.",
        "Dorian: I just don't want them to know \u0096",
        "Mel: See how sad you really are. They know, and they know that you love them, so why not just order a pizza and be happy that you're all together? Happy Thanksgiving, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Happy Thanksgiving, Mel.",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute. Mel: Hmm?",
        "Dorian: Where are the chocolate-covered strawberries?",
        "Mel: Oh. Damn, they were good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Charlie: You know, I didn't build this place just to drown you in nostalgia. I know that the past is the past and -- and there's nothing that can change that. But I'm trying to learn from it, and that last Thanksgiving gave me a glimpse of what life could be. And then, I think life kind of caught up with both of us. Things got pretty screwed up.

Charlie asked me if he could use it tonight so he could have a party and he really wanted us all to come, so I think it would be really nice if we all go over there and see the diner that your father built is still going on. And while we're at it, we can remember the fights that we had in that place and how they never changed how we felt about each other, just like now.",
