        "A young blonde woman named Aubrey arrives in Llanview. She tells her friend that she is there to meet her gentleman friend's family. She says no one else knows about the man she is seeing except a lady she met on the plane. Kelly arrives in Llanview and sees Joey at Llanfair. Recalling the advice she received from the woman sitting next to her on the airplane, she admits to him that she had gone to London to see him. Kelly tries to tell Joey that she still loves him, but things keep interrupting their conversation, the last of which is Aubrey calling Joey.",
        "Nora goes to the Buchanan mansion and tells Clint that he caused a fight between her and Bo because Clint created doubt in her mind. Inez goes to the police station and tells Bo that she and Clint broke up, but doesn't tell him that it is because Clint wants her to ruin Bo and Nora's marriage. BO asks her if the break up had anything to do with him. She admits that it did, but not in the way that he thinks. When she leaves Bo's office, she calls Clint and tells him that she told Bo that they broke up but she will not go through with Clint's plan because she thinks he is despicable and never wants to see him again. Clint then tells Nora that Inez broke up with him and that he thinks Bo is the reason. Nora grabs her coat and leaves without a word. She goes to the police station and tells Bo about the breakup, but she is not surprised that Inez already told him. He asks her why it matters if Inez has a crush on him. She says she thinks Inez is going to try to sleep with him. He shouts that he is not going to sleep with Inez and that he is not the one that cheats. Dumbfounded, Nora realizes that Bo may have forgiven her, but he will never forget what she did.",
        "Starr goes to Statesville after finding out that Cole had been in a fight. She confides to Blair that she is worried about Cole but he is worried about James Ford too, but that she is afraid to feel too much compassion for him because she is concerned that it will lead to something more. She says she feels that she would be betraying Cole. Blair tells her that it is alright for her to care about people. Todd tells Tea that when he saw James covering for his father after he gave him a black eye, it reminded him of his own behavior with his abusive father when he was younger. Tea says she is going to talk to Nora about bringing charges against Eddie. Todd says the police won't be able to keep Eddie in jail for long and that he knows Eddie will look for fresh blood to prey on when he is out of jail.",
        "Ford tells James that he got the money that Eddie is demanding and that he will not allow Eddie to hurt James again. A police officer comes to the door and tells them that Bo sent him to make sure Eddie didn't come back to bother them after being released from jail about an hour earlier. Ford tells James that when they give Eddie the 50,000, he will go away. James doubts that Eddie will ever leave them alone as long as he is alive. Eddie finds Danielle alone in Nate and Inez's apartment, waiting for Nate to come home. Nate arrives as Eddie is approaching Danielle in a lascivious manner and pulls him off of her and then sends Dani home. Nate demands to know what Eddie wants with Inez. When Eddie makes disrespectful comments about Danielle's body, Nate punches him. Inez arrives home and Eddie warns her to tell her boyfriend, Bo to back off because he has friends in even higher places. He tells her to advise her boys to man up and deal with the fact that he will do whatever he wants and they can do nothing about it. Inez tells Nate to lock himself in the apartment and she leaves, saying that she is going to make sure that Eddie can't hurt them anymore.",
        "Dani tells her parents that Nate's father arrived at Nate's place while she was waiting and said some crazy things. Tea asks Dani in confidence if Eddie walked in on anything embarrassing. Dani tells her that she and Nate are not having sex, but that they have talked about it. She says Nate has had sex before and that makes her feel like she is still a kid and Nate isn't. Tea tells Dani that she is still young, but she is intelligent and that she is confident that Dani will ask herself the right questions to make an informed decision. Todd gets his coat and leaves without a word. Todd finds Eddie in the hallway outside Inez's apartment and introduces himself. He says he heard Eddie enjoys beating up on his kids and that he doesn't like it. He tells him that his father was the same way, beat him up from time to time, but now he is dead. He warns Eddie that he'd better stay away from Danielle. Eddie goes to Bobby and James's apartment. Ford gives Eddie the 50K and tells him to take it and leave. Eddie says he isn't ready to leave.",
        "Ford promises James that they will get rid of Eddie. Inez goes to Clint's house and tells him that she will go along with his plan, seduce Bo, and ruin his marriage to Nora on the condition that Clint makes Eddie disappear. Nate calls Dani and tells her he is alright and that he would kill his father before he would ever let him touch her again. Todd confirms to Tea that he told Eddie that he would kill him if he comes near Dani again."

        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Starr: Well...",
        "Blair: The warden said that Cole wasn't hurt too badly, you know, in the fight.",
        "Starr: Too badly?",
        "Blair: Listen, I know that you're worried about him, and you're gonna see him in just a few minutes, and I could talk to John. You know, maybe he can do something about it.",
        "Starr: How?",
        "Blair: Well, maybe he's being picked on for being the new guy.",
        "Starr: This isn't high school, Mom. He was not picked on, he was attacked, okay? And I just can't stop thinking about what he's going through in this awful place.",
        "Blair: I know. I know, sweetheart. It's awful.",
        "Starr: That's not even the worst part about how I'm feeling.",
        "Blair: It's not?",
        "Starr: What's worse is that Cole's not even...the only guy that I'm worried about right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I just hope that you didn't have to do something sketchy to get your hands on that kind of cash.",
        "Ford: What does it matter? As long as dear old dad takes it and gets lost. And sooner rather than later. Hey, I'm not letting Eddie hurt you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Before all hell broke loose out there, you were going to tell me something about Clint.",
        "Inez: Yes, Clint. Clint and I broke up.",
        "Bo: You did? Why?",
        "Inez's voice: You want me to sleep with Bo? Why?",
        "Clint: He destroyed my marriage. You and I are gonna return the favor.",
        "Inez: It's complicated.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Dani: What the hell?",
        "[Wolf whistle]",
        "Eddie: Nice.",
        "Dani: Ha. Uh, I'm so sorry. I thought--",
        "Eddie: I know what you thought. Anticipating Nate, am I right? He's a lucky guy. He's about to get a lot luckier, isn't he, if he plays his cards right?",
        "Dani: Huh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: How much more can Estrella take? I mean, she's on her way to Statesville now 'cause Cole got in a fight?",
        "Todd: Cole's a loose cannon. For absolutely no reason.",
        "T\u00e9a: There was probably some reason, Todd.",
        "Todd: Then there's James Ford who has every reason to be explosive with that father of his.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry. What did you say? Can you repeat that?",
        "Todd: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: You just expressed sympathy for someone who's shown interest in your daughter. What's wrong with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Joey.",
        "Joey: Kelly. Oh, Kelly! Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: That's right. I'm in Llanview, Pennsylvania, and I think I'm gonna like it here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Kelly, you look fantastic.",
        "Kelly: So do you, Joey.",
        "Joey: What are you doing here in Llanfair?",
        "Kelly: Well, I, uh... it's because I heard you were here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I got a bone to pick with you.",
        "Clint: Good evening, Nora.",
        "Nora: I just had a big fight with my husband, and it's all your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I'm so glad to see you. I really want to catch up on everything, but what are you doing? I know, besides working on Todd's paper, I mean.",
        "Kelly: Not much. Not much. Actually, I was just in London.",
        "Joey: You were? I'm sorry I missed you. Bet Zane was ecstatic to have you come visit.",
        "Kelly: Uh, he was happier that we took him out for an early Thanksgiving dinner.",
        "Joey: Oh, the kid eats like a horse. He's grown up so much, hasn't he?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, don't remind me. Actually, Zane wasn't the only reason I went to London.",
        "Joey: Oh, yeah? What was the other reason?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Why are you blaming your fight with your husband on me?",
        "Nora: Oh, come on. If you hadn't spent all of Thanksgiving dinner just buzzing around and snipping in my ear all about how Inez has attraction for Bo and how she leans on him. Because of your own self-admitted paranoia, you made me crazy and start to doubt my husband!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Oh, look, it's none of my business. If you don't want to tell me why you Clint called it quits, you know, that's fine.",
        "Inez: No, no, it's all right. I guess, uh, it just wasn't working, I guess.",
        "Bo: Ah. I think there's something that I have to ask you.",
        "Inez: What is it?",
        "Bo: Well, I may be going out on a limb. I'm not even sure how to say it.",
        "Inez: Just ask.",
        "Bo: This breakup of yours with my brother... does that have anything to do with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I got to hand it to you, Nora. You're a born attorney. You can justify anything.",
        "Nora: What, you're not gonna take any responsibility for this?",
        "Clint: For what? You told me that your relationship with your husband is fragile and the reason for that is that I wanted to help?",
        "Nora: Help?",
        "Clint: Yeah. All I did was express my concern that Inez might have a little crush on Bo, and that took the bedrock of your marriage and made it crumble? This is a wonderful argument, Madam D.A.",
        "Nora: Oh, you know what? Don't joke about this, Clint.",
        "Clint: Who's joking? You told me yourself that you confronted Inez about her feelings for Bo.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and then Bo and I had a big ol' fight about it.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Nora: You're right, Clint. Inez looks for any excuse to go running to Bo to fix her problems and her ex, Eddie. Ugh. And Bo's only too willing to be her savior.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Whatever you did to get this 50k, just don't let it--",
        "Ford: Hey. Told you, don't worry about it.",
        "James: Bobby, wait. It's just-- it's just that you're doing really well right now. I mean, you're a college professor. I don't want you going and throwing that all away just for me.",
        "Ford: It's not possible. You're my kid brother, right? I got to look out for you. It's up to me to make sure that Eddie stays out of our lives.",
        "James: It's not all your responsibility.",
        "Ford: Oh, like hell it isn't. I know I should have done it a long time ago, and I took off instead, but not this time. I swear, James, he's never gonna lay a hand on you again. Go put some ice on that eye.",
        "James: Yeah. I'd forgotten how strong that old man really is.",
        "Ford: I didn't get how bad it got between you two until I saw for myself. He was like an animal when he hit you.",
        "James: I'm just sorry that you had to see that. Starr, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I will never forget the look on James' face when his dad hit him. It was like a mixture of fear and anger and shame and...Mom, it was horrible. My heart just broke for him.",
        "Blair: Starr, I'm sure that it did.",
        "Starr: I just wanted to tell him that it was all going to be okay, you know? That it wasn't his fault, that he didn't have to put up with his abusive father anymore, you know.",
        "Blair: And what's wrong with that? That's exactly what James needed to hear.",
        "Starr: Yes, it is, but... not from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, don't get me wrong. I'm not going soft on any of these horn dogs lusting after my daughter, including James Ford.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, that's good to hear.",
        "Todd: Hey, you remember when we were over at the Ford brothers' apartment and Hannah got the invitations to the wedding party? There was that guy there that was a little creepy looking?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. That guy that James said was a friend of the family. It was weird.",
        "Todd: Well, he wasn't exactly a friend of the family. He was their old man-- Eddie.",
        "T\u00e9a: That makes sense.",
        "Todd: Yes, and for a Thanksgiving present, Eddie Ford gave his son James a black eye.",
        "T\u00e9a: No way.",
        "Todd: Yeah. The worst part of it was when I was talking to James, he was...it was like he was covering for his father. You know, like he was ashamed and felt like it was his fault for letting it happen.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's the abuser's specialty: Make the victim feel like it's his fault.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, you could see it all over his face. Man, he was just feeling guilty and ashamed. Reminded me of someone I used to know.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Uh...",
        "Nate: What the hell?",
        "Eddie: You know, I'm sorry to interrupt your rendezvous with your little girlfriend.",
        "Dani: Um, Nate, my earring, I think it fell under the couch or something. I lost it.",
        "Eddie: Oh, sweetheart, here, let me help you.",
        "Nate: Hey, I thought I told you to leave her alone!",
        "Eddie: Whoa, whoa.",
        "Nate: And this is not a rendezvous.",
        "Eddie: Looks like it!",
        "Nate: You don't know what you're talking about, old man!",
        "Eddie: You know, I am no fool. Hell, I got with the program the minute I walked in here and saw missy all bent over the DVD player.",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Dani: You're disgusting!",
        "Eddie: Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Hey, Bobby. I really appreciate everything you're doing to try and get rid of Dad.",
        "Ford: Well, it's too little too late, but I'm not gonna let you down this time. At least he's out of commission for the night, right?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ford: You expecting somebody?",
        "James: Maybe it's Langston for you.",
        "Ford: Ha. Somehow I doubt that.",
        "Officer: Mr. Ford, is your brother on the premises?",
        "Ford: Uh, yeah. Why, something wrong?",
        "Officer: Commissioner Buchanan asked me to stop in, make sure your father wasn't bothering you.",
        "Ford: Our father?",
        "Officer: He was released about an hour ago.",
        "Ford: Released?",
        "James: Wait, from jail?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: This man beats his son after he's already sicced a hit man on him? First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna call Nora and see if I can build a case against James' father.",
        "Todd: Now, there's my ball and chain.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, seriously, come on. Starr cares about this boy, and James is seriously at risk. Do you think James would be willing to testify against his father?",
        "Todd: I have no idea. But I do know that old man Ford was thrown in jail tonight, but I don't think they can keep him long. And I know Eddie's type. He's a...he's the kind that preys on people that are weaker than him. So when he gets out, he's gonna look for fresh blood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: You shut your mouth. You should go home.",
        "Dani: What? No. Nate, I'm not leaving you here alone with him.",
        "Nate: I'll be fine.",
        "Dani: Are you serious?",
        "Nate: Dani, Dani, trust me, okay? My mom works at the police commissioner's office. I've got her on speed dial. If he tries anything, it'll be over.",
        "Eddie: Yeah, good luck with that. But don't worry. I got no beef with N-Nathaniel. Ha ha! I was just coming to catch up with my ex. Oh. Ooh.",
        "Dani: Oh, my God.",
        "Nate: Look, it's okay. Just go home. I'll call you later.",
        "Dani: You promise me?",
        "Nate: I promise.",
        "Dani: Okay.",
        "Nate: What the hell do you want with my mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Oh, look, Inez, I'm sorry. If I was out of line asking if your breakup with Clint had anything to do with me, but see, my wife right now, she's got all these crazy ideas--",
        "Inez: Yes, yes, Bo. The breakup did have something to do with you...and it didn't. Not in the way that you think.",
        "Bo: Oh. I'm not sure I understand.",
        "Inez: Just...don't worry. I just wanted you to hear from me that Clint and I won't be seeing each other again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You have a jet on standby, don't you?",
        "Clint: Always. What are you suggesting?",
        "Nora: I don't know. I was thinking that maybe you and Inez would like to take a little trip. I hear Madagascar is lovely this time of year.",
        "Clint: Huh.",
        "Nora: All year round, in fact.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Clint: Sorry. Clint Buchanan.",
        "Inez: I just told Bo that we broke up.",
        "Clint: Does that mean you're going ahead with our agreement?",
        "Inez: No, I'm not gonna do it. I think you're despicable, and I never want to see you again.",
        "Nora: Bad news?",
        "Clint: Yeah, kinda. Inez and I have broken up.",
        "Nora: Just now?",
        "Clint: No. It all happened a little earlier. I didn't want to tell you because...well, I think it might be bad news for you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: It's all good. He picked me up from the airport and brought me to this great hotel, and then he went off to see his family. No, I haven't met them. Soon. No, nobody knows about me except for you and some girl I met on the plane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: But you never told me what other reason besides Zane took you to London. Was it business?",
        "Aubrey: You're wondering how you can tell this guy you're in love with him, but how can you not tell him? You have to take the chance.",
        "Kelly: I went to London for you, Joey.",
        "Joey: You came to London to see me?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Joey: I would've loved to have seen you, too. I'm sorry I was out of the country.",
        "Kelly: Did you have a good time wherever you went?",
        "Joey: Definitely, and I would love to tell you all about it...",
        "Kelly: Good, great.",
        "Joey: But, Kelly, I get--we've known each other for a pretty long time, ever since we were kids, and I get the feeling that you're holding something back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Exactly. We talked and talked. I got to run, okay? So I will check back in after I meet the family. Ciao.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Aubrey: Who is it?",
        "Porter: Room service.",
        "Aubrey: Room service? Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't order anything.",
        "Porter: Special delivery.",
        "Aubrey: Oh. Thank you. \"Aubrey, I just left you in the room, but I miss you already. Love J.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: How about a drink?",
        "Joey: That's okay. I don't need one.",
        "Kelly: I do. I need a martini. I need a strong martini with gin. I need lots and lots of gin. Ha.",
        "Joey: Since when are you a martini girl?",
        "Kelly: Uh, well, you know, I don't know. Things change. Some things don't. Sometimes they just get stronger and stronger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Inez gave me this long song and dance about why she wanted to end it, about why we were gonna break up, but I didn't buy it...because I think it all comes down to her feelings for Bo.",
        "Eddie: Does mama bear know you were planning on doing it right in there? On mommy's sofa? Ha. Although Inez has probably entertained quite a few of her gentlemen friends in here herself.",
        "Nate: I'm warning you.",
        "Eddie: Oh, no blame. No. That Dani, for a little girl, she's got quite a pair! Ooh, daddy's boy! Huh. Aw, you shouldn't have done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: There's no reason at all that you can't show compassion in your heart for James. From what you've told me, this boy has had to deal with so much abuse from his father all of his life, and that can lead to a lifetime of scars, sweetheart. I mean, especially if he feels isolated and powerless. He's the victim here. And you know what? He needs your friendship.",
        "Starr: And I want to be there for him, Mom, I do, but I--",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Starr: We've tried to be just friends, and it doesn't--if I let myself feel too much sympathy or too much compassion, then--",
        "Blair: What? You think that it's gonna lead to something more?",
        "Starr: I just can't go there, Mom. I promised Cole that I would wait for him, and if I let myself feel something for James, then it would be a betrayal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Bobby, dude, I am so screwed.",
        "Ford: No. No, you're not.",
        "James: Do you have any idea how mad Dad's gonna be at me?",
        "Ford: He's gonna forget all about it once he sees this. We're gonna pay him off and that's gonna be the end of it, okay?",
        "James: It's never gonna be the end of it, Bobby. It's just like Starr's dad said. The only way that we are truly ever gonna be free of him is if he's dead. And trust me, that thought has definitely crossed my mind.",
        "Ford: Wait. What do you mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I'm glad you were there to, you know, advise James.",
        "Todd: What am I, a social worker? Sounds like it was a bonding moment. It was not a bonding moment. I don't bond... especially when someone's trying to get in my daughter's pants. The only advice I gave him was to try to get rid of the scum.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Dani: Hey. Hey, guys, um, I'm going to bed. Good night.",
        "T\u00e9a: Whoa! Nice try. What's going on?",
        "Dani: Nothing is going on.",
        "Todd: Something happen with... with Nate?",
        "Dani: No. No. I'm just tired, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: What's bothering you?",
        "Dani: Um...all right, we were-- we were at Nate's mom's house, and Nate had to run out for a little bit, and, um, Nate's dad showed up.",
        "T\u00e9a: You were there alone?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",

        "James: Maybe the booze got to his brain even more. Man, I don't know. I don't know. He would come home more and more hammered, man, and he'd-- he'd slap me around just whenever he felt like it. Maybe there was an oil stain on the driveway or maybe he didn't like the smell of whatever I microwaved for dinner. Man, it could have been anything or nothing, and I'd be lucky if he'd come home and just pass out snoring with the lights all on and everything. And he--he used to smoke a lot of cigars back then, Bobby, and...I used to fantasize about putting a lit one in between his fingers and setting that bed on fire.",

        "Dani: Huh. So what, am I in trouble?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, mija, of course not. But the decision to have sex is a big one, okay? And whether or not Nate has experience should not factor into that decision.",
        "Dani: I know that.",

        "T\u00e9a: No. No, not dumb. Intelligent and talented and beautiful, and this is your decision to make, okay? But as your mother, I want to know that you're asking yourself the right questions.",
        "Dani: Like what?",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you trust Nate with your feelings? Do you trust him with your body? Do you feel close enough to him to want to be physically intimate with him? And do you know what you need to know to be careful and safe?",
