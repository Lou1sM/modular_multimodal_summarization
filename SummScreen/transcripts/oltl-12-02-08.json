        "Starr goes to confront her father for what he did. He admits that he was ready to steal her baby and run away with Marty to raise the baby. Marty motivated him to be a better man, and he fell in love with her. Marty admits to Nora that she still feels herself in love with Todd and unable to remember him as her rapist. Nora shares with Marty that she felt similarly betrayed by loving Daniel Colson. Dr. Joplin calls Marcie, Michael, Dorian, Blair and Starr to her office after getting the autopsy report on Starr's baby. It looks like she failed to see something she was completely incapable of seeing. She admits to them that she blames herself for the baby's death."

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Officer: Someone's here to see you.",
        "Todd: Well, I don't want to see anyone.",
        "Officer: She's pretty insistent.",
        "Todd: \"She\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, Johnny boy. I saw you on television. You gave the mayor hell. Did you actually tell him to take your job and shove it?",
        "John: Something like that.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Listen, I got to tell you, you got a pair of big ones to quit your daily grind in this shaky economic time. Honestly, I know why you're here.",
        "John: Why is that?",
        "Roxy: I saw the sign out there -- \"fry cook, bus boy.\" Man, it ain't great, but it's a living. And Marty's alive and kicking -- oh, wait till I tell Miles. He's going to drop his box --",
        "John: No, Roxy, no -- no Laurence. Marty's got enough to deal with.",
        "Roxy: Well, I actually think that you have more to deal with. You've got a big decision to make. So who's it going to be -- Marty or Blair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Now, that is a sad sight.",
        "Dorian: It's going to be a very happy sight on the food line at St. James.",
        "Blair: Wow, you're going to donate all your French Thanksgiving feast?",
        "Dorian: Pourquoi pas? I'm not going to waste all this glorious food just because my family has the palate of peasants.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Blair: Dorian, we were all together for Thanksgiving. Let's just be grateful for that, okay?",
        "Dorian: Why is it that the holidays can just break your heart?",
        "Blair: You know, speaking of broken hearts, do you know where my daughter is? She's not up in her room.",
        "Dorian: Starr left with Langston.",
        "Blair: You mean, she went to school? Dorian, she just gave birth.",
        "Dorian: I know that, but she said she wanted to get back and who can blame her? We all need to get back to some normalcy.",
        "Blair: Oh -- normal? She's 16, her baby dies with no explanation -- you call that normal?",
        "Dorian: We're going to get explanations. We're going to get a lot of our questions answered, like why was that baby never admitted to the neonatal I.C.U.?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Dr. Joplin: Come in. Morning, Bob. What, no coffee, no bagel?",
        "Bob: Um, just this -- the complete autopsy on the Manning baby? I put a rush on it like you asked.",
        "Dr. Joplin: So, what are we looking at?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry. The baby should not have died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Can I be alone with him?",
        "Todd: How are you?",
        "Starr: I just need to know one thing.",
        "Todd: Okay.",
        "Starr: Were you really planning on stealing my baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, hey.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Michael: I was hoping you'd sleep in.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, me, too, but I just couldn't seem to shut my mind off.",
        "Michael: Were you up all night?",
        "Marcie: Yes, I should've given you the bed and taken the couch.",
        "Michael: Oh, please, I slept fine. I mean, I've been couch surfing at John's for weeks. I'm used to it.",
        "Marcie: Hmm. You know what? Let me at least make you a cup of coffee, okay?",
        "Michael: What -- no. I actually, I have to get to the hospital because I've got a bunch of bright-eyed and bushy-tailed interns that I got to break in --",
        "Marcie: Hmm.",
        "Michael: Or break down, or however you want to call it.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, do you think I could maybe hitch a ride with you?",
        "Michael: To the hospital?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Yeah, sure.",
        "Marcie: Okay, thanks.",
        "Michael: Can I ask why you want to go to the hospital?",
        "Marcie: Um -- well, I accept the fact that Hope is gone. I do. But I just -- I need to ask Dr. Joplin why my baby died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Joplin: Well, this just doesn't make sense. It just -- how could this have happened?",
        "Bob: Dr. Joplin, how could you have missed it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Whatever the reason was, Starr deserves to know the truth. It may even help her heal. Knowledge is power.",
        "Blair: Yeah. She found out her dad was going to steal her baby. How much more knowledge do you think Starr can take?",
        "Dorian: So you do think that Todd's plans had something to do with that baby dying?",
        "Blair: No, I don't. I told you that and I don't want to talk about it with you, all right?",
        "Dorian: Help me pack up the food, please.",
        "Blair: Okay. It just -- it just kind of bugs me that Starr went up to school and didn't tell me. It doesn't bug you?",
        "Dorian: No, because she says she wants to go back to school and start being a normal teenager again. I -- you know, the -- that -- that never-ending search for normalcy.",
        "Blair: Well, if she finds some, I think I need to grab it.",
        "Dorian: Oh? Well, you're pretty much off to a good start.",
        "Blair: What are you talking about?",
        "Dorian: John spent the night here with you. So -- ahem -- in a way, that's a positive sign.",
        "Blair: It's a sign all right, but it's not what you're thinking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Waitress, I --",
        "Waitress: One second.",
        "Roxy: You know, on the one hand, you got Marty and her son and I know they're going through hell, and then on the other side, you got Blair --",
        "John: Lord, why are you doing this to me? I've tried to live a good life.",
        "Roxy: But, you know, Marty is, like, hot. I mean, she's really looking hot. Who would ever think that her brain got scrambled?",
        "John: All right, stop, stop.",
        "Roxy: No, I'm paying her -- hey, I'm paying her a compliment. All right, I know you're over her and you're on to Blair and she's not exactly chopped liver. And I know you got yourself one hell of a conundrum. Did I use the wrong word?",
        "John: No, actually, no.",
        "Roxy: Would you like to hear my theory?",
        "John: Not really.",
        "Roxy: Okay. You got Marty and Marty's probably licking her wounds, and Blair is getting ready to do battle, so which is more your type?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Good morning, sunshine. I have got some breakfast here for you.",
        "Marty: Ah, thank you. Hmm. Hey, I'm sorry I didn't make it down for Thanksgiving.",
        "Nora: Oh, come on -- I completely understand.",
        "Marty: I just didn't really feel like a, you know, family gathering --",
        "Nora: Marty, Marty?",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Nora: Stop apologizing. I completely understand.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "Nora: Did something else happen? Todd didn't try to contact you, did he?",
        "Marty: Ahem -- only in my nightmares.",
        "Nora: Oh, you had a bad dream.",
        "Marty: Yeah, you could call it a vivid memory, which should be a good thing for an amnesiac. Only when the only thing you dream about is falling in love with Todd, you wish -- well, it makes you wish you would lose your memory all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Sweetie, I just can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened with your baby. It doesn't matter that you were going to put her up for adoption. You carried her for nine months and to lose her like that is just -- well, my heart breaks for you. It really does.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah?",
        "Todd: You're the best part of me. You've always been the best part of me, honey. I wouldn't wish what happened to you on you in a million years. God, I've made so many mistakes.",
        "Starr: You're not answering my question, Dad. Were you planning on stealing my baby? Dad, you told me that you loved me.",
        "Todd: I do love you, Starr.",
        "Starr: You said that you made peace with Marcie taking my baby. You told Marcie herself that you thought that she would be a good mother. Were they all lies? Were they all just to fake us out? So you wouldn't be suspected when my baby turned up missing?",
        "Todd: It's more complicated than that, honey.",
        "Starr: I know what you did to Cole's mom. I can't believe that you're my father. I really can't, and I -- I can't stand that you are. And this is the last place on the planet that I want to be right now, trust me. I don't want to be anywhere near you, but I am here. I came here and the least you could do is have the decency, is to have the guts to tell me the damn truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marcie, do you really want to do this now? Do you really want to know the details of how the baby died now?",
        "Marcie: No, Michael, I don't. But I need some kind of explanation, Michael. I have put so much into this baby.",
        "Michael: I know.",
        "Marcie: I mean, for months now, I have been living for her. I've been planning for her, for our lives together. I mean, for God's sakes, Michael, I gave you up for her. So I -- I need to know, I need to know why it ended before it ever began.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Joplin: No, this report -- it can't be right. You must have made a mis\u0097",
        "Bob: I triple-checked just to be sure. There are no mistakes. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to stand by my findings.",
        "Dr. Joplin: I thought if -- um -- I've had a -- I've had a lot on my mind the last few months. Bob: You should've said something or taken some time off. You're the best O.B. I know.",
        "Dr. Joplin: No, to -- to miss something like this, it's -- uh -- it's inexcusable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Losing this kid must've been just the worst thing that's ever happened to you, huh? Well, I'm going to help you through it.",
        "Starr: Help me by telling me the truth. Tell me the truth.",
        "Todd: I'm going to tell you the truth. I love you -- now, that's true. You know that.",
        "Starr: Were you planning on stealing my baby? Or was that just another lie you told Marty to make her happy while you were lying to her about everything else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You loved Todd because you thought he was someone else. That's the lie he fed you.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I keep telling myself that, but the bottom line is I fell in love with him.",
        "Nora: You fell in love with the illusion that he created.",
        "Marty: You know, you can call it whatever you want, but he was the one in the room with me. He was in the house with me every day. He was the one who -- who made sure I took my medication. He brought me food, he gave me clothes, and when he walked in the room, I got butterflies.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Marty: I fell for him, I slept with him, and I disgust myself!",
        "Nora: Okay. Your love was pure and honorable. Save your disgust for Todd because he completely manipulated you.",
        "Marty: I know.",
        "Nora: Marty, I don't think this is something that you should have to go through by yourself. There are so many wonderful therapists here in Llanview.",
        "Marty: Okay, and, yeah, what am I going to tell my therapist, huh? How is he going to help me deal with the fact --",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: I can't even say it -- that I -- I actually still miss him, my rapist! Oh, God, I can't live like this.",
        "Nora: Okay. We're going to help you through this, Marty. I promise we'll help you through this.",
        "Marty: How, how? I go to sleep to nightmares, I wake up and it's worse. I have so much rage and so much shame and so much disgust that I could die.",
        "Nora: No. You don't want to die -- you know what you want to do? You want to kill the S.O.B. -- that's what you want to do -- and then you want to climb into a hole and never come out again. Trust me -- I know exactly what you're going through.",
        "Marty: You know what it's like to be in love with someone who violated you?",
        "Nora: God help me, yes, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Was it your plan the whole time to steal my baby? Or was it just one of the lies you told Marty?",
        "Todd: Starr --",
        "Starr: Answer me. Was it the plan? Or did my baby dying wreck it all for you? Huh, is that what it meant to you?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Starr: Stop playing with me, damn it. It is you and me. It's no lawyers, no cops. It's just you and me.",
        "Todd: Yeah, and I want to do something to help you.",
        "Starr: Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth right now -- were you planning on stealing my baby?",
        "Todd: Yes. Yes, I was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: When John arrived, he was wiped out. He was exhausted mentally and physically, so we slept.",
        "Dorian: Together.",
        "Blair: We were asleep, conked out.",
        "Dorian: And then?",
        "Blair: And then, we woke up and we played a little cards.",
        "Dorian: Strip poker -- fabulous foreplay.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, this is not high school. We were fully clothed, Dorian. Good Lord.",
        "Dorian: You're a woman fighting against the ghost of Marty past. I mean, who could blame you for using everything you've got to fight back?",
        "Blair: Well, I really don't think it was appropriate for me to throw myself at John given the day that he'd had at your home with all the children around. I just -- John -- he just needed to be alone or with someone and -- and not talk.",
        "Dorian: Crisis or no crisis, men never like to talk.",
        "Blair: Oh, Dorian, he just lost his job, a job that means everything to him. He's a cop. His dad was a cop. He has to start over and he doesn't even know where to begin. He just needed to be still and think.",
        "Dorian: And what about what you needed?",
        "Blair: I got it.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Blair: John. He turned to me.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: It's my treat. I know I ask a lot of questions, but I really care about you, Johnny.",
        "John: And I appreciate that, Roxy, but I don't want to talk about my personal life --",
        "Roxy: But maybe you should --",
        "John: With anyone.",
        "Roxy: Not even me?",
        "John: Not even you. Look, I just -- came in here. I just want to order some breakfast and eat it nice and slowly.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, slow eating -- it's a good trend, one little bite at a time.",
        "John: For the first time in a long time. I don't want to have to scarf something down on my drive into work.",
        "Roxy: All right, good times -- no clock to punch.",
        "John: There you go.",
        "[Roxy chuckles]",
        "Roxy: But, you know, even a good breakfast -- you know, that costs money and it's really hard when you're one paycheck away from food stamps. You know what I'm saying. Look, Johnny, I know you're out of work and --",
        "John: All right. Roxy, listen, I'm -- I'm doing okay right now. Okay? So for -- for a little while, I just want to enjoy the little things in life like -- like reading the paper --",
        "Roxy: Uh-huh.",
        "John: And having a good cup of coffee and not having to talk to anybody.",
        "Roxy: Kind of like going to a retreat, like, in the mountains with the monks. You don't talk for days, just quiet.",
        "John: Yeah. Now, doesn't that sound good?",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, man, that sounds great, just quiet so you can mediate.",
        "John: In silence.",
        "Roxy: Shh -- no talking.",
        "John: Yes.",
        "Roxy: So how's Marty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What do you mean, \"you know what it's like\"? Did the same thing happen to you? It wasn't Todd, was it?",
        "Nora: Oh, no, God, no. No, no, it wasn't. No. No, but I do know what it's like to love someone who's concealing who they really are -- and what it does to you when you find out the truth.",
        "Marty: Can you tell me what happened?",
        "Nora: His name was Daniel Colson, and I loved him, so I married him. But like you, I found out too late that I loved the man he told me he was, the man he showed me he was, but not the man he actually was.",
        "Marty: Who was he actually?",
        "Nora: He was a politician. He was up and coming, very ambitious, handsome.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: Hmm. And he was gay.",
        "Marty: And he married you?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well, like I said, he was very ambitious. And he had convinced himself that he couldn't have everything that he wanted unless he lied, so he did. He married me -- I was his beard.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: Then he lied to me, he lied to everyone. And when those lies started to catch up with him, he went to great lengths -- he went to unimaginably dark lengths to keep his secret from coming out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: That baby was mine. She was not yours.",
        "Todd: Yes, but when Marcie took Sam, you know, it killed me. You remember that time?",
        "Starr: You got Sam back.",
        "Todd: Well, yeah, but -- but only until Marcie was able to convince a judge that I was a danger to him.",
        "Starr: Oh, God.",
        "Todd: And now, you know, thanks to Marcie and your mother, I am not legally allowed to come within a hundred feet of you or your brothers. You know, I can't see my own kids and -- and then I hear you're going to give this baby to -- to Marcie, this woman who stole, who kidnapped my son and held your Aunt Viki hostage at gunpoint and I just --",
        "Starr: She thought that she was never going to see Sam again, and she went crazy. You know, let's think about it for a second -- have you ever gone crazy, Dad?",
        "Todd: Come on. Sweetheart, I just was convinced that -- that you were giving her your baby to spite me.",
        "Starr: So your only choice left, then, was to steal it.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry. I thought that if I could have this baby and I could raise it like -- like a Manning, you know, with the kind of love that I had for you and Jack and Sam, that maybe someday when you were older, I would tell you what I did, and when you were ready, I would give her back to you. And by then, I'd be able to explain myself and, of course, I thought you'd forgive me.",
        "Starr: Oh. You're lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I'm sorry. You know, this is not all on you.",
        "[Dr. Joplin chuckles]",
        "Dr. Joplin: Who else is it on, Bob?",
        "Bob: Even if you miss this, the baby still could've been saved with a transfusion in the NICU. The fault is on them as much as it is on you. Sorry. I really am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Starr -- I promise you, I'm telling you the truth right now.",
        "Starr: You told -- you told Marty that I was -- don't touch me, Dad. You told Marty that I was going to give you my baby to raise? And the two of you were going to go away somewhere and just raise her together, huh? And now you're telling me that you were going to bring her back to me when I was ready to raise her. Either you were lying to Marty then or you're lying to me now. You just wanted to steal that baby. Not for me, not for the baby, but for you, because it's always about you.",
        "Todd: No, no!",
        "Starr: \"No\" what?",
        "Todd: You don't know the whole story.",
        "Starr: I don't? How could you do that, huh? How could you think of doing something so awful? Did you really think that you were going to get away with it? You were just going to walk out of the hospital with my baby in your own hands.",
        "Todd: It doesn't matter.",
        "Starr: It matters if I say it matters.",
        "Todd: I changed my mind. I changed my mind. I showed up at the hospital, and I saw Marcie there, and I couldn't do it. Actually, you know, I had already changed my mind before I got to the hospital. I said, \"I can't hurt her, I can't hurt my daughter this way.\" I changed my mind, you see. And I didn't know about the baby until Cole told me later. You see, I tried to do the right thing. I tried to do the right thing, but it was too late.",
        "Starr: How could you do this to me Dad? How could you do it? Huh, you really thought that you were going to live happily ever after with my baby? With you and Marty raising her?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I did.",
        "Starr: Marty -- I mean, what -- how -- why?",
        "Todd: I fell in love with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So when does it stop?",
        "Nora: What, the feelings?",
        "Marty: And the hell that you went through. What I'm going through, when does this stop?",
        "Nora: Well, I'd like to say it -- it stops all at once, but it doesn't. I wish it did. It just, um, fades like an old wound that turns to a scar. It just fades -- slowly.",
        "Marty: But I'm so twisted up inside.",
        "Marty: I loathe Todd with such a passion, I can't describe it. But he's the same man I was in love with two nights ago.",
        "Nora: All right --",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Nora: Maybe you can understand this distinction. Look at me. You don't --",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Nora: Love the man. You are in love with the lie. Okay? That's what helped me understand the mess in my darkest hours, helped me come to terms with the fact that the man I love could betray me in such a despicable fashion. And, Marty, you will get past it. You got to go through it to get past it, but you will. You'll get through it, you'll get to the other side, I promise you, you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What are you doing about Todd?",
        "Blair: What am I doing about Todd? I'm at a loss to even remember what I saw in that man.",
        "Dorian: Hallelujah. And John's a much better match for you.",
        "Blair: Well, look at you. You actually approve of a man that I'm seeing.",

        "Blair: Dorian, just let me handle this my way, okay?",
        "Dorian: Right, right. Before John came to see you, did he go to see Marty first?",
        "Blair: Okay, you know, I see where you're going with this, and I know you love me, I know you care about me, but I'm just going to tell you this right now. John and I need to be with someone that we feel comfortable with. We feel comfortable with each other, okay?",
        "Dorian: Comfort is something you look for in a chair.",
        "Blair: What are you getting at here?",

        "Nora: I know that I tried to, like, dissipate a lot of the anger. I took it out on people. I, ooh, I let Bo have it, yes. Oh, he was the man who publicly outed Daniel, yes. He was also an ex-husband. Oh, that's such a long story, never mind. And then, I -- I should've had therapy is what I should have had, but I didn't, and so, a lot of it manifested itself in the physical, and I -- I became ill for a while. So, that wasn't good either. I threw myself into my job. And I think the one thing that really helped me was being a mother to my son. I really -- he was such a young boy, and he needed me -- he needed me to help him understand what happened and move on.",

        "Nora: What happened to you is so wrong, there is no making it right. But there is payback. My ex-husband is in prison. And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that Todd manning ends up there, too.",
        "Marty: Prison, huh?",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm. I know, it's a small consolation, but -- come on, you know what? Let's get out of here, let's go.",

And she's made me feel things that I didn't think I could feel again. I mean, of course, it's kind of silly, huh? Her of all people, the one person I should probably never have feelings for. But I'll tell you this -- no matter what you think, no matter what anyone thinks, my relationship with her was what kept me from taking your kid. And I did -- I do love her dearly.
