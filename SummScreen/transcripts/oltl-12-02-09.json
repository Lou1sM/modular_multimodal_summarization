        "Minister: He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies.",
        "[Congregation murmuring]",
        "[All gasp]",
        "Mitch: Well, don't look so surprised. It's not like this is the first time I've come back from the dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Guy faked his own death?",
        "Layla: Twice.",
        "Oliver: How could someone do that?",
        "Layla: Not that hard if you're crazy.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but come on. This is beyond crazy. Hey, hey, I'm not finished with that.",
        "Layla: Shouldn't you be out fighting crime or something?",
        "Oliver: No, I am riding the desk until the mayor's swearing-in.",
        "Layla: You better make sure you keep that crowd in line. You have to be home in time for your big date.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, right.",
        "Layla: It's tonight, right? You and Kyle finally?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, you know, it's not that big a deal.",
        "Layla: Excuse me? You came out on live TV. Millions of people watched you get together. Now they all want to know how it turns out for Kyle and Fish.",
        "Oliver: You make us sound like we're a reality show.",
        "Layla: You're not nervous, are you?",
        "Oliver: I...",
        "Layla: What's the problem? You love Kyle, and he loves you.",
        "Oliver: You know, I just...",
        "Layla: What? Tell me.",
        "Oliver: I just--I don't want to disappoint him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Hi.",
        "Nick: Late for the hospital?",
        "Kyle: How did you know that?",
        "Nick: You always take the shortcut when you're late.",
        "Kyle: Yeah. You here for Dr. Lord's swearing-in?",
        "Nick: I did help get her elected.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I meant to tell you congratulations on that.",
        "Nick: Let's hold off on the congratulations until she makes good on her campaign promise.",
        "Kyle: Why? You worried she's not gonna follow through with the marriage licenses?",
        "Nick: I'd be more worried if you hadn't dumped me at the altar. I've learned not to get my hopes up thanks to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: So, that's what I edited so far.",
        "Langston: Every time I see this, I feel so happy for Kyle and Fish, but what about poor Nick? What's gonna happen to him?",
        "Cole: You sound like you know them.",
        "Langston: Well, I feel like I do. That's what a good storyteller does.",
        "Markko: What storyteller? I'm just a dude with a camera.",
        "Langston: Oh, please. The whole world is gonna know your name by the time you're finished with that documentary.",
        "Cole: Wait, what documentary?",
        "Markko: \"Dorian's Road to City Hall.\"",
        "Starr: You're making a movie about Aunt Dorian?",
        "Langston: He's trying to make up for not voting for her.",
        "Markko: Like that's possible. Dorian pretty much hates me now.",
        "Langston: She does not hate you.",
        "Dorian: Why don't you let me speak for myself? Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Such a pleasure to see you all again.",
        "Bo: You're with me, Brody.",
        "Natalie: Where is he?",
        "Mitch: Nat.",
        "Natalie: What did you do with him?",
        "John: Don't do this.",
        "Charlie: Where is my son?",
        "Bo: Tell him, Laurence.",
        "Mitch: Well, I wish I could tell you he's in a better place.",
        "Natalie: Where is he?",
        "Mitch: But he did, after all, kill at least two people. Geez, I hope you didn't dress him too warm, Charles.",
        "Charlie: You son of a bitch!",
        "Clint: Charlie! Charlie, go!",
        "Bo: Take it easy.",
        "Charlie: Let me at him!",
        "Bo: No, take it easy.",
        "Mitch: Thank you, gentlemen. I didn't anticipate needing protection at a funeral. People just have no respect for the dead these--",
        "Charlie: You shut your mouth!",
        "Bo: Charlie! Charlie! You're giving him what he wants.",
        "Viki: Darling, please let Bo handle this.",

        "Mitch: Jared's body?",
        "Viki: God, you are evil.",
        "Mitch: Oh, Jared's body! Jared's body. It's back at the funeral home. Guess what? He was kind enough to give me his invitation.",
        "[Congregation groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Markko, I do not hate you for having voted for Viki instead of me.",
        "Markko: Even though my vote cost you the election?",
        "Dorian: That's water under the bridge. You made a mistake. Fate stepped in to correct it.",
        "Starr: Couldn't fate have had a better game plan? Natalie lost her husband. Charlie lost his son. Jessica's world is turned upside-down, and Aunt Viki--",
        "Dorian: No, no, darling. I was speaking of fate in the abstract.",
        "Starr: Right, bu--",
        "Dorian: And I did not mean to infer that Jared's death was anything but a catastrophe. One can only imagine the terrible pain that his family is going through. And Viki deciding to stand by her family instead of her own best interests, well, that's nothing short of heroic.",
        "Langston: Do you really mean that?",
        "Dorian: Oh, absolutely. I would do anything to change the circumstances that brought me into this position. But now that I'm here, well, I can tell you I intend to change things for the better, to do the most good for the most people and do it all in honor of Jared Banks.",
        "Langston: How great was that?",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I don't understand. You all seem so offended.",
        "Bo: I need units at St. James Church now.",
        "Clint: Bo, I'm going to the funeral home.",
        "Natalie: Do you think that Jared's really there?",
        "Mitch: What, are you accusing me of lying?",
        "Bo: Look, you're not going alone. You could walk right into a trap.",
        "John: See if we have any units in the area.",
        "Natalie: I'm going with you.",
        "Clint: No, you're not!",
        "Natalie: I want to see him.",
        "Clint: You will, I promise you that.",
        "Nora: Clint, just listen to Bo, really. Make sure it's safe.",
        "Mitch: Jessica, tell me, did you receive my letter?",
        "Brody: Don't talk to her.",
        "Mitch: Jessica?",
        "Brody: Don't even look at her.",
        "Mitch: You read it, didn't you? You know how much my beautiful daughter means to me.",
        "Clint: She is not your daughter!",
        "Nora: Clint.",

        "Kyle: I never should have let things go as far as they did.",
        "Nick: What, to the altar?",
        "Kyle: It was supposed to be symbolic, Nick. You can't tell me that you were really in love with me. We hadn't even dated that long.",
        "Nick: No, we hadn't.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, and when Dr. Lord said that the marriages were gonna be legal, I just realized I couldn't make that kind of commitment.",
        "Nick: You sound just like a straight guy.",
        "Kyle: Look, it wasn't cold feet. I didn't get scared. I just realized that there was a guy that I wanted to marry one day, and he was just standing a few feet away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: How could you possibly disappoint Kyle?",
        "Oliver: You know what, leave it to me to figure it out.",
        "Layla: He's been in love with you since college. I think he knows what he's getting.",
        "Oliver: That's just it.",
        "Layla: What do you mean?",
        "Oliver: What if it's not what he's expecting?",
        "Layla: You both are the same people you were in that frat house.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but all these years, I pretended to be straight. I dated women, only women.",
        "Layla: Mmm, I remember.",
        "Oliver: Okay, well, Kyle came out when he was in high school. He's used to guys who...",
        "Layla: Guys who what?",
        "Oliver: Guys who know what they're doing.",
        "Layla: You're worried about the sex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Ah, yes. Clint Buchanan, the cuckold. You were married to Victoria at the time of our assignation.",
        "Viki: Assignation? You raped me.",
        "Mitch: You wanted a child so badly, you were willing to take mine.",
        "Clint: Nobody took anything from you, Laurence.",
        "Mitch: Wasn't it nice of me, though, to allow you to raise my daughter?",
        "Bo: Now, take it easy. Take it easy.",
        "Clint: Jessica is my daughter and always will be!",
        "Nora: We need to go to the funeral home, Clint, okay? Come on. Clint. I don't want you to go by yourself.",
        "Clint: You stay here. I'm not gonna be by myself. He's sending backup.",
        "Nora: That's not what I meant.",
        "Clint: It's better if I go alone, all right? And Lord knows what I'll find there.",
        "Mitch: Lord knows what he'll find in his own backyard. Right, Nora?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Would you keep your voice down?",
        "Layla: I'm sorry. I just can't believe you're worried about the--",
        "Oliver: Well, I am, okay? It's all I can think about.",
        "Layla: That's good.",
        "Oliver: How is that good?",
        "Layla: Most people like the anticipation. It makes it exciting.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry. This is not anticipation. This is fear.",
        "Layla: Well, if you're not ready...",
        "Oliver: No, I'm ready, believe me. I'm ready.",
        "Layla: So?",
        "Oliver: I just don't want to mess it up.",
        "Layla: Look, I don't know about Kyle, but our night together... I had a pretty good time.",
        "Oliver: Well, thank you, but I'm pretty sure it's different with a guy.",
        "Layla: Yeah, I realize that. But the feelings are the same, aren't they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So, how's that going, anyway?",
        "Kyle: With Oliver?",
        "Nick: No, the trade talks in Uzbekistan.",
        "Kyle: It's good. It's good. We spent Thanksgiving together, and tonight, we're, uh...",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Kyle: Have our first official date.",
        "Nick: Date? Who's taking who to the malt shop?",
        "Kyle: Go ahead and laugh, but we've never actually been out together.",
        "Nick: Not even in college?",
        "Kyle: Oliver out in public with another guy? Come on.",
        "Nick: I mean, you guys got back together a month ago.",
        "Kyle: Yeah.",
        "Nick: Making up for lost time. Got it.",
        "Kyle: No, we're just--I don't know. Just taking it slow, you know, trying to get to know each other again.",
        "Nick: You mean you haven't slept together yet? Are you serious?",
        "Kyle: I have to go.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry. I mean, I just thought that--'cause when you and I first started getting together--",
        "Kyle: It was different.",
        "Nick: Right. You weren't in love with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You were...",
        "Starr: Recording it?",
        "Markko: I got it all.",
        "Langston: Yep. You were amazing.",
        "Dorian: Oh! No, no, no, no. I'm not dressed. My hair and makeup aren't finished.",
        "Markko: No, but that's what made it real. Llanview's new mayor speaking from the heart before she's sworn in.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and Markko wants to record today's ceremony, and he's gonna edit it together with the same-sex wedding.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no, no, no. Echoes of David. You are not doing another reality show, are you?",
        "Markko: Believe me, I am done with those.",
        "Langston: No, it's a documentary, kind of like \"The Life and Times of Harvey Milk.\"",
        "Cole: Hopefully with a better ending.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: So, this would be about my campaign for justice.",
        "Starr: Yes, it would be your \"Road to City Hall.\"",
        "Dorian: Do you think you can have it ready in time for Sundance?",
        "Markko: Probably.",
        "Dorian: Probably?",
        "Markko: If I rush through the editing.",
        "Dorian: All right! Okay! Let me get a dress and fix myself up. It'll just take a second, unless, of course, you would like to video my toilette.",
        "Markko: Uh, I don't think so. Oh, but thanks for asking.",
        "Dorian: A bient\u00f4t.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why is he here? Why are you here?",
        "John: Don't. That isn't what you do.",
        "Natalie: Then why the hell is he here? He should be in jail right now. You should be rotting behind bars for the rest of your life!",
        "Mitch: Well, the good people of California disagree with you, darling. They've dropped the charges against me.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Roxy: No freakin' way!",
        "Viki: That's not possible.",
        "Natalie: They can't do that. They can't do that. No, he shot Jared right in front of me. He killed him right in front of me.",
        "John: I wish I could say that it isn't true. I just got off the phone with the Napa D.A.'s office. They verified it.",
        "Mitch: That's right, people. I'm free as the proverbial bird. We won't need letters anymore, kitten. Daddy's home.",
        "Cop: The men are posted, and the perimeter's clear.",
        "Bo: All right, make another sweep. Make sure that he doesn't have any of his stooges out there.",
        "Mitch: Gee, all this trouble for me, an innocent guy attending a funeral?",
        "Bo: You make up your own reality, Laurence. I'll find out how you convinced the state of California to buy into it.",
        "Mitch: Well, you go right ahead. It doesn't change the fact that I am a free, free, free man.",
        "Bo: Well, this will. Arrest him.",
        "Mitch: For what?",
        "John: For the murders of Wayne Landers and Pamela Stuart.",
        "Mitch: Except that Jared Banks is the one that killed them.",
        "Charlie: Shut your filthy mouth!",
        "Bo: Get him out of here!",
        "Mitch: I'm going. You don't have to manhandle me. I'll go peacefully. I'm a man of God, after all.",
        "Brody: Shut up and move.",
        "Mitch: Not before... I've said a proper hello to my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Mayor-elect Dorian Cramer Lord.",
        "Dorian: Thank you, dear. And I want to thank the city council for entrusting me with this office. And I pledge to work for the good of all of the citizens of Llanview.",
        "Amelia: Including those that believe gay marriage is an abomination?",
        "Dorian: Amelia Bennett.",
        "Amelia: You know I wouldn't miss your swearing-in.",
        "Dorian: Miss Bennett has worked by my side to fight for the equal rights of all.",
        "Amelia: You know the campaign's over. You're in office.",
        "Dorian: And that's what we wanted, isn't it?",
        "Amelia: Oh, yeah, but those promises you made might cost you politically. Are you sure you're ready to follow through?",
        "Dorian: I'm Dorian Lord, and I keep my promises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I'm gonna be late for work.",
        "Nick: Kyle. I didn't mean that the way it sounded.",
        "Kyle: What, that I only sleep with guys I don't care about?",
        "Nick: No. When we got together, I felt something that... I felt something that I just don't usually feel. So, when you dumped me, it hurt.",
        "Kyle: I don't know what to say, Nick.",
        "Nick: Don't say anything. Please, don't apologize.",
        "Kyle: I am sorry, though.",
        "Nick: I know. And I would like it if we could be friends.",
        "Kyle: You're serious?",
        "Nick: Look, you're with Oliver now, and I respect that. But just 'cause we're not seeing each other doesn't mean we can't see each other. Ha ha. Who knows? Maybe the 3 of us can have dinner sometime. What do you say? Friends?",
        "Kyle: Friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You leave my kid alone.",
        "Mitch: Are you still trying to keep me from him?",
        "Bo: Let's go, Laurence.",
        "Mitch: After all the time I've waited. Rex Balsom, the son I always wanted.",
        "Bo: Now, that's enough! Come on, get him out of here.",
        "Mitch: I'll be in touch. We have much work to do, you and I!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Oh, it's not what you think.",
        "Oliver: I wasn't thinking anything.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, Nick was just asking if we could all try to be friends.",
        "Nick: And Kyle being the great guy that he is said okay.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, Kyle is a pretty great guy.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, Nick was just telling me how lucky a guy I am.",
        "Nick: You are, both of you. And who knows. If Dr. Lord makes good on her promise, maybe you can make it legal.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I don't know if we're quite ready to pick out rings quite yet.",
        "Nick: Right, right. You haven't even slept together, I mean since college. I'm gonna go see if Amelia needs any help.",
        "Kyle: Have I told you how sexy you look in this uniform?",
        "Oliver: Um, I'm sorry. Did I just hear him right?",
        "Kyle: When he said how lucky a guy I am?",
        "Oliver: No, that you told your ex-boyfriend that we haven't done it yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I just wish Blair were here.",
        "Starr: What happened? All I heard was \"Jack\", \"school\", and \"public menace\", and my mom took off.",
        "City clerk: Excuse me, Madame Mayor, may we brief you on today's schedule?",
        "Dorian: Oh, absolutely. Right this way.",
        "City clerk: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So, how does it feel to be the future first lady of Llanview?",
        "Amelia: I'll let you know as soon as I know.",
        "Nick: What, you think Dorian's gonna go back on her promise to make gay marriage legal?",
        "Amelia: No, she swears she's committed to the cause.",
        "Nick: She better be. We're the ones who put her in office.",
        "Amelia: She knows. Dorian is good people. Don't worry, Nick. She's not gonna forget about us.",

        "Roxy: Rexy, you okay? Rex?",
        "Viki: I don't understand this. How could this happen?",
        "Natalie: He shot Jared.",
        "Charlie: In front of witnesses.",
        "John: I don't know. I'm gonna find out.",
        "Natalie: You should go. You should go find out what happened. I'll be fine.",

        "Natalie: Yeah. I'll be fine, just go, please. Dad.",
        "Clint: Jared's body was at the funeral home.",
        "John: Anyone see Laurence there?",
        "Clint: No, they don't know what the hell happened, but they're sending a hearse over for the casket, so... as soon as you're ready.",
        "Charlie: Why don't we go talk to the reverend?",
        "John: Excuse me.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "John: I'm gonna head on over to the station, okay?",
        "Marty: Yeah. I think I'll stay here. I have a feeling I might be needed.",

        "Marty: Okay.",
        "John: I'll see you later.",
