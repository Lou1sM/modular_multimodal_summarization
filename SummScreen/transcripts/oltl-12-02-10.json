        "After Inez declares to Clint that she will go through with seducing Bo and breaking up his marriage to Nora if Clint makes Eddie disappear, she wants to find out what happened. At her son's apartment, they all wonder why Eddie is not there. Meanwhile, Clint invites him over and pulls a gun on him, then shows him a briefcase with money and gives Eddie the gun telling him he can have the money \"under certain conditions\" although he does not reveal the conditions. Meanwhile, Nora goes to talk to Viki about how her marriage to Bo is on the rocks because of Inez. And Viki reveals that her marriage to Charlie is similarly on the rocks because of Echo. Dorian privately meets with Echo, makes nice to her and encourages her to go after Charlie, while she secretly knows that Echo and Clint both know that Charlie is not her son's father and Clint is. Starr wants to inform Marty that she apologizes for her father having her unknowingly signing a restraining order for Marty not to be able to see Hope and assures her she will get the order lifted. But Marty tells Starr that she blames her for what happened to Cole and reveals she knows that Starr fell out of love with her son and in love with James. And at that point, Star tells James that her father might be correct about Marty. Right then, Marty meets with John and is ready to give him his \"gift wrapped present\" that will reveal to him that Natalie is pregnant with another man's child. Kelly and Aubrey are both waiting for Joey talking about their \"respective\" men in their lives. And neither knows that they are both waiting for the same guy. And Kelly has no clue that Joey is with Aubrey and no longer interested in her."

        "Kelly: Hi. Heh.",
        "Rex: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Kelly: No. I'm just thinking.",
        "Rex: About Joey?",
        "Kelly: Hmm...",
        "Rex: What did he say when you told him you wanted to get back together?",
        "Kelly: I couldn't.",
        "Rex: Why not?",
        "Kelly: Because I was choking on an olive. It's a long story. Anyway, the point is, seeing him again made me even more sure. I am so definite that Joey Buchanan is the love of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I'm sorry I left before you woke up.",
        "Aubrey: That's all right, Joey. I needed my beauty sleep. I have to admit, I am nervous to meet your parents.",
        "Joey: Hey, don't be. I'm sure they're gonna be as crazy about you as I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Nora.",
        "Nora: Viki, I got to talk to you.",
        "Viki: Come in. What's the matter?",
        "Nora: That woman.",
        "Viki: What woman?",
        "Nora: Inez Salinger. She's trying to destroy my marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I'm sorry. Did I wake you?",
        "James: No, no. It's okay. I was awake.",
        "Inez: How are you? Oh.",
        "James: No. Don't.",
        "Inez: I can't tell you how sorry I am that your father hit you.",
        "James: Oh, it's fine. I mean, it's over with.",
        "Ford: What are you doing here?",
        "James: Oh, hey, Bobby.",
        "Ford: I'm sorry. It's just usually Dad gives James a hard time first thing in the morning.",
        "Inez: After everything that happened yesterday, I just wanted to come by and make sure you were both okay. Is Eddie here?",
        "James: I haven't seen him. He was gone when I got up.",
        "Ford: Really?",
        "James: Yeah.",
        "Ford: He's always here. Where would he have gone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So, Eddie, can I get you a drink?",
        "Eddie: Really? It's a little early, but why not?",
        "Clint: Ha ha! That's what I always say. In this house, we drink bourbon.",
        "Eddie: That's fine by me, but first, to be clear, like I told the limo driver --nice touch, by the way--but if you're anything like that brother of yours, I got no interest doing business with you.",
        "Clint: I'm not.",
        "Eddie: Oh.",
        "Clint: Cheers.",
        "Eddie: Thank you.",
        "Clint: Now then, to address your concerns, I think when you see what I have in here, I do believe that you will change your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go on and on about Inez.",
        "Viki: No. It's all right.",
        "Nora: No, I really actually wanted to ask you about Charlie. He must be so excited to find out Rex is his son.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Well, let's not talk about that.",
        "Nora: Why not? What happened?",
        "Viki: That woman.",
        "Nora: Who?",
        "Viki: Echo DiSavoy. She's trying to destroy my marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: A pitcher of mimosas, please, and plenty of champagne.",
        "Waiter: Absolutely, and can I bring you anything else with that?",
        "Dorian: No, thank you. Just keep those mimosas coming.",
        "Waiter: Certainly.",
        "Dorian: I'll get the truth out of that lush if I have to suffer through brunch with...Echo! Glad you could make it.",
        "Echo: Dorian, I do have to say how surprised I was by your invitation.",
        "Dorian: Really? Why?",
        "Echo: Well, you've made it very clear that you hate my guts. Let's see. What was it you called me? The slut of Llanview.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I regret having said that, and I wish we could start all over again. Echo, I'd like us to be friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Sorry I bothered you. When I heard Cole had been in a fight, I--",
        "John: It's okay. I made some calls, and Cole has been transferred to a safer wing.",
        "Marty: Thank you.",
        "John: You don't have to thank me. I just wish I could do something with the restraining order Manning slapped on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad...",
        "Todd: Hey, what's up?",
        "Starr: I saw Cole yesterday. He told me about the restraining order you got to keep Marty from seeing Hope.",
        "Todd: Yeah? So?",
        "Starr: You tricked me into signing it.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Echo, I owe you an apology.",
        "Echo: Well, now, that is something that we agree on. Do you know that I couldn't understand why you were being so horrendous to me after everything we've been through?",
        "Dorian: Oh, you mean like our nearly sending Clint to prison for your supposed murder?",
        "Echo: Yes. What I did to Clint and Viki was wrong, but it was eons ago.",
        "Dorian: Oh, indeed it was. Ha ha ha!",
        "Echo: And let's be honest. You're not exactly a pillar of virtue yourself.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha ha! True. We are alike in so many ways. Yeah. I, too, at one time tried to take Clint away from Viki--oh, yes--and more recently, I made the moves on Charlie. Chuckles. Ha ha ha!",
        "Echo: Oh, well...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Wait. Echo is after Charlie now?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: Didn't she learn her lesson back when she was trying to steal Clint?",
        "Viki: Apparently not. No. Anyway, let's talk about Inez. Why is she trying to destroy your marriage? I thought she was dating Clint.",
        "Nora: They broke up.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "Nora: Because she wants Bo.",
        "Viki: Oh, Nora...",
        "Nora: Listen. I didn't want to believe it, either, but then she comes around with all her little baked goods and all her little problems that only Bo can solve, and-- oh, my God, listen to me. I can't stand the way I sound when I'm talking about her. I can't stand the person she's turning me into, and, worst of all, I can't stand what she's doing to Bo and me.",
        "Viki: She's not really coming between you and Bo, is she?",
        "Nora: I don't know, but because of her-- she's opened up a whole Pandora's Box of troubles for us. Last night, Bo said something that was just unforgivable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: Your father was never much of an early riser.",
        "Ford: Well, these days, he can't get up early enough. He won't even let us in the bathroom until he's been in there 20 minutes smoking his damn cigar. Then he rides our asses till we leave, but he's always here.",
        "James: Yeah. Last night, he rubbed it all in our faces that he wasn't going anywhere.",
        "Ford: Hey, maybe he won't come back.",
        "Inez: Maybe.",
        "Eddie: Whoa, wait. What, are you gonna shoot me?",
        "Clint: Heh. Oh, relax. The gun goes with this.",
        "Eddie: Wow. That for me?",
        "Clint: If you agree to my terms, it will be.",
        "Eddie: Terms?",
        "Clint: I want you to do something for me.",
        "Eddie: Money and a gun. What could it be? What, do you want me to kill someone?",
        "Bo: Anybody home? Clint?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Did he give you any indication that he feels the same way about you?",
        "Kelly: Eh, he was friendly. He was warm, hot actually, especially when I was in his arms.",
        "Rex: In his arms?",
        "Kelly: Well, he had to give me the Heimlich, you know, the olive thing.",
        "Rex: Oh.",
        "Kelly: After I spit the thing out and I could breathe again, just when I was about to tell him how I felt, he got a call.",
        "Rex: You're kidding.",
        "Kelly: No. Then he left, but he did ask me to meet him at the Palace today.",
        "Rex: So? You going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I promise, Aubrey, my parents are going to love you.",
        "Aubrey: Have you had a chance to tell them about me yet?",
        "Joey: No. Look. I still want it to be a surprise.",
        "Aubrey: Are you sure that's a good idea, Joey? I mean, shouldn't you at least prepare them?",
        "Joey: I think they can handle meeting my beautiful girlfriend. They just want me to be happy. They're not judgmental or controlling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah. I took advantage of the fact that you were distracted by your boyfriend to get you to sign the restraining order. Sue me.",
        "Starr: It's not funny, Dad, and maybe I will sue you. Hope is my daughter. I decide who can and cannot see her. I'm gonna get that restraining order lifted.",
        "Todd: So Marty can send another lunatic after you? I'm telling you, Starr, that woman is dangerous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: No, John. Please. You've already done more than enough for me...",
        "John: Forget about it.",
        "Marty: But...",
        "John: What's this?",
        "Marty's voice: Time for John to get a very special gift. Something to show my gratitude.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Marty made a mistake. She thought that Hannah was getting better.",
        "Todd: At what, lying or kidnapping?",
        "Starr: Marty is not the only one that Hannah snowed. She convinced Cole, too.",
        "Todd: Yeah, like that's hard. Starr, listen to me. You were nearly buried alive because of Cole's mother, and you would've been killed if James hadn't saved you, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: Did something happen to make you think that your father might be leaving?",
        "James: Okay. Look. Last night, Bobby paid him back the 50 grand that I took from him.",
        "Inez: Where did you get $50,000?",
        "Ford: What does it matter? I thought he would take it and go, but all he said was that he wasn't ready to leave and that we talk about it in the morning.",
        "James: Well, it's morning now.",
        "Ford: Yeah. Right, and all of a sudden, we're Eddie-free? Doesn't make any sense.",
        "James: Well, you know him. What do you think is going on here?",
        "Inez's voice: I'll do it. I'll seduce Bo and try to ruin his marriage on one condition.",
        "Clint's voice: And that would be what?",
        "Inez's voice: You make Eddie disappear.",
        "Inez: I'm not sure. I just hope that something or someone has convinced your father to stay out of our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Clint? I'm out here yelling for you. You didn't hear me?",
        "Clint: Oh, Bo, I'm sorry. I just didn't feel like having company.",
        "Bo: Because of Inez?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Bo: She told me that you two broke up.",
        "Clint: No. We didn't break up. She dumped me. As they say, she just wasn't that into me, I guess.",
        "Bo: And you think she's into me. Did you mean it when you told Nora that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hang on. Hang on. What did Bo say that was so unforgivable?",
        "Nora: We were arguing...",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Nora: Over Inez, of course, and I was worried that something was starting to happen between the two.",
        "Viki: Oh, Nora, you don't really think that, do you?",
        "Nora: I don't want to believe it, but I started to because of Inez and the woman that she is. She's this classic damsel in distress, and she uses that to worm her way into Bo's life. It's not because I thought Bo was actually interested in her.",
        "Viki: Of course he isn't.",
        "Nora: Well, then the fight started escalating out of control.",
        "Joey: Aunt Nora.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God, Joey.",
        "Joey: Oh, it is so great to see you.",
        "Nora: So good to see you.",
        "Joey: Oh, I'm sorry I missed the wedding.",
        "Nora: Oh, you didn't stay home out of protest?",
        "Joey: What? No. No. I mean, I am sorry for my dad...",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well, we all are.",
        "Joey: But you and Uncle Bo belong together. Some couples are just meant to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Of course I'm gonna meet Joey at the Palace. He even hinted he had something important to tell me.",
        "Rex: So in a couple of hours, you and Joey will be a couple again.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. What time is it?",
        "Rex: Uh...",
        "Kelly: Ah, I got to go. I need to be at the Palace first so I can be calm and composed before Joey arrives.",
        "Rex: Are you sure you're composed now?",
        "Kelly: Now? No, but I will be. I have got to get it out this time with some subtlety and some grace. Did you need to ask me something? I'm sure you didn't come here to ask me about Joey.",
        "Rex: Actually, I came here looking for work. Now that Gigi and I are back together, I need to refocus on my career.",
        "Kelly: Okay. Well, wait here for Todd. I'm sure he'll have something for you to do. He always wants some dirt. How do I look?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, Marty never wanted us to get hurt, and now that Hannah is locked up for good, she's not going to let anything bad happen to us again.",
        "Todd: Till she decides she wants another psycho houseguest.",
        "Starr: She didn't know that Hannah was a psycho.",
        "Todd: Starr, she knew Hannah lied that I was the one who pushed her down the stairs, and she nearly sent me to prison just so she could steal your boyfriend, and she still asked them to cut her loose.",
        "Starr: I know. She didn't think that any of this would happen.",
        "Todd: She's either an idiot or out for revenge. Knowing Marty, I choose revenge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thanks, but you didn't need to do this.",
        "Marty: Hey, after everything you've done for Cole--",
        "John: Well, I care about the kid. It's the right thing to do.",
        "Marty: Yes, and I could see by the way you treat Cole you're gonna be a wonderful father.",
        "John: I hope so.",
        "Marty: Yes. Well, this baby is very lucky that you'll be raising him or her, and that's what this gift is all about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Todd: No. It doesn't take a shrink to figure out that on some level, Marty wanted Hannah to go after you.",
        "Starr: That is so paranoid, even for you.",
        "Todd: Can you think of a better way to get at me than through you and Hope?",
        "Starr: You do know that not everything is about you, Dad.",
        "Todd: Hmm, not this. Hannah was losing her grip. How could Marty have missed that?",
        "Starr: I know what you're trying to do.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm trying to keep Marty from hurting my family.",
        "Starr: You are trying to wipe any trace of Cole out of my life.",
        "Todd: No. I'm trying to keep my family safe.",
        "Starr: With Cole in prison, Hope is all Marty has left, and I'm not going to let you do this to her. I'm gonna undo that restraining order.",
        "Todd: You'll regret it. Mark my words.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: If you insist. I just hope you didn't go overboard.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, no. It's not like it was expensive of anything, but it did take some doing to get my hands on it. It's definitely something you need.",
        "John: I got to admit, now you got me curious. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: It's true. I do like Chuckles.",
        "Dorian: Who could blame you? He's a wonderful man. Oh, pity that he's so happily married, n'est-ce pas?",
        "Echo: Yes. That is a pity.",
        "Dorian: I couldn't get him to budge. You obviously have the gift.",
        "Echo: Well, I don't know. He does love Viki.",
        "Dorian: And yet he convinced her to allow you to move in with them, I mean, even with your history?",
        "Echo: Yeah. Well, you know Viki. Her compassion knows no bounds.",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes. She's a pillar of virtue. Oh, yes. I'll drink to that. You know what? There has got to be something going on between you and Chuckles, or else why would he have convinced her to allow that to happen?",
        "Echo: Yes. He has been rather chivalrous.",
        "Dorian: Aha. So you did move into Llanfair in order to be closer to him.",
        "Echo: No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. I moved into Llanfair because I'm financially challenged.",
        "Dorian: Oh. I didn't know that. Well, perhaps you will allow me to help. Move in with the Cramer women, into La Boulaie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I'm sure you two ladies have lots to talk about, so I'll just leave you to it, and I will see you later for lunch.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, I wouldn't miss it.",
        "Joey: Ah, and bring Charlie.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Joey: I have something huge to tell you.",
        "Viki: Yeah. The suspense is kind of killing me here.",
        "Nora: Oh, hey, Joey, really, you know, your mother's a heart patient here.",
        "Joey: Just be there. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Aubrey: Hey, listen. I'm waiting for Joey right now. I can't really talk. He's gonna be here any min--",
        "Kelly: Aubrey?",
        "Aubrey: Oh, my God. I got to go. It's my friend from the plane. I will call you later. Kelly, I can't believe I ran into you again.",
        "Kelly: What are you doing here?",
        "Aubrey: Meeting my boyfriend's parents for the first time. If you want to see me die of anxiety, stick around.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: It's true. Inez broke things off because of you. I didn't pick up on things when you and Nora were falling in love behind my back, but with you and Inez, I saw that a mile away.",
        "Bo: There is no Inez and me. I'm happily married. I love Nora. I spent most of last night trying to convince her of that.",
        "Clint: Did it work?",
        "Bo: We had an argument. Then I said something really stupid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, it's so wonderful that Joey is home.",
        "Viki: Yes. It really is. I don't think I even realized how much I missed him. Let's talk about you and Bo. What did he say that was so terrible?",
        "Nora: Oh, Viki, I was trying to convince Bo that Inez is manipulating him, you know, that her behavior, she's using it just to get close to him because she wants him and because of that, she's a threat to our marriage...",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Nora: And you know what he said to me? \"I'm not the one who cheats.\"",
        "Viki: Oh, dear.",
        "Nora: I can't believe it. After all this time of telling me that he's forgiven me, he throws the affair with Sam in my face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Bo, I'm sorry that Inez is causing trouble for you and Nora.",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "Clint: How serious can it be? You two can get past Inez's crush, can't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I feel terrible about what happened to your brother.",
        "Ford: Don't worry about it. It's not your fault. You weren't there, as usual.",
        "Inez: I know that you feel bad, too, and that's why you went to Clint for the 50,000.",
        "Ford: He told you?",
        "Inez: Yes.",
        "Ford: I had to do something. I promised James that I wasn't gonna let dad hurt him again, and Clint was the only one I knew to ask.",
        "Inez: I understand.",
        "Ford: No. I don't know if you do, okay? I know you're seeing him, but I don't trust him, and I don't think you should, either.",
        "Inez: Okay. It doesn't matter now because we broke up.",
        "Ford: You did? Why?",
        "Inez: Because Clint is just as bad as your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hey, Rex. So Kelly told me you're looking for work. That's great. Today is your lucky day. The P.I. I was using went AWOL, so I'm hoping you'll do a better job than that moron.",
        "Rex: What do you want me to do?",

        "Starr: Hi, John. Marty, I am so glad that you're here. I was gonna call you.",
        "Marty: Hello, Starr.",
        "Starr: I saw Cole at Statesville last night, and he told me about the restraining order.",
        "John: Hey, look. Why don't I give you two a chance to--",
        "Marty: No, no because you were gonna open the present.",
        "John: I will. I will. I got to make a couple calls, anyway.",
        "Starr: Marty, I really hope you know that this was all my dad. He tricked me into signing that restraining order.",
        "Marty: I see.",
        "Starr: Yeah. He's blaming this whole thing on you and--",
        "Marty: And I'll take responsibility for my part in what happened as long as you do the same.",

        "Ford: What do you mean, Clint is as bad as Dad?",
        "Inez: I just want you to be careful around him. That's all.",
        "Ford: I already know I need to be careful around him.",
        "Inez: What do you mean? He got you your job back. He gave you the money to pay off your father.",
        "Ford: I have my reasons.",
        "Inez: Well, whatever those reasons are, just stay away from him.",
        "Ford: Believe it or not, I hope you do, too. No matter how I feel about you, I still don't want you on the wrong side of that S.O.B.",
        "Inez: Thank you.",
        "Ford: So why did you break up? Did he do something to you? Did he hurt you?",
        "Inez: No, no, no. It's nothing like that. Bobby, I don't know what to do.",

        "Bo: Clint, I'm sorry about all of this, but I hope you don't blame me for what happened between you and Inez.",
        "Clint: No. Of course I don't blame you. I'll get over Inez. I've taken a lot worse.",
        "Bo: Let me know if there's anything I can do.",
        "Clint: Yes. Yes. I will, and I appreciate it. You can come out now.",
        "Eddie: So your brother and his wife having some marital problems.",

        "Joey: Never better. You know, I actually just saw Nora over at my mom's.",
        "Bo: How did she seem to you?",
        "Joey: Actually, she seemed kind of upset.",
        "Bo: All right. Look. I'd like to stick around, catch up with you, but I--",
        "Joey: You need to go. Don't worry about it.",
        "Bo: Hey, it's good to see you back.",

        "Nora: But he did.",
        "Viki: I really thought he got past that.",
        "Nora: So did I, but at the first sign of trouble, he went right back there.",
        "Viki: You know, it was in the heat of the moment, and he was angry, and I'm quite sure he's sorry. Have you talked to him?",
        "Nora: Uh-uh. No. I didn't go home last night. I slept in my office.",
        "Viki: Nora. Has he tried to call you?",
        "Nora: Yes. I'm not taking his calls.",
        "Viki: Oh...",
        "Nora: I don't know what to say. I can't forgive him if he can't forgive me.",

        "Clint: No, no. I'm just conducting a little business.",
        "Joey: Well, I hope you're not too busy for lunch at the Palace. There's something important, really important, I'd like to talk to you and Mom about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Well, how about you? Did you get back together with your ex?",
        "Kelly: Not yet, but I did see him late last night.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, late is good. Did you tell him how you feel?",
        "Kelly: I didn't get a chance. I choked on an olive.",
        "Aubrey: You what?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. It's a long story, but when he walks through that door, I'm gonna tell him. That is, if he doesn't beat me to it.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, you think--",
        "Kelly: He hinted that he had some news for me.",

        "Echo: I don't know what to say, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Say yes. Come on. Who'd be more fun to live with, virtuous Viki or moi?",
        "Echo: Well, it's very generous of you to offer me shelter, but living at Llanfair means that I am just steps away from my son and my grandson.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Of course. Steps, inches away from Chuckles. Oh, he is an extraordinary man, isn't he?",
        "Echo: He's good, and he's kind.",
        "Dorian: And he's so happy now, thanks to you.",
        "Echo: Right.",

        "Nora: I don't know, Viki. I think it just might make things worse, you know?",
        "Viki: Well, look on the bright side. At least Inez isn't living with you.",
        "Nora: What? No. Echo is...",
        "Viki: Living here. Yes. Charlie asked her to move in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: A toast.",
        "Echo: Another one?",
        "Dorian: Yes, to you, Echo, for giving Charlie the greatest gift a woman can give a man--a child, especially since that child could easily have been Clint's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You want dirt on Marty Saybrooke? Why?",
        "Todd: Well, so I can convince my hopelessly naive daughter that she's a danger and a threat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Sorry, but what do I have to take responsibility for?",
        "Marty: I think you know.",
        "Starr: What I know is that Hannah kidnapped Hope and me and held us at gunpoint and told me to bury James alive.",
        "Marty: Yes. Yes. She did.",
        "Starr: So I don't understand why you're pointing the finger at me. I'm not the one--",
        "Marty: Cole would never have turned to Hannah in the first place if you hadn't been running around with James.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: What do you mean, you don't know what to do? What happened with you and Clint? What's wrong?",
        "James: Okay, you guys. Who wants breakfast? I'm thinking the special down at Buenos Dias Cafe. Anybody in?",
        "Ford: Just a second. What were you about to tell me?",
        "Inez: You know what? It's really not that important, and I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on breakfast, but thank you.",
        "Ford: Me, too. Rain check.",
        "James: Okay. I guess more for me, then. Hey, give me a ring if Dad calls.",
        "Ford: I will. Are you sure you don't want to tell me what's going on between you and Clint?",
        "Inez: Let's just say that like you, I'm doing what I need to do for James.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Joey, I would be delighted to join you for lunch. We got a lot to catch up on.",
        "Joey: Great. I have so much to tell you and Mom.",
        "Clint: I can't wait.",
        "Joey: See you over there, and if you want, you can bring that new girlfriend of yours.",
        "Clint: Ah, well, Joey, that didn't quite work out.",
        "Joey: Sorry to hear that. You've really had a hard time with women lately, haven't you, Dad?",
        "Clint: Don't worry about me. I'm fine. I'm even better than fine now that you're home. So I'll see you over there.",
        "Joey: Okay. I get it.",
        "Clint: Yeah. All right. Back to business. Mr. Ford, you get this money after you do what I need you to do.",
        "Eddie: And the gun?",
        "Clint: Oh, you can take this with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. Echo DiSavoy, the woman who tried stealing one husband and is in the process of trying to steal another, is living here in your house with you and Charlie.",
        "Viki: Yeah. That's about the size of it.",
        "Nora: How on earth did that happen?",
        "Viki: In layman's terms, \"Nora, she's broke,\" and, as Charlie keeps reminding me, she's the mother of his son, \"and we have all this room here, and she has nowhere to go.\"",
        "Nora: Okay. How is that your problem?",
        "Viki: That's what I said, but Charlie has asked me to have compassion for Echo, and if I'm at all resistant to that or even slightly suspicious of her motives for wanting to live under the same roof with us--",
        "Nora: Then you're the bad guy.",
        "Viki: Yes, yes. Now I am the jealous, petty, and insecure wife.",
        "Nora: Exactly. I know exactly how you feel.",
        "Viki: Yes, and like you, she has turned me into an angry and sarcastic harpy, and I hate that. I hate myself for it because that's not who I am.",
        "Nora: I know. Me, neither, and it's just miserable being like that, isn't it, but you can't stop because you know without a doubt...",
        "Nora and Viki: We're right.",
        "Nora: Oh, I hate what Inez is doing to me and Bo.",
        "Viki: And even if Echo isn't trying to get her claws into Charlie, the point is, she's making trouble for us.",
        "Nora: Isn't it amazing?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Nora: So how do you plan to fight back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Echo, what's wrong? Why aren't you drinking to yourself?",
        "Echo: It's just, I just hate the thought of hurting Charlie. Someday--",
        "Dorian: How could you hurt Charlie? You've given him a son. That poor man, when Jared was killed, he was broken. He was shattered.",
        "Echo: I can imagine.",
        "Dorian: You could've kept your secret forever. Brava, I say. It took a great deal of courage for you to tell the truth.",
        "Echo: Yes. Courage.",
        "Dorian: Clint must've been devastated when he found out that he--",
        "Echo: Devastated? Devastated? Ha ha ha! Clint was ascetic-- static--ecstatic.",
        "Dorian: Oh, was he?",
        "Echo: That S.O.B. would have done anything in his power to make sure Rex wasn't his son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So, Mr. Ford, do we have an understanding?",
        "Eddie: Oh, yes, Mr. Buchanan. I believe we do.",
        "Clint: It's never easy, is it, Pa? Asa, I'm doing everything I have to do to protect this family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Let's go. Make up your mind.",
        "Rex: Okay. I will dig for dirt on Dr. Saybrooke for you.",
        "Todd: That's great. That's what I like to hear.",
        "Rex: You do realize, you have to pay me, even if I don't find anything.",
        "Todd: Find something, then. Oh, hey, while you're at it, there's someone else I want you to keep your eye on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Marty, I was not running around with James.",
        "Marty: Then what exactly would you like to call it?",
        "Starr: James and I are friends, and as soon as I knew that it bothered Cole, I broke off the friendship. I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Marty: Except fall in love with James.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Marty: You didn't think I knew that, did you? Cole told me. You fell out of love with him and fell in love with James.",
        "Starr: I never--",
        "Marty: That is what started his downward spiral. Don't you understand? He didn't care what happened. He shot Eli Clarke all because of you.",
        "James: Starr--",
        "Marty: Ah! Speak of the devil.",
        "James: Wait. Whoa. Is everything okay over here?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I'm done here.",
        "James: Hey, what was that all about?",
        "Starr: Nothing. I don't even know.",
        "James: Hey, stop. You can talk to me, Starr. Tell me. What's going on?",
        "Starr: She's blaming everything that happened with Cole on me.",
        "James: Wait, wait I don't get it. What is she saying?",
        "Starr: She's saying that everything that happened with Cole was because I fell out of love with Cole and in love with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Well, I feel like a dope for asking this--I realize we hardly know each other--but, Kelly, you're just so put together.",
        "Kelly: Oh, you think so? Put the hair down just to spice things up a bit.",
        "Aubrey: You look gorgeous.",
        "Kelly: Thanks.",
        "Aubrey: Do you think-- is there any way you could help me pick out something to wear?",
        "Kelly: Are you kidding? I'd love to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Echo, what do you mean, Clint would have done anything to make sure that Rex was not his son?",
        "Echo: You know what? Charlie is so happy. It's so wonderful to see he and Rex and Shane all together. It's so very wonderful.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. Yes, but what could Clint have done to ensure that Rex wouldn't be his son? And you were the one who announced that Charlie was Rex's father.",
        "Echo: Yes. Yes. I was, but I didn't want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't know how I'm gonna handle Echo yet.",
        "Nora: Don't let her manipulate you and Charlie into having the same kind of fight that Bo and I had.",
        "Viki: Nora, you have to talk to him.",
        "Nora: I have to go. You have to talk to Charlie about lunch with Joey.",
        "Viki: Good-bye. That will be bliss--lunch with Charlie and my Joey and no Echo DiSavoy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: The look on Clint's face when Viki demanded there be a DNA test--",
        "Dorian: Yes. I know. I saw that. He looked like he wanted to commit murder.",
        "Echo: That's the one. Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but why? Why would Clint be so angry, oh, unless it's possible that Charlie isn't Rex's father and Clint is, hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: What did you do to Eddie?",
        "Clint: What you wanted me to do.",
        "Inez: What does that mean?",
        "Clint: You wanted me to make sure that Eddie never bothers your sons again. I am making that happen. Now don't you worry. James is safe now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: So Cole's mom thinks you're in--",
        "Starr: No. You know what? She's not even thinking right now. She's being completely irrational. My dad warned me about this. He told me to stay away from her, but I just thought he was being my dad, but now I think he might have been right.",
        "James: All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: How'd it go with Starr?",
        "Marty: Not great.",
        "John: Well, you got to give it time. She'll get the restraining order lifted. There's no way she's gonna keep you from seeing your grandchild.",
        "Marty: I hope not. I'm just glad you're here to talk me down, which is one more reason why you should see what I got for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So we got a new pervert in town. The guy likes beating up his kid, and he messed with my daughter Dani.",

        "Todd: Eddie Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I got Eddie out of your life. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the bargain and sleep with Bo.",
        "Inez: I can't.",
        "Clint: Can't, Inez, or won't?",
        "Inez: It's impossible because no matter what I do or how hard I try, Bo is never gonna cheat on Nora.",
        "Clint: Nora is not gonna be a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All right, Nora. Time to work this out."
