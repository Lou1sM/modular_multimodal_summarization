        "Shane urges Neela to play the tape of Jack confessing to having Gigi Morasco killed. Although she really doesn't want to get Jack in trouble and he's expressed remorse, Shane gets her to play the recording to John McBain. John is very satisfied that he's finally gotten what he needs to make Jack pay and get justice for Rex and Shane, as he was not able to do before. But it seems Jack might be \"turning over a new leaf\", developing a conscience and Neela is caught in the middle and not happy as Shane and others are. Todd manages to make himself a hit with Blair, Starr, Sam and even Jack is cordial to him while he spends Christmas with them. A furious Viki reveals to Natalie that she caught Clint kissing Kim. Viki encourages her mother not to tolerate that although Jessica listens to her dad as he tells her he's made his decision to choose her mother over Kim. Viki and Clint finally resolve their misunderstanding and end up kissing and reconciling. In Paris, TX, Rex and Gigi/Stacy get to see the accurate video of what happened when Gigi died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the basement. And we learn, for the first time that Stacy came out of nowhere to finish what Jack and his friends started. She intended to let Gigi die in the basement and take her wedding dress to marry Rex in her sister's place. And Rex learns, for the first time, that the Gigi look alike is in fact the real Gigi and it was Stacy who died and looked just like Gigi and so everybody has been mistakenly believing that she was Gigi. Knowing that the love of his life is alive and well, Rex is finally complete."

        "Danielle: Jack! Have you seen this?",
        "Jack: Yeah, Scarface showed it to me.",
        "Todd: It was Jack. Jack set the fire.",
        "Todd: Hey, Tracy?",
        "Tracy: Yes, Mr. Manning?",
        "Todd: Well, what we were talking about before -- about how Jack sent everyone home early that afternoon?",
        "Tracy: Yes?",
        "Todd: That never happened.",
        "Jack: Scarface came over to see my mom, showed me the early edition.",
        "Danielle: So he did this?",
        "Jack: Scarface needs a fall guy so the police won't go after him. He killed dad. We both know it. But if he sets up Tom\u00e1s, he's in the clear.",
        "Neela: What did you just say?",
        "Shane: Jack Manning's a murderer. He killed my mom.",
        "Neela: [Sighs] You're joking, right? Because that's not possible. Why would you say that?",
        "Shane: Because it's true.",
        "Stacy: You're trying to become the man you want to be.",
        "Cutter: I don't know if that's in the cards, Stace.",
        "Stacy: Are you kidding me? You're halfway there.",
        "Cutter: Well, if I do end up going the distance, it'll be because of you.",
        "Aubrey: Rex, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to kiss you.",
        "Rex: No, that's okay.",
        "Aubrey: No, it's not. We're just friends. I'm only here to support you. I have no business kissing you. I can't believe I just did that.",
        "Rex: So, why did you?",
        "Stacy: Hmm.",
        "Cutter: You okay?",
        "Stacy: I don't know.",
        "Cutter: You thinking about Rex?",
        "Stacy: No, I wasn't thinking about Rex.",
        "Neela: Wait. So your mom, it's true? She died?",
        "Shane: Yeah, but she didn't just die. She was murdered. That's the one thing that me and Jack have in common -- a murdered parent. I didn't kill his dad, but Jack killed my mom.",
        "Neela: [Sighs]",
        "Shaun: Victor might not be on this earth anymore, so he gets out of diaper duty.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles]",
        "Shaun: And you know that he's gonna be watching every move that you make. To think he'd leave things up to you...",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, you're right. He probably wouldn't do that. [Laughs]",
        "Shaun: And every time you look at that child, you're gonna see their daddy looking right back at you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm very lucky to have this baby coming. It's a gift.",
        "Shaun: I know that you're going through a hard time right now, especially with the cops looking for your brother.",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you mean?",
        "Shaun: The cops think Tom\u00e1s shot Victor.",
        "Blair: I am so sorry. I was not aiming at you, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: You haven't heard from Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Blair: No. Why?",
        "Starr: The cops are looking for him.",
        "Blair: How do you know? Oh, no! Todd, you did not do that!",
        "Starr: Why didn't you tell me that Tom\u00e1s was a suspect?",
        "Danielle: This has to be why they were so crazy on Thanksgiving. It wasn't just that uncle Tom\u00e1s had missed dinner. Maybe the cops were after him.",
        "Jack: I got to admit it looks bad. They found the murder weapon in his room with his fingerprints all over it.",
        "Danielle: What are you saying? You think he did it? Jack, you've been saying this whole time that you think it's Todd. Are you changing your mind?",
        "Neela: Shane, I'm really sorry to hear about your mom. But what you're saying about Jack Manning, it can't be true. If he's a murderer, he would be in prison. But he's here -- in school. I just saw him in the hallway.",
        "Shane: Yeah, because the guy who Jack thought was his dad fixed it for him.",
        "Neela: [Sighs] What are you -- what are you talking about? You can't just make a murder go away.",
        "Shane: [Chuckling] Yeah, you can -- if you're rich. Jack had this friend named brad. He totally kissed up to him. Anyway, brad's dad lost his job a while back. So Victor Lord, the guy who Jack thought was his dad, paid him so that brad would confess.",
        "Neela: I don't believe it.",
        "Shane: It's online. You can look it up. Brad's in jail and Jack's not.",
        "Neela: So, brad's father let his son go to jail for money?",
        "Shane: Yeah, a lot of money.",
        "Todd: Jack didn't call you.",
        "Tracy: But he did.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Tracy: I remember it specifically. He said you wanted to give everyone the afternoon off, and that's why no one was there when the fire broke out. I mean, I was just about to tell lieutenant McBain.",
        "Todd: He never made that call. He was nowhere near the sun that afternoon, and you are not going to tell John McBain any of that.",
        "Tracy: And why would I do that, Mr. Manning?",
        "Todd: Because I -- didn't I -- didn't I see an e-mail that you wrote about how you were interested in filling the recently vacated position of fashion editor of the sun?",
        "Tracy: Someday sure, but --",
        "Todd: Yeah? I'm glad I got that right. Um, congratulations. You're the new sun style editor. I don't know what that is, but it's a big job, comes with a big raise and all the interns you can eat.",
        "Tracy: [Chuckles] I'm flattered, sir, but --",
        "Todd: Look, no one got hurt. We've already repaired all the damage. Why are we still talking about this fire?",
        "Tracy: You're asking me to lie to the police.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "John: Hi, Tracy. Manning, what are you doing here?",
        "Todd: I heard you were gonna interview my assistant about the fire at the sun. I can't wait to hear what she has to say.",
        "Todd: I own the sun.",
        "John: Hm.",
        "Todd: Not that one. If somebody's trying to burn down my newspaper, don't you think I have a right to know?",
        "John: Fair enough. Tracy... you want to come on in and have a seat?",
        "Todd: So, uh, where are we at? I heard it was Brody Lovett.",
        "John: Brody? No, he's not a suspect.",
        "Todd: You sure?",
        "John: Yeah, I'm sure. But, Tracy, you were there that day, weren't you? Yeah? Did you see anything out of the ordinary?",
        "Neela: But why would Jack's father want to keep him out of jail? If he's a murderer, wouldn't he want him punished?",
        "Shane: Their family doesn't care about what's right or wrong. They don't care about anything except for themselves.",
        "Neela: We s-shouldn't be talking like this. People could hear us.",
        "Shane: Trust me. Everybody already knows about Jack and his two dads.",
        "Neela: Well, I don't. And I don't want to hear any more. Jack's been really nice to me, and... I have to get ready for class.",
        "Shane: Yeah, whatever. Just watch out, okay? 'Cause being friends with Jack Manning, that's just asking for trouble. The guy's bad news.",
        "Jack: You think I'd burn down my own family's newspaper? No way.",
        "Neela: When I said my parents would turn me into a baby factory, you were like, \"I know a lie when I hear it, because I've been known to tell a few.\" Well, so have I.",
        "Jack: Fine! You win! I did it! I set the fire!",
        "Jack: Scarface is probably just going after your uncle so he can get the police to stop going after him. But if Tom\u00e1s is actually guilty... [Sighs] I don't know.",
        "Blair: All we knew was Tom\u00e1s was missing. I discussed it with T\u00e9a. We felt that we didn't want to tell you guys, we wanted to protect the children. Besides, you know, it was Thanksgiving.",
        "Starr: It was Thanksgiving days ago.",
        "Blair: Well, we didn't know anything. We were just trying to protect you.",
        "Starr: From what? Do you think that this is true?! You think that Tom\u00e1s killed uncle Victor?!",
        "Jack: You got to admit some of this stuff in this article's pretty convincing.",
        "T\u00e9a: I've read the article. And, yes, Tom\u00e1s is missing. And they did find the murder weapon in his room. And, yes, his fingerprints were on the gun.",
        "Blair: But I refuse to believe that Tom\u00e1s killed Victor, and it's a lot more complicated than your dad made it out in this article.",
        "Starr: What do you mean?",
        "Blair: Well, he just left out...a lot.",
        "Starr: Like what?",
        "Blair: Like the murder weapon belonged to Dorian.",
        "Starr: Then how did Tom\u00e1s get it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Nobody knows how Tom\u00e1s got his hands on the murder weapon. There are just way too many unanswered questions.",
        "Blair: Your dad stole the gun out of Dorian's safe. He admitted that.",
        "Starr: He gave the gun to that homeless man.",
        "Blair: Louie, who has now conveniently disappeared.",
        "Starr: But dad said that Louie had the gun the whole time. He didn't?",
        "Blair: Well, who knows? And until we find Tom\u00e1s, nobody's gonna know.",
        "Starr: Do you have any idea where he could be?",
        "T\u00e9a: I asked Tom\u00e1s to see what he could find out. The police weren't having any luck, and the case was getting cold. Tom\u00e1s was making some headway. He'd gotten a lead. I was there. He got a phone call. He left to pursue that lead, and that is the last time I saw him.",
        "Shaun: He'll be back.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, he will. And he'll be cleared. He has an alibi.",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s was with his friend Calmar the night that Victor was murdered, so he has an alibi. Okay, wait a minute. I know that look. What is going on in that brain of yours?!",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Shaun: Let's just hope that alibi pans out.",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you mean? Look, I know you have doubts about my brother, but tell me exactly what you're thinking.",
        "Starr: Mom, I don't want to upset you.",
        "Blair: Okay, wait, wait. Yeah, just say it, okay? Say it. What?",
        "Starr: Tom\u00e1s has a tendency to lie. He lied about his first alibi when he was first questioned, remember? How do you know he's not lying now?",
        "Danielle: Are you saying that you think our dad, Todd, that he's been telling the truth all along?",
        "Jack: No -- no way! Scarface is a liar. He's got no right to take dad's paper.",
        "Danielle: Then what are you saying?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Shane: You don't want to listen to me, it's your funeral. Didn't you both hear the announcement?",
        "Shane: What announcement? Mr. Weymouth had a family emergency, so class was canceled today. But he did leave an assignment for you in the library that's online.",
        "Shane: [Sighs] Great.",
        "Neela: Shane.",
        "Shane: Yeah?",
        "Neela: I'm sorry, just... if you don't mind, could you tell me how your mother died?",
        "Stacy: You're right. I should have been thinking about Rex.",
        "Cutter: Uh, that's not what I meant.",
        "Stacy: But it's true. I was so obsessed with Rex Balsom that I cut my face to look like his dead fianc\u00e9e, my sister, and except no matter how hard I try, I have no idea how I could do that.",
        "Cutter: Listen, we're down here so that dr. Fascinella can put you back the way you were. I promise you. You're gonna look in that mirror once he's done, and it'll all come back to you.",
        "Stacy: What if it doesn't?",
        "Cutter: It will.",
        "Stacy: [Sighs] I had no right to kiss you, Cutter. I... I don't even know who I am. I shouldn't be dragging you into my nightmare.",
        "Cutter: There's no place I'd rather be.",
        "Aubrey: I am so sorry, Rex. I did not mean to kiss you. It was just an impulse, like... Tourette's.",
        "Rex: [Sighs] Tourette's?",
        "Aubrey: Okay, you're right. I wanted to kiss you, and I did. And I shouldn't have. You're still in love with Gigi. You're grieving, and I totally respect that. I do, so I apologize. I do-- it was just...an inappropriate time and way premature and selfish. And I just -- it won't happen again. I'm sorry, so can we just forget about it and do what we were planning on doing, which is going to dr. Fascinella's and finding out who this woman is that Cutter's passing off as Gigi?",
        "Rex: Can we finish this conversation, huh?",
        "Aubrey: Um, do we have to?",
        "Rex: I think so, yeah. I am still grieving. And I will always love Gigi. But you don't have to apologize, okay? All these...things that you're feeling... I'm feeling it, too.",
        "Rex: Look, you are a beautiful woman, and we have had a great time -- like on Halloween. Uh, I forgot what that was like to actually have a good time. You've done so much for me, organizing that party, coming down here to brazil, and you're so great with my kid. I mean, what's not to like?",
        "Aubrey: Timing.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I'm just not ready to be with anyone. But if I were...",
        "Aubrey: [Chuckles]",
        "Rex: Look, what do you say we put these uniforms on and find out what Cutter and his mystery woman are up to, huh?",
        "Cutter: I didn't expect that kiss, either. But I don't regret it. You've been there for me since the very beginning. You've even stopped me from strangling my mother to death.",
        "Stacy: [Chuckles] So, it was a thank-you kiss.",
        "Cutter: No, it was a first kiss... I hope. Stacy, I like you. I-I haven't had feelings for another woman like this since Aubrey. I mean, you have this effect on me. I-I-it's good. You make me want to do the right thing, which, believe me, is rare.",
        "Stacy: No, it's not.",
        "Cutter: It is. I just backed off from a get-rich-quick scheme for the first time, probably. It was because of you -- 'cause I have feelings for you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Cutter: Yeah. Okay, all right. We'll be...right down there. Fascinella's back. You ready to see him?",
        "Stacy: The sooner the better. I need to go back to being Stacy so I can...try to make all this right. And who knows? With a little luck, maybe we can both change, Cutter.",
        "Cutter: Just be Stacy. That's all I want.",
        "Shane: What's the point? You're not gonna believe me anyway. Jack's like your new best friend now.",
        "Neela: I never said that. Shane, I'm new here. [Sighs] I don't know much about anyone. But I want to know the truth. So, please, could you tell me what happened to your mom?",
        "John: Tracy?",
        "Tracy: Sorry, I was just... what exactly do you mean by \"out of the ordinary\"? I work at a newspaper. Every day is different.",
        "John: Lucky for you. Yeah, no, I don't care about the newspaper stuff. I was just wondering, you know, if, you know, someone new showed up or you had an e-mail or a correspondence, something like that -- anything that maybe seemed strange to you.",
        "Tracy: No, not really.",
        "John: Uh, not really? Why? What happened?",
        "Tracy: Just Mr. Manning.",
        "John: Oh, what about him?",
        "Tracy: He gave us all the afternoon off.",
        "John: He let you all go home early?",
        "Tracy: Yes. He said that we'd done a great job with the paper and to have a nice evening.",
        "John: Well, what a nice guy.",
        "Todd: Well, I try.",
        "John: Well, Tracy, you know, thank you for coming down. Um, maybe if you go home tonight and you think about what you've told me and you want to change anything or maybe add something, you know where to reach me, okay?",
        "John: Hmm, so, let me see. You sent everybody home right before the fire started?",
        "Todd: John... are you suggesting that I set my own newspaper on fire?",
        "John: I've read it. Did you?",
        "Jack: I'm probably giving Scarface too much credit.",
        "Danielle: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: There is no way he figured out dad's murder all on his own. Besides, how'd the gun get from Scarface to Tom\u00e1s? The guy's been a spy half his life. There's no way he'd keep the murder weapon. Your uncle's probably totally innocent. Right?",
        "Danielle: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Well, he's got an alibi.",
        "Danielle: Yeah. But there's something weird about it.",
        "Blair: There was nothing wrong with Tom\u00e1s' alibi.",
        "Starr: Tom\u00e1s told the cops the reason he stood up Baz was because he had a flat tire.",
        "Blair: Yeah, but, you know, Baz couldn't wait to tell the cops that he was suspicious of his father. He never had a relationship with his father.",
        "Starr: It was still a lie! Tom\u00e1s never had a flat tire!",
        "Blair: Maybe not, but he had a really good reason for telling that story.",
        "Starr: Oh, okay. So that makes it okay to lie to the cops?",
        "Blair: It was a special circumstance, okay? Tom\u00e1s was meeting Calmar. They couldn't get it out that they were, you know -- let it out that they were meeting because Tom\u00e1s and Calmar --",
        "Starr: Are spies! Or agents, or whatever they are! And the reason they were getting together in the first place was to figure out a way to get rid of Victor!",
        "Todd: Let me save you some trouble. I did not set my newspaper on fire. You know, my recently departed, dear twin brother, Victor -- turns out he quadrupled my holdings, to his credit. The paper's now worth quite a bit of money.",
        "John: Oh. May I? Thanks. So, uh... why send everyone home early?",
        "Todd: Well, he was kind of a slave driver. You know, everybody was working, like, 16-hour days, seven days a week. [Chuckles] He really was my evil twin.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Todd: Oh, mmm. I really do want people to like me. So I sent them home early so that I could, uh, buy their affection. I know it's a cheap shot, but I just want someone to love me. Is that so wrong?",
        "John: No. I suppose what you're saying is true.",
        "Todd: Why are we wasting our time talking about this fire? Shouldn't you be off somewhere trying to find Tom\u00e1s Delgado?",
        "John: Oh, we'll find him.",
        "Shaun: Victor and I, we were tight. He'd get up in my face sometimes, but, hell... I could straighten him out with one hand, and he knew it.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles] He loved you.",
        "Shaun: He trusted me. And that's even better. And let's just say he wasn't too fond of your brother.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know.",
        "Shaun: [Sighs] So, I was keeping an eye on him, if you know what I'm saying. The first time Victor was shot... and, T\u00e9a, your brother just kept popping up at the hospital.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, that's because he was looking for a blood sample to prove who Victor really was.",
        "Shaun: If you say so.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, he was cleared by Victor himself of having shot him outside Rodi's. Tom\u00e1s saved his life that night and got wounded in the process. He's gonna be cleared again this time, I promise you.",
        "Danielle: Don't you remember? Tom\u00e1s told the cops he was meeting with his friend, Claude Calmar.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Danielle: Because they were trying to get rid of Victor. You know Tom\u00e1s had been trying to get my mom to divorce him ever since they met? He wanted Victor away from us.",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s and Calmar were not meeting so they could get rid of Victor -- at least not murder him. This was all about Irene, all right? They were afraid that she was gonna manipulate Victor. He was trying -- Tom\u00e1s was trying to protect us.",

        "Danielle: People do a lot of things you don't expect. Even murder.",
        "Shane: Jack and his friend brad, they were setting up this trap for me. They wanted me go to this vacant house, and they were gonna lock me in a basement. But my mom found out. And she went. And they ended up locking her in the basement instead.",
        "Neela: They locked your mother in the basement?",
        "Shane: Yeah. And there was this... generator in there, and... it was leaking carbon monoxide. It poisoned her.",
        "Neela: Oh, Shane. I'm so sorry.",
        "Shane: It was Jack's idea. He was the one who locked her in that basement. But he never had to own up to it. And brad took all the blame, and Jack just totally skated away while my family was just completely destroyed. My mom is dead. My dad's halfway around the world trying to... I don't even know. He's trying to get back what we've lost. But it's hopeless.",
