        "Todd gets up and shouts that Marty can't be allowed to testify on Spencer's behalf. The judge doesn't care about the connection between Marty and Todd. He only cares about the connection between Marty and Spencer, and he finds none. Marty is sworn in and takes the stand. John tells that he can't see how anyone would want to be with another person who is going to be ill for a long time. Michael tells his brother that they gave Natalie the ring in spite of him not having given it to her himself. John understands He needs a favor. He wants his brother to tell him how it really is. He needs to know more about the burns and see his face. Spencer doesn't like that his lawyer is trying to make him sound crazy. He shouts that he isn't a murderer, or crazy. Marty testifies that Spencer has had a break from reality and that it isn't uncommon considering the pressures that he has been under, even from before all this started. His pressure of having people's lives in his hands all the time and then the women in his life letting him down She feels that he is a perfect candidate for this. Evangeline tries to stop this line of questioning but the judge allows it. The judge calls a recess and puts Spencer on Suicide Watch. Blair finds that Todd is taking this very well. Later he goes to Mark Casey and tells him that he is very clever handling the case the way that he is, but that it isn't going to work. Mark tells Todd not to hold his breath. Todd stays alone in the courtroom and makes a call. When he is finished, Viki comes to see him. She heard that Marty was there and some things happened in court. She hopes that Todd won't be doing anything about this. \"No, there's nothing that I can do about this.\" Todd walks off leaving a confused Viki staring after him. Michael asks John is he still is planning on getting engaged to Natalie. He also tells how their mother gave the ring to Natalie because they thought that is what John would have wanted them to do. John understands. As for getting engaged, he can't understand how anyone would want to be stuck with someone who is sick like him. Jessica and Antonio take Bree and Nash out to eat. While they are at the table a man thinks that Jessica is Tess. Antonio tells that he is her husband and Jessica says that her name isn't Tess, and the man walks off. He thinks that she is just a wife who took a walk on the wild side. Marty goes to see Spencer. He chuckles. He tells that he has secrets that could blow up the lives.

        "Evangeline: Your honor, I object. Dr. Saybrooke was not on the witness list.",
        "Mark: That's true, your honor, but she is a qualified psychologist who was brought in to examine Dr. Truman during the recess.",
        "Todd: Can I ask why? Why of all the doctors in the world, why Dr. Saybrooke?",
        "Judge: Sit down, Mr. Manning.",
        "Todd: No, I'm sorry, I have to say that this is blatantly unfair. I dot know how she's going to be objective.",
        "Judge: Mr. Manning, I said sit down. Another outburst like that and I will have you removed from this courtroom.",

        "Jessica: Hello.",
        "Antonio: We were, but we decided to come home early.",

        "Antonio: Hi, baby.",
        "Jessica: Oh, look at her. She's gotten so big. We missed you so much!",
        "Nash: Is that why you came back, because you missed her?",
        "Antonio: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Well, I just couldn't stop thinking about her.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, that's the way I feel when I'm away from her. But then, of course, we feel that way -- she's our daughter. She's a part of us.",

        "Michael: So, you planning on asking Natalie to marry you or not?",
        "John: I told her how I felt about her.",
        "Michael: Well, it's about damn time.",
        "John: No one in their right mind wants to ask someone to spend the rest of their life with them from a hospital bed.",
        "Michael: You're having second thoughts, huh?",
        "Natalie: What is going on?",
        "Marcie: You're not going to believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mark: Your honor, u and everyone else in this courtroom witnessed my client have a nervous breakdown on the stand. Now, it's my contention that he's no longer fit to stand trial. Dr. Saybrooke has met the defendant previously and is familiar with his history.",
        "Spencer: History. Your honor --",
        "Mark: Spencer?",
        "Spencer: This fraud is a witness. All right, I'm Dr. Spencer Truman, a very esteemed --",
        "Mark: Spencer --",
        "Spencer: Surgeon and very important member of this community.",
        "Mark: Spencer, I need you to sit need.",
        "Spencer: I'm not crazy.",

        "Spencer: That was good, right?",
        "Mark: Sit down.",
        "Spencer: That was good?",
        "Mark: That was fine.",
        "Judge: I'm going to allow Dr. Saybrooke to testify.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Why would you say something like that? You know that it's upsetting.",
        "Nash: No, just -- I was -- I was just stating a fact. We're her parents.",
        "Jessica: Well, it's also a fact that Antonio --",
        "Antonio: Don't, Jessica. I'm not upset. Nash is Bree's father. The one thing we know for sure is that you love your daughter very much.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: We appreciate you keeping her for us while we were gone.",
        "Nash: Well, and I enjoyed every moment of it. So why did you guys come back? What, was there bad weather?",
        "Jessica: Oh, sweetie --",
        "Antonio: No, no, no. It was actually perfect. And we enjoyed the few days we were there, but, like Jessica said, we missed Bree and Jamie.",
        "Jessica: Yes, we did. We missed you so much! Did you miss us, sweetheart? Hmm?",
        "Antonio: Hi. Look at that smile.",
        "Jessica: Mmm. [Jessica kisses Bree] [Antonio chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I got a second chance. I just want to do it right.",
        "Michael: Mom actually brought the engagement ring and -- When we still thought you were dead. You ok?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Oh. Mom gave the engagement ring to Natalie.",
        "John: I see.",
        "Michael: Now, look, I mean, it's not like she's going to be any less thrilled when you slide it on her finger yourself. You know, when Natalie first thought you were alive but couldn't get any proof, she actually -- well, she tried to dig up your grave to get a D.N.A. sample.",
        "John: Natalie.",
        "Michael: Yeah. No surprise there.",
        "John: She's lucky she didn't get busted.",
        "Michael: It -- it still hurts to talk, huh?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, you inhaled a lot of smoke. But figure, little while, you'll be back to your old monosyllabic self. Sorry.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Michael: That -- that wasn't funny, was it?",
        "John: It's ok. It was kind of funny.",
        "Michael: Johnny, man, I'm -- I'm just so damn happy you're alive.",
        "John: How bad is it, mike?",
        "Michael: What?",
        "John: The burns, my face?",
        "Michael: Not too bad.",
        "John: I want to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Your honor, I know this witness, and I have to ask that she be recused on the grounds of prejudice.",
        "Judge: Against whom?",
        "Evangeline: Todd Manning. Based on her personal history with Todd Manning, it is not possible for her to be objective. And therefore, the validity of her testimony would be compromised.",
        "Judge: But Mr. Manning is neither a principal nor a witness in this case.",
        "Evangeline: But his ex-wife is, your honor.",
        "Judge: Ms. Williamson, does Dr. Saybrooke have a direct connection to either the defendant or to the victim's family?",
        "Evangeline: She has a direct connection to the key witness in this case, your honor, but not to the accused.",
        "Judge: Then I see no reason for prejudice. Dr. Saybrooke, you may take the stand.",
        "Bailiff: Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?",
        "Marty: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, honestly. The way his smile just lights up his little face.",
        "Kelly: I know.",
        "Viki: Do you know when he grabbed my finger --",
        "Kelly: Quite a grip, huh?",
        "Viki: Yes -- I was so impressed.",
        "Kelly: So are the doctors.",
        "Viki: So that means they're going to release him from the hospital pretty soon, right?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, yeah, I think so, and then Zane and I can join Kevin in London.",
        "Viki: Kelly, are you really sure about this? It's such a big move.",
        "Kelly: I am sure. I -- I would've told you if I had changed my mind. Oh, excuse me.",
        "Waitress: Hi.",
        "Kelly: Could I get a club soda? Do you want a club soda?",
        "Viki: That'd be great, thank you.",
        "Waitress: Sure, no problem.",
        "Kelly: Do you not approve?",
        "Viki: Oh, it's not that at all. I want what's best for you, honey, if it's going to make you happy.",
        "Kelly: Well, I never would've made this decision if I didn't think it was going to make me happy.",
        "Viki: No, I'm -- I guess what I'm concerned about is that you might be very lonely over there, you know? Your -- your friends, your family, they're all here.",
        "Kelly: I know, and I'm going to miss everybody so much, but I just need to get away from the sadness and from the bad memories, start someplace new, and maybe when we're not so much in the spotlight, Kevin and I can come back and we can live here and be happy and enjoy it, but right now, I just want to concentrate on making new memories with my son and with Kevin. And I got to tell you, there is something so exciting about starting a new life in a -- in a new place, a new home.",
        "Viki: Well, it's all about hope, isn't it?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Do you think you can stay at least until Christmas? Would you consider that?",
        "Kelly: We'll see. But you have so much to celebrate this year. I mean, Jessica is a married woman, she's got a beautiful new baby, and --",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know.",
        "Kelly: John is alive, so this is going to be the best Christmas in Natalie's life.",
        "Viki: I hope so. That child really deserves some happiness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You want to see yourself? Yeah. Yeah, fine. Ok, but you know, they don't usually leave mirrors just lying around hospital rooms, you know?",
        "John: Look in the drawer.",
        "Michael: Who knew? Listen, I want you to understand -- you still have a lot of reconstructive surgery, healing, skin grafts. It's going to be a long --",
        "John: Show me, mike. Just do it.",
        "Michael: Ok.",
        "John: Well, those -- those scars are going to be kind of hard to shave around.",
        "Michael: Like you need another excuse not to shave.",
        "John: It's not that bad, right?",
        "Michael: Not bad at all.",
        "John: So when do I get out of here?",
        "Michael: Well, you have to regain your strength, mobility, you know? There's going to be a lot more surgeries and -- and the thing is when you have such extensive burning, you -- you have a very large risk of infection.",
        "John: Truman's trial.",
        "Michael: Should be over soon. They're going into closing arguments today, maybe tomorrow.",
        "John: Well, maybe I'll be out in time for the execution.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mark: Dr. Saybrooke, I understand you had the chance to examine Dr. Truman prior to his breakdown on the stand.",
        "Marty: I did. We had six sessions, enough for me to get a sense of his normal behavior.",
        "Mark: And you had the chance to examine him again this afternoon during the recess.",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Mark: Well, could you please tell the court in your opinion his current mental state.",
        "Marty: I found Dr. Truman highly delusional, out of touch with reality, with his surroundings.",
        "Mark: Is it correct to say that he was agitated?",
        "Marty: Extremely, yes.",
        "Mark: Well, then, given his extreme agitation, did you find it necessary to sedate him?",
        "Marty: I gave him a sedative.",
        "Mark: Now, would you say, Dr. Saybrooke, that what we saw in court, what Dr. Truman experienced, was a full-blown psychotic episode?",
        "Marty: You could call it that, yes.",
        "Spencer: Objection, your honor. I move that that statement be stricken from the record.",
        "Judge: Sit down, Dr. Truman.",
        "Spencer: Thank you very much.",
        "Judge: Sit down. Mr. Casey?",
        "Spencer: Obvious to me that my attorney has become quite smitten with the witness, wants to have me committed so he --",
        "Judge: Sit down and be quiet!",
        "Spencer: Can have her all to himself.",
        "Mark: Spencer. Please.",
        "Spencer: Never mind.",
        "Mark: Dr. Saybrooke, would you say that Dr. Truman's behavior just now -- his paranoid reaction to your testimony, his incoherent ramblings -- are all part of what you agreed was a psychotic break?",
        "Marty: I would, yes.",
        "Mark: Well, then, could you please tell the court in layman's terms what you suspect might have led to his breakdown?",
        "Marty: Well, reading the transcript of what he said on the stand during the episode, I would have to say it was his recent incarceration. It was obviously a shock to his system -- the solitude, austrophobia, and humiliation.",
        "Mark: Anything else?",
        "Marty: Dr. Truman feels he's been betrayed by the woman he planned to marry, Blair Cramer, and more importantly, by his mother. Both women have caused him a great deal of anguish.",
        "Evangeline: Objection. Conjecture.",
        "Mark: Your honor, Ms. Cramer's testimony is a matter of record, and Dr. Saybrooke's expert evaluation of my client's mental state is ordered by the court.",
        "Judge: Objection overruled. Proceed, Mr. Casey.",
        "Marty: Dr. Truman, as everyone well knows, is a prominent surgeon. I believe the kind of pressure he's been under -- patients entrusting their very lives to him -- has made him vulnerable to depression even before the arrest. In fact, he told me he has suffered severe mood swings throughout his life. And as I said before, for a man like him to be incarcerated would be psychologically debilitating to say the least, and add to that his sense of betrayal, particularly by his mother, the recent loss of his son -- it would all be too much for him and, to put it in layman's terms as you suggested, he finally snapped.",
        "Mark: Then is it your expert opinion that Dr. Truman is mentally and emotionally unfit to stand trial?",
        "Marty: It is.",
        "Mark: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Oh, she is lying, your honor. He is faking it and Marty Saybrooke is lying through her teeth!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Antonio: It's ok.",
        "Jessica: What's wrong, sweetie? Oh, she must be hungry.",
        "Nash: I'll get her bottle.",
        "Antonio: That should do the trick, huh?",
        "Nash: I kept her on the same schedule she was on before you guys left, so --",
        "Jessica: I'm sure you did a wonderful job. Thank you.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- perfect. You want to feed her?",
        "Jessica: It's just I haven't seen her in a couple of days, so I --",
        "Nash: Yeah. That's fine.",
        "Jessica: You know what? You go ahead.",
        "Nash: No, no, no. It's like you said, it's cool.",
        "Jessica: Nash --",
        "Nash: I'll get used to it.",
        "Jessica: I have her all the time. It's ok, go ahead.",
        "Nash: Ah, I --",
        "Antonio: Feed the kid. She's hungry.",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Nash: Come here, come here. Hey.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Nash: Hey -- ooh. Hungy? You hungy?",
        "Antonio: Ah. Speaking of hungry --",
        "Nash: Here we go.",
        "Antonio: We're going home to an empty fridge.",
        "Jessica: Oh, yeah. I forgot. You know, I'm going to go grocery shopping first thing in the morning tomorrow.",
        "Nash: Well, if you guys need diapers or formula, I got lots here, so --",
        "Antonio: No, actually, we're -- we're cool on that. I'm talking about us, you know, tonight. How about a Rodi's burger?",
        "Jessica: Mmm. Yeah, that sounds good.",
        "Antonio: You want to come?",
        "Nash: Who, me? No, I -- you -- [Nash chuckles] You guys are still on your honeymoon, technically, right? You should be alone.",
        "Antonio: Dude, are you hungry or not?",
        "Nash: Yeah, I am, but come on.",
        "Jessica: Listen, I'm going to dress her up in her new outfit that we bought her in Puerto Rico. Trust me, you wouldn't want to miss it.",
        "Nash: No, I wouldn't want to do that.",
        "Antonio: So you're coming?",
        "Nash: They're making us an offer we can't refuse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: All righty, then. That's enough narcissism for one day. Hey, hey. You want to see somebody real handsome? I think I got a picture here somewhere. There it is. Tommy.",
        "John: Yeah, he's a real good-looking kid. Obviously adopted.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I guess I kind of just stepped right into that one, didn't I?",
        "John: I want to see him soon.",
        "Michael: Are you kidding me? You and your nephew have a lot of bonding to do. But I want you to understand, it's going to be a while, John, you know? You got a lot of skin grafts, you got a lot of healing. And I tell you, brother -- you're going to be in a world of pain.",
        "John: Worth it.",
        "Michael: Oh, you bet it is. Hey, did you know that they got Antonio doing your old job?",
        "John: Tell him not to hang any pictures.",
        "Michael: I'll pass it along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I can't believe this.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: I will have order in this court immediately! The next person who speaks out of turn in this courtroom will be thrown out and not allowed back for the remainder of this trial. Is that clear?",
        "Blair: How could you be so calm?",
        "Todd: You make a scene, you get tossed.",
        "Judge: Ms. Williamson, do you have any questions --",
        "Todd: That what you want?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Judge: For this witness? Evangeline I do --",
        "Judge: Please, proceed.",
        "Evangeline: Your honor, thank you. Hello, Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Marty: Hi.",
        "Evangeline: Several weeks ago, the court appointed you to do a psychiatric evaluation of Dr. Truman. Is that correct?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Evangeline: And as stated in earlier testimony, you did six sessions with Dr. Truman?",
        "Marty: I did.",
        "Evangeline: Dr. Saybrooke, have you ever known a patient, either yours or a colleague's, to fake a mental breakdown?",
        "Marty: I've heard of it, yes.",
        "Evangeline: But has it ever happened to you with one of your patients?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Evangeline: As far as you know?",
        "Marty: Excuse me?",
        "Evangeline: Well, I mean, if someone was good at faking, you couldn't know.",
        "Mark: Objection. What's the point?",
        "Evangeline: I assure you there is a point, your honor, if the court would allow me a little leeway.",
        "Judge: Overruled. Proceed, Ms. Williamson.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you, your honor. So, Dr. Saybrooke, could you at least conceive that it's possible that you had a patient that was faking a mental breakdown and you didn't know it?",
        "Marty: I suppose.",
        "Evangeline: Then I believe it's also fair to conclude that Dr. Truman could be faking this mental breakdown.",
        "Marty: I'm a psychiatrist, Ms. Williamson. If a patient were faking a mental breakdown, I --",
        "Evangeline: I'm sure, I'm sure you want to believe that you would see through it, but let's face it -- none of us are immune to deception. I mean, brilliant actors convince us all the time that they're actually crying or they're laughing or they're emotionally breaking down and -- and we're very moved, but we know they're just acting.",
        "Marty: The defendant has ongoing psychological problems.",
        "Evangeline: Unless he's a very good actor, and Dr. Truman fooled a lot of people in this town, a lot of very smart people --",
        "Mark: Objection.",
        "Judge: Sit down, Mr. Casey --",
        "Evangeline: For a very long time.",
        "Judge: And let Ms. Williamson continue.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you, your honor, but I believe I've made my point. But I will elucidate for the court. For Dr. Saybrooke to draw absolute conclusions about Dr. Truman's mental stability or the lack thereof based upon what amounts to approximately one month of therapy before the alleged mental breakdown and only one session afterwards is presumptuous if not downright ludicrous, and I reserve the right to recall this witness and I request a recess so that I can arrange to have Dr. Truman evaluated by another psychiatrist.",
        "Judge: Dr. Saybrooke, you're excused for now. This court will reconvene in the morning. In the meantime, the prisoner will be taken under a 24-hour suicide watch. [Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Spencer: All right, that -- whoa, whoa, whoa! Judge, come back. No, that's it.",
        "Mark: Spencer --",
        "Spencer: I'm --",
        "Mark: Spencer --",
        "Natalie: I cannot believe that Spencer is trying to pull this.",
        "Marcie: I'm not going to tell Michael. He's going to be furious.",
        "Spencer: I want to be put back on the stand!",
        "Natalie: Well, there's no way in hell that he's going to get away with it.",
        "Spencer: Judge!",
        "Mark: Spencer, easy.",
        "Marcie: Blair? Hi. I know you have a lot going on right now. Michael wanted me to just remind you about your appointment.",
        "Blair: Ok, I'll be there.",
        "Marcie: Ok. All right.",
        "Blair: Thank you. Thank you, Marcie.",
        "Spencer: You don't have to keep lying --",
        "Blair: Shut up.",
        "Spencer: To protect that nasty man who --",
        "Blair: Shut up, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: What did he do to you?",
        "Blair: Bailiff, would you get this crazy man away from me?",
        "Spencer: I'll take care of it. I'll protect you.",

        "Marty: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Blair: Marty, don't you walk -- Marty. Marty, don't you -- don't walk away from me!",
        "Todd: Hello? Evangeline, don't you think this is Marty's revenge against me?",
        "Blair: Well, of course it is. Marty's trying to get back at the two of us, Todd. Can't you see that, Evangeline?",
        "Evangeline: Whatever her motive was, the question is whether Casey's tactic will work. Excuse me. I have to go call Nora.",
        "Blair: Huh. Well --",
        "Evangeline: You know, I know what happened between Todd and Marty in the past. And I can only imagine how you must feel about it, Blair. But it has no bearing at all on this case. I'm going to go do my job.",
        "Blair: Please. [Blair sighs]",
        "Todd: You're looking a little pale.",
        "Blair: I did not pretend to be in love with that despicable man for months just to see him beat this, Todd. I want him to pay! I want Spencer to pay. Maybe even more than you do.",

        "Marcie: Hi. Is that Bree?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. Look.",

        "Viki: I think so, too. Where's your son?",

        "Kelly: Is something wrong?",
        "Marcie: Well -- I just came from the courthouse.",
        "Viki: Oh, won't you sit down?",
        "Marcie: Oh, thanks. Yeah -- in a -- in a nutshell, Spencer had a breakdown on the stand. Well, at least, he pretended to have a breakdown. And then the judge called a recess so that a doctor could come in and examine him. And the doctor turned out to be Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Viki: What did she say?",
        "Marcie: She backed up his insanity act. I don't want to tell Michael.",
        "Kelly: Oh, my God.",
        "Viki: Todd's going to be livid.",
        "Marcie: Well, he sure isn't happy.",

        "Michael: Johnny, you know, I know I've said it a million times, and I'll probably say it a million times more -- I -- I'm just -- I'm so happy to have you back, man. I'm so --",
        "John: Hug me, and I will beat you with my bedpan.",

        "Michael: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm. How's he doing?",
        "Michael: Surprisingly, he's doing very well. Really good mood. You didn't go home, did you? I mean, like, you didn't go home at all?",

        "Jessica: Ok. John's alive? Oh, my God! It's a miracle.",
        "Viki: It is a miracle. It's -- it's fantastic. I mean, he has a long recovery ahead of him, but he's alive.",
        "Jessica: I can hardly wait to talk to Natalie.",
        "Viki: Natalie has not left his side. And I'm sure she's there right now. And of course, he's not allowed any visitors, except family, so --",

        "Michael: Is something wrong?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Michael: Marty --",
        "Blair: Marty Saybrooke. She's the psychiatrist that testified on Spencer's behalf. Said that he had the psychotic breakdown and was unable to stand trial.",
        "Michael: And the judge bought this?",
        "Blair: I don't know. He took a recess and said Evangeline could get a second opinion.",
        "Michael: Whew. I'm telling you, if this guy gets to serve out his time in an institution --",
        "Blair: It's so obvious --",
        "Michael: Rather than in a prison --",
        "Blair: That Spencer was faking it.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Obvious to everybody except Marty Saybrooke, of course. Now --",
        "Michael: Just take a breath. Listen, you are under an incredible amount of stress right now --",
        "Blair: No, she did it deliberately.",
        "Michael: Let's talk --",
        "Blair: She did it deliberately to hurt Todd and me. I know that.",
        "Michael: Blair, stop, now. I'm your doctor. So, why don't we take your blood pressure?",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah, take my blood pressure. I'm sure it's -- it's just straight out the roof, thanks to that witch.",
        "Mark: So you'll call me to schedule another examination with my client? With a psychiatrist of your choosing, of course?",

        "Evangeline: My effort will make that little show you and Truman just put on a complete waste of time.",

        "Todd: Hey. That's a nice job, dirtbag.",
        "Mark: Excuse me?",
        "Todd: This -- this scheme of yours and Truman's. That's a nice job. It's not going to work, though. Truman's going to fry.",
        "Mark: Don't hold your breath.",
        "Todd: Your client's in for the shock of his life, see. And he's not going to see it coming.",
        "Spencer: I'm not talking to you. Not anymore. You told them you thought I was nuts.",
        "Marty: I don't think you're nuts, Dr. Truman. I just don't think you're competent to stand trial. And just because I don't think you're competent, I still believe you could be guilty.",
        "Spencer: So you're not on my side, then?",
        "Marty: I have nothing to do with deciding your fate. I'm here to help, that's all. Look, and the only way I can do my job is if you are completely honest with me about -- about what you think and how you feel.",
        "Spencer: And the things I've done? [Spencer chuckles]",
        "Marty: Of course.",
        "Spencer: Listen to this, doc. I've done things that even a shrink like you would not believe.",
        "Marty: Why don't you let me decide that for myself? Remember, anything you say will be protected under the doctor/patient confidentiality it would be inadmissible in court.",

        "Natalie: So you and Michael were talking about me?",
        "John: You know, grave robbing is a felony.",

        "John: Hmm.",
        "Natalie: But, you know, you would have -- if you thought that I was alive, you know --",
        "John: I might have done the same thing?",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Well, I learned it from the best.",
        "John: Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.",
        "Natalie: Listen, I was thinking, I'm going to go get a sandwich and maybe hang around here tonight again, if that's ok with you.",
        "John: I'd like that.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Want anything?",
        "John: A newspaper. Unless maybe you want to fill me in on what's going on in the trial.",
        "Natalie: Um -- court recess for today, and defense hasn't rested yet.",
        "John: Michael told me about Truman's meltdown. Is there anything else?",

        "Antonio: That was another life. And it doesn't mean anything, not anymore.",
        "Reg: What kind of game are you playing? Bored little wifey looking for a little fun on the side? I'm down with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: You see, I know things that could destroy so many people's lives.",
        "Marty: What kind of things?",
        "Spencer: Uh-uh. No, no, no, no. [Spencer laughs]",
        "Marty: Wouldn't revealing your secrets be the best way to get back at the people who you believe are persecuting you?",
        "Spencer: Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'll tell you, maybe I won't. But the thing is I have learned over the years that it's always best to hold back a few cards that you haven't played yet.",
        "Marty: Huh. You need help, Spencer. I truly believe that.",
        "Spencer: No, you don't. You just want to punish Todd and Blair. Don't you?",
        "Marty: That's not true. My personal feelings have nothing to do with this.",
        "Blair: Michael, can we not tell anybody about this? I don't want anybody to know, ok?",
        "Michael: Blair, you're my patient. So anything and everything that we talk about right now is confidential. Besides, there's nothing to discuss until we get the test results back. You know? You need a C.T. scan.",
        "Blair: But you think the brain tumor's back, don't you?",
        "Michael: I never said that, you did. But it is something that we have to rule out.",
        "Blair: What if it is back?",
        "Michael: Then we deal with it. Look, let's -- let's not speculate. Let's -- let's just deal with the problems at hand, ok? We'll wait for your test results to come back, and I'll schedule you an appointment with a neurologist.",

        "Todd: Yeah, fine.",
        "Viki: Marcie told me about Marty Saybrooke's testimony.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I -- I'm not worried about it, though. Truman's going to get his, one way or another.",

        "John: Just tell me, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Well, after Spencer had his little meltdown, his lawyer brought in a shrink. They're trying to say that he's unfit for trial. You should have seen him. You should have seen Truman and his sleazy lawyer. They really think that they're going to get away with it, John.",
