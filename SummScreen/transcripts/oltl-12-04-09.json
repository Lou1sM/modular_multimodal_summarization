        "Ross escapes from prison and goes to find Dani at the Seattle hospital before Todd and Tea have a chance to take her away. They persuade Elijah and the guards to let them leave also. Ross holds Destiny hostage and tells the others that he will kill her if they do not so what he says. He is very afraid that Todd and Tea will take his daughter way from him now that they have discovered that she is not his. Matthew is still unable to get out of his bed and help his two friends. Back in Llanview, Dorian spends the night in jail, confident about winning the mayoral election and winning the support of the gay community until she notices that Mitch Laurence is in jail right beside her. He taunts her and presses her buttons. Meanwhile, gay bashers harass and assault Nick and Amelia. Gigi is alone with Schuyler while Rex and Shane go alone to Ultraviolet where Stacy and Kim are there to humiliate them."

        "Todd: Tell her to stay put.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Rachel, don't let Daniella leave Matthew's room.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay? Because Ross -- Ross escaped and he has a loaded gun.",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. And he's looking for Daniella.",
        "Rachel: Oh, my God.",

        "Cole: All right here?",
        "Langston: No, let's get closer. That's why we came here early.",
        "Markko: Get any closer and we're onstage. Let's go back a little.",
        "Langston: Oh, well, Tyson wants me up front.",
        "Markko: Who?",
        "Langston: Tyson Ritter. He's the lead singer of All-American Rejects, and my other boyfriend.",
        "Markko: Yeah, well, can he turn you into a star? Because I'm all about that.",
        "Starr: The sitter says Hope is sleeping like an angel.",
        "Markko: So, exactly like she was a half-hour ago?",
        "Cole: No. She's probably, like, rolled over or something.",
        "[Markko and Langston laugh]",
        "Starr: You know, you guys, just wait.",
        "Cole: Yeah, you'll see. When you're a parent, it's all about your kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All right. Mom rules.",
        "Shane: Extra fries. Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Tomorrow night, I cook, with vegetables.",
        "Shane: Well, Mom rules tonight.",
        "Gigi: Hey, at least it's a family dinner.",
        "Rex: Yeah. So, Christmas list -- I haven't heard any of it.",
        "Shane: Is it gonna be a family Christmas?",
        "Rex: Just our family.",
        "Shane: All of it?",
        "Rex: You don't have to worry about Mitch Laurence.",
        "Shane: I meant Roxy.",
        "Rex: Oh.",
        "Shane: I'm not worried about that Mitch guy. He's locked up in California, right?",
        "Rex: We need to talk about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Is that Dr. Dorian Lord?",
        "Oliver: That's Mayor Lord to you. Wait a minute. Aren't you --",
        "Dorian: Mitch Laurence.",
        "Mitch: Mayor. Really? So, Your Honor -- what are you in for?",
        "Dorian: So it's true. You're alive.",
        "Mitch: No matter how many times you try to kill me.",
        "Dorian: Three's the charm.",
        "Mitch: Are you threatening me in front of an officer of the law?",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry. I didn't hear anything.",
        "Mitch: You look well, Mrs. Laurence.",
        "Dorian: I had that disaster annulled.",
        "Mitch: Hmm. Good thing, too. You wouldn't want to add bigamy to your list of crimes. Yes, I heard you married again. How is the missus? Does she make you feel as good as I used to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Who wears the dress in this family?",
        "Amelia: Get lost.",
        "Man: Or you gonna call your wife on us?",
        "Second Man: Oh, she's one scary broad.",
        "Nick: You know what? Leave us alone.",
        "Man: No, you leave us alone. All right, we don't need your trash in our faces.",
        "Second Man: You got men marrying men, women with women.",
        "Third Man: What's next? Man with dog?",
        "Amelia: Oh, you'd make a perfect groom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you, Rachel. Okay, now what?",
        "Elijah: Now we wait for the police to find Ross.",
        "Todd: Oh, no. The hell with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: How's Mom? Freaked out?",
        "Rachel: She's relieved you're okay. Greg, can I speak to you outside for a second?",
        "Greg: Sure.",
        "Rachel: You guys listen to me. Nobody leave this room. Are we clear? We're gonna be right outside that door.",
        "Dani: Thanks so much for ratting me out.",
        "Destiny: Sorry.",
        "Dani: No, you're not. You did it on purpose. Now my mom's gonna take me to Timbuktu and hide me in a basement or something.",
        "Destiny: Your mother is not like that.",
        "Dani: She'll do anything to keep me away from my dad. I'll never see any of you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: So what's up?",
        "Rachel: Ross Rayburn escaped from jail. He's looking for Dani with a gun. We need to make sure he doesn't find her.",

        "Oliver: I'll -- I'll see if I can get him moved.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",
        "Oliver: I'm -- I'm sorry about this. Arresting you and --",
        "Dorian: No, you were just doing your job. Anyway, it's just for one night, and if it helps the cause, then it's the very least I can do.",
        "Oliver: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "Mitch: You are good.",
        "Dorian: I believe it.",
        "Mitch: Well, that's what makes it such a convincing sales pitch. But I know you too well. You only believe in one thing -- Dorian Lord. And money. Isn't that why you married me?",
        "Dorian: In name only. And it's the worst mistake I made in my life.",
        "Mitch: The worst mistake of your life? Wow. That's saying a lot. I'm flattered. And now you're married to a woman?",
        "Dorian: That's right.",
        "Mitch: Hmm. That explains a lot. I mean, your track record with men says it all. Let's see. Clint Buchanan broke off your engagement. Ray Montez escaped before you could have him fully domesticated. And then there's Vickers. I guess he qualifies as a man. Even he finally had too much.",
        "Dorian: And how do you know so much?",
        "Mitch: God is always watching.",
        "Dorian: Amen. But he doesn't tell everything he sees to the devil.",
        "Mitch: Now that is harsh.",
        "Dorian: Accurate. You are -- Satan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Mitch Laurence is in Llanview?",
        "Gigi: In jail, honey. He's not out on the street. You won't run into him.",
        "Shane: How did he get out?",
        "Rex: Well, he must have a really good lawyer, because they let him go in California. But he's not gonna get out here. Bo's in charge now.",
        "Shane: Good.",
        "Gigi: Yes, it's good.",
        "Schuyler: Hi.",
        "Gigi: Oh, hi.",
        "Shane: Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: Yo. How's it going?",
        "Gigi: I thought you were off tonight.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Glen's sick, so I'm covering.",
        "Gigi: Oh. You didn't say that at the house.",
        "Schuyler: I hadn't gotten the call yet.",
        "Rex: What's up?",
        "Gigi: Oh, Rex, I totally forgot. Schuyler came by to see you today.",
        "Rex: Me? Why?",
        "Schuyler: Why would I care what idiot she slept with?",
        "Kim: Because, you big dummy, it's you. You're the father.",
        "Schuyler: I wanted to tell you something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Hanging low.",
        "Stacy: God, this thing is a pain in the butt!",
        "Kim: Wait till you're 6 months pregnant and that really is blubber and baby.",
        "Stacy: Thank you so much for that mental picture. I feel like a science experiment as it is. God. Thank God this pregnancy is not forever.",
        "Kim: No, but the kid is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: 15 minutes.",
        "Starr: Huh?",
        "Cole: We can have fun for another 15 minutes before we call the babysitter again.",
        "Starr: I'm having fun.",
        "Langston: Okay. [Laughs]",
        "Starr: What? I am. I think it's good to have some relaxing time before finals.",
        "Markko: Oh, don't say that.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Cole: The ultimate f-word.",
        "Langston: Oh, come on, you guys have been doing great this semester.",
        "Markko: I still have to edit my final project.",
        "Cole: And I have a term paper on psychology.",
        "Starr: Well, if you want a case study, there's always my family.",
        "Markko: I thought things were normal now.",
        "Starr: On the Cramer-Manning psycho scale, yeah. But still.",
        "Langston: Why? What's up?",
        "Starr: Well, my dad went off to Seattle to chase after T\u00e9a.",
        "Langston: In a good way?",
        "Starr: He wants to work things out with her. I think. I don't know. I don't know all the details.",
        "Cole: That's gotta be messy.",
        "Starr: Of course it is. It's my dad.",
        "Markko: Do you ever get tired of being the grownup in your family?",
        "Starr: Yes. But I still hope my dad finds what he's looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There's gotta be more we can do.",
        "T\u00e9a: What about our bail? Can we get out of here?",
        "Elijah: I doubt they're even thinking about that right now.",
        "Todd: I don't want Rayburn anywhere near my daughter.",
        "Elijah: Yeah, well, the cops are working on that, too.",
        "Todd: You know what? Give me your phone.",
        "Elijah: Why?",
        "Todd: I'm gonna call this private security force I know. They'll find him.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you find Ross?",
        "Guard: We found a cabbie that picked up a fare around the corner from here. Brought him downtown. The guy didn't pay. Fits Ross's description.",
        "Todd: Where did he get out?",
        "Guard: Near the Barlow Hotel.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's where we were staying.",
        "Elijah: Right, so, he's gone to pick up Dani's things, maybe try to figure out where she went.",
        "T\u00e9a: He didn't go to the hotel. Oh, God. Oh, God.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: The hospital's right across the street from the hotel. That's where he went.",
        "Guard: Why would he want to go to the hospital?",
        "Todd: That's where our daughter is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Okay. Not a word. No. You so much as twitch, your girlfriend gets a bullet, okay?",
        "Greg: Okay, okay. But look. If that gun goes off, you know what's gonna happen? Every alarm in this hospital is gonna go off, those swinging doors are gonna lock down, and you're not gonna get two feet away from here before getting caught.",
        "Ross: Okay. All right. Then I got nothing to lose, do I?",
        "Greg: Can we just work something out here?",
        "Ross: We can work something out. Move. Move. Move. Move. Okay, we're gonna work something out when I go in and see my daughter, okay?",
        "Rachel: This isn't the way, Ross.",
        "Ross: This is the way we're gonna do it. You two are gonna stay right in here. I'm gonna go in there. Not one move or there's trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I guess they'll put me back in Child Protective Services until my parents get out of jail. I can't believe I just said that.",
        "Matthew: Maybe they could release you to Rachel.",
        "Dani: My mom will still be making the rules. Nice work, Destiny.",
        "Ross: Stay back.",
        "Dani: Daddy?",
        "[Ross breathing heavily]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Wait, wait, wait. If you make a move now, he might start shooting.",
        "Greg: Yes, this is Dr. Gregory Evans. I'm at Seattle General. We've got a man with a gun on the fourth floor east.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Hey, sweetie. Daddy's here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Schuyler came by before the funeral to say how sorry he was about Jared.",
        "Rex: Really.",
        "Schuyler: I -- I gotta -- I'm gonna set up.",
        "Shane: Can I have dessert?",
        "Gigi: Um --",
        "Rex: No time, buddy. I gotta get to Ultraviolet.",
        "Shane: Well, can't the babysitter pick me up here?",
        "Rex: No sitter tonight.",
        "Shane: Well, I can stay here and play pool, then?",
        "Rex: Better. How would you like to come to work with me?",
        "Shane: Tonight? The All-American Rejects are playing.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Can you stand it?",
        "Shane: Uh, I think so. Awesome!",
        "Rex: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gigi: All right, well, you be good and stay out of the mosh pit.",
        "Shane: I will.",
        "Gigi: I wish I could be there.",
        "Rex: Me, too.",
        "Gigi: Okay. Have a good time.",
        "Shane: We will.",
        "Rex: Okay.",
        "Gigi: Love you boys. Sorry about Rex.",
        "Schuyler: Uh, what about him?",
        "Gigi: Well, he was kind of rude, and it was really nice of you to stop by, and he just blew you off.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, no, it's okay.",
        "Gigi: He's going through a really hard time right now and he's really tense.",
        "Schuyler: No problem.",
        "Gigi: I know what you're doing for me and Rex and I just wish he could've been nicer.",
        "Schuyler: Huh. What I'm doing?",
        "Gigi: You kept Stacy from telling him about me staying with you that night.",
        "Schuyler: Right.",
        "Gigi: We both know nothing happened, but she would've made it sound as bad as possible, and that would've for sure sent him over the edge.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Glad I could help.",
        "Gigi: I still don't know how you got Kim and Stacy to keep their big mouths shut.",
        "Schuyler: We -- we made an agreement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Baby daddy, 2:00.",
        "Stacy: Did you want the waitress to hear you and tell Rex?",
        "Kim: Then we'd be done. And I have run out of good lies to cover this mess.",
        "Stacy: Yeah. You didn't have to tell Schuyler he was the baby's daddy.",
        "Kim: It was that or confess the whole thing. The guy caught you with your padding down. There was nothing else I could do, and it's working.",
        "Stacy: So far.",
        "Kim: Look, if Schuy was gonna claim this kid, he would've done it already. He wants Gigi. He'll keep his mouth shut.",
        "Stacy: I hope you're right.",
        "Kim: Trust me. I know men.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Hey, it's me. I got done at the hospital early so I just went ahead and headed to the club. I found a spot on the bar, so you can find me there. Can't wait to see you.",
        "Oliver: Me, too.",
        "Kyle: Hey.",
        "Oliver: Hey.",
        "Oliver: I am so sorry. I had to go home and change. It has just been a crazy day.",
        "Kyle: Yeah?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. I -- I arrested the mayor.",
        "Kyle: Again?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, right? And that was only the second weirdest part of the day. You will never believe who was in the holding cell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You know, Cole, if you don't feel like writing about Starr's dad --",
        "Cole: You don't think he'd like it? I mean, we're pretty close these days.",
        "Markko: Yeah, a big expose would go over real well.",
        "Langston: Okay, so do Dorian.",
        "Cole: Excuse me?",
        "Langston: You know, like, her wedding and becoming mayor.",
        "Markko: It's gonna get me an \"A\" on my film class final.",
        "Starr: Hmm, \"Road to City Hall\"?",
        "Markko: I had good stuff before, but when the attorney general showed up and Dorian getting arrested?",
        "Starr: You did make sure to get her good side, right?",
        "Markko: It's killer footage, and yes, she looks great.",
        "Starr: Because you know that that's key.",
        "Langston: Yeah. You know, I think she's really serious about same-sex marriage rights.",
        "Markko: I'm sure she is, but come on.",
        "Starr: No, Langston's right. I'm proud of her, too.",
        "Cole: But it never hurts to get her good side.",
        "Langston: I just hope this is it.",
        "Markko: What do you mean?",
        "Langston: I mean, she's been mayor less than 24 hours and she gets arrested? She never even made it to City Hall. What's next?",
        "Starr: Well, at least she'll have a quiet night, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How did you end up in Llanview? I read in the paper that you were in a California prison.",
        "Mitch: Oh, you know I don't do prison for long.",
        "Dorian: You're not gonna preach your way out of here.",
        "Mitch: Oh, there's always a way.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha ha. Not anymore. I am mayor of Llanview now. This is my jail.",
        "Mitch: Yes! Congratulations. You'll be very useful to me in your new job.",
        "Dorian: Oh? Me useful to you?",
        "Mitch: Yeah. You'll not only be useful, you'll enjoy it.",
        "Dorian: I am going to devote all of my energies to making sure you stay in here.",
        "Mitch: You know, that'd be so much more convincing if you weren't locked up yourself.",
        "Dorian: One night only.",
        "Mitch: You sure about that? It'll be interesting to see who gets out first.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: You got a smart mouth on you.",
        "Amelia: Well, I talk for a living. I'm a human rights advocate and I fight for my rights.",
        "Man: Yeah. We got your position.",
        "Nick: You know what? Let's go.",
        "Amelia: Does this make you feel like real men?",
        "Nick: Amelia, there's no point.",
        "Amelia: You're right, because some people just can't be educated.",
        "Man: Yeah?",
        "Amelia: Yeah. Because to convince people to change their mind, they'd actually have to have one.",
        "Man: Tinkerbell's nervous.",
        "Second Man: Those queers need a teaching moment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Yes. Just off the waiting room by the elevator. Hurry. We'll be waiting. The police are on their way. Are you okay?",

        "Ross: Well, I -- I didn't want to wait for all the paperwork, honey, and I was afraid your mom was gonna pull some kind of move, so --",
        "Destiny: You broke out?",
        "Dani: Did you?",
        "Ross: Oh, honey, I would do anything to keep from losing you. So, I'm gonna take you away from here.",

        "Dorian: You'll never get anywhere near her.",
        "Mitch: And little Starr. Well, she's become quite the young woman, huh? With a daughter of her own. You know, I love it that it's always a house full of women. Yeah. A baby girl. Hope. That is such a pretty name. And so true. She's the hope for all of us.",
