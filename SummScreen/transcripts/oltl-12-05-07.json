        "Viki: David, I hope you saved me some hot water!",
        "David: We would have saved more hot water if we'd showered together.",
        "Viki: Oh, I beg of you, give it a rest.",
        "David: Are you saving it for Charlie boy? Huh? Come on, Viki, don't you know the song? If you can't be with the one you love, honey \u266a",
        "Viki: I don't love Charlie, okay? We've had a few conversations and one official date. I don't even know the man's last name.",
        "David: But you want to, don't you?",
        "Viki: It -- it doesn't really matter what I want, does it? Because he's out of town.",
        "David: Are you still waiting for him to call you? I would never treat you like that.",
        "Viki: Yes, you would. And I'm sure that he has a perfectly good reason for not calling back.",

        "[Charlie groans]",
        "Michael: Looks like you need coffee as much as I do.",
        "Charlie: Do you mind telling me how I got here?",
        "Michael: You were in no condition to drive. I offered you my couch.",
        "Charlie: Oh. Hmm. Oh, you can forget the coffee. Because the best thing for a hangover is a little hair of the dog that bit you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Good morning.",
        "Starr: Well, it's morning, anyway.",
        "Blair: There might be someone here that can make it better.",
        "Starr: Is it Cole?",
        "Langston: Just us. Sorry.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Mom! Mom!",
        "John: Cole, stay back!",
        "Cole: No! Mom!",
        "John: Wait! Stay back!",
        "Cole: Mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Sahid -- heard you made the collar on the I.D. fraud. Way to go.",
        "Talia: Um -- thank you. I was just following my boss' orders.",
        "Antonio: Hey. How about I buy you a beer after work?",
        "Talia: No, thank you.",
        "Antonio: Talia -- everything cool between us?",
        "Talia: Sure. Why wouldn't they be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Everything okay?",
        "Rex: Sorry I'm late. U.V. biz.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: A new underwear for exposed?",
        "Adriana: No, it's my Christmas list.",
        "Rex: Oh, you don't have to worry about getting me something. I've already got everything I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hair-of-the-dog theory doesn't work. You know, it gives you a quick buzz, but it lowers your electrolytes, puts toxins back in your system. I'm a doctor.",
        "Charlie: Hmm. Oh, more booze never did me any good, anyway. Oh, I don't know what I was thinking last night. I don't know how I could have just buckled like that.",
        "Michael: Cut yourself some slack. Sometimes you just need to feel numb.",
        "Charlie: Well, not me, not anymore. I was dry for 10 months until last night.",
        "Michael: I'm sorry. God, if I had known --",
        "Charlie: No, that's not your fault. I'm supposed to stay out of places, people, and things that make me want to drink, and I didn't do that. So 10 months down the drain. I just hope that's not all it cost me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Look, would you -- would you put something on.",
        "David: I got a better idea. What do you say you and I play diner? You can be the sexy waitress and I'll be the customer who orders the \"daily special.\"",
        "Viki: How about you play busboy instead.",
        "David: Oh, come on, not that again. Can you really see me bussing tables?",
        "Viki: I've already seen you in an apron.",
        "David: And not much else, if I recall.",
        "Viki: Yeah, it was better than nothing.",
        "David: There is no way I'm bussing tables on a day after I almost scored a million bucks.",
        "Viki: What? Oh, it a minute. Okay, Dorian's not around, and Alex is broke. Where on earth did you find a woman to fleece for a million dollars in Paris, Texas?",
        "Marcie: Hey. Thank God -- thank God it was you, you know?",
        "Gigi: What's wrong? You look like you're about to keel right over.",
        "Marcie: Someone found me. Someone I know from home, and he threatened to turn me in for the reward money.",
        "Gigi: Well, then what are you still doing here?",
        "Marcie: He changed his mind. I don't know why, and I -- I don't know if he was on the level, and I feel like -- I feel like this is all closing in on me, and I -- I really -- I just -- I don't know what to do.",
        "Gigi: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: We just came by to see if you had heard anything about Cole.",
        "Markko: Yeah, Langston told me your dad set him up on a website for lost kids.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Me and my dad made it. He taught me how to do it and stuff.",
        "Dorian: Langston? I just tried to call you at the group home.",
        "Langston: Dr. Lord, you're back.",
        "Dorian: Please, won't you call me Dorian?",
        "Langston: I'll work on it.",
        "Dorian: I'm really sorry that I had to leave you.",
        "Langston: Oh, don't be. How was Texas? What's up with the cane?",
        "Dorian: Oh -- no big deal. I -- I had a little accident, but luckily, a very nice man helped me.",
        "Blair: Very handsome man named Charlie from Texas came in --",
        "Dorian: No, he's not from Texas. I met him in Texas.",
        "Langston: Well, I hope he's a lawyer.",
        "Blair: Is he?",
        "Dorian: I have no idea. I don't think so, but I'm sure he is going to be of great help. Speaking of which -- vitamin C, vitamin -- oh, Starr. You're back at it?",
        "Starr: I can't help it.",
        "Langston: So nothing, huh?",
        "Markko: I got all your homework. And I know it sucks, but it'll give you something to do.",
        "Blair: He's right, you know? This could keep your mind off things.",
        "Starr: Nothing's going to do that, Mom.",
        "Dorian: I know. After school, why don't the three of you jump on a train, go to Philadelphia?",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian, it is no use! Okay? Cole is missing, and he could be dead right now! Nothing is going to take my mind off of that!",
        "Blair: Starr -- Starr, come on. I think what she meant is that maybe a little distraction will help you through something like this, okay?",
        "Starr: Did you ever have a distraction when you couldn't find Dad? Dad can't stop thinking about my missing little brother, okay? He is out in a meeting right now with his PIs finding out their next move. I'm not allowed to be that worried about him?",
        "Blair: Starr, look, we're just trying to help, all right, sweetheart?",
        "Starr: And I appreciate it, but you guys don't understand. I'm not going to feel better until Cole is home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Flight attendant: Just let me know when you'd like your meals.",
        "John: Okay, thank you.",
        "Flight attendant: American, are you?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Flight attendant: Oh, you were on holiday in Ireland?",
        "John: No.",
        "Flight attendant: Oh, you got family there, then?",
        "Cole: We're not hungry, okay? Can you please go away?",
        "John: We left someone we care about there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I just hate seeing Starr like this.",
        "Blair: So do I. She's way too young.",
        "Dorian: Have you tried talking to her?",
        "Blair: Of course I have, but what am I supposed to say, give up? I can't do that.",
        "Dorian: No, of course not. We're Cramers. We don't give up. That's not how we're made.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Blair: Ms. Woodrow -- please, come in.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Hello, I am so sorry if I'm intruding.",
        "Blair: No, it's all right.",
        "Dorian: Not at all. Please, won't you come in?",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Thank you.",
        "Langston: I -- I'm not cutting school, if that's why you're here. There was meetings and --",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: No, I've come with news. The agency has made a determination in your case.",
        "Dorian: So, am I going to be Langston's foster mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Is there something you want to say?",
        "Talia: I'd like to be in on the interrogation, if that's okay with you, boss.",
        "Antonio: How long is this going to go on?",
        "Talia: How long is what going to go on?",
        "Antonio: Calling me \"boss\"?",
        "Talia: Well, you are my boss.",
        "Antonio: I'm also your friend. At least, I thought I was.",

        "[Adriana giggles]",
        "Adriana: You are trying to sneak a peek at my Christmas list.",
        "Rex: Do you really think I'd stoop to that? I really do love you.",
        "Adriana: How much did you see?",
        "Rex: You're getting your mom long leather gloves, your brother, one of those new phones everybody wants. Jamie, a hysterical doll --",
        "Adriana: Historical.",
        "Rex: Whatever. I didn't see my name in there.",
        "Adriana: Well, it's a very long list.",
        "Rex: I just thought mine might be higher up.",
        "Adriana: What happened to \"I have everything I want\"?",
        "Rex: Well, I do. It's just -- those new video mp3 players are hot, and they might run out of them at stores.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm. Well, the reason you didn't see your name on the list is because it's not on there.",
        "Rex: You're not getting me anything for Christmas?",
        "Adriana: I haven't decided what I want to get you for Christmas. I want it to be something significant and meaningful.",
        "Rex: Got it. Sorry if I sounded like a baby.",
        "Adriana: It was cute.",
        "Rex: I really am like a kid at Christmas, even though we didn't exactly deck the halls when I was living with Roxy.",
        "Adriana: I know. And that's why I want our first Christmas living together to be the absolute best.",
        "Rex: All right, but the -- the -- the tree, the eggnog, the carols -- the whole bit.",
        "Adriana: Absolutely. Oh, we'd better get going, because we told Michael we'd be at court for him.",
        "Rex: We still have time.",
        "Adriana: Do you think he's really going to beat the perjury charge?",
        "Rex: I don't think Michael even cares -- without Marcie and Tommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So you slipped up. You were upset about your son.",
        "Charlie: Uh -- what, I told you that, did I?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Charlie: You know, all I did last night was prove my kid was right -- once a drunk, always a drunk.",
        "Michael: He was probably just shocked to see you. Maybe if you try again --",
        "Charlie: She doesn't want any part of me, and I can't say that I blame him.",
        "Michael: What he gave you a chance?",
        "Charlie: No, it's too little too late. No, I made him a promise last night. I'm going to stay out of his life, and I'm going to keep that promise.",
        "Michael: Even if it kills you?",
        "Charlie: Better me than him. You know something? I better call my sponsor.",
        "[Charlie groans]",
        "Michael: Yeah, I got to get ready for court.",
        "Charlie: What, are you in some kind of trouble?",
        "Michael: Long story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I don't see any other way out of this, except to try and get to the border -- which I can't do because I don't have the money.",
        "Gigi: You don't have to go anywhere, just stay here.",
        "Marcie: No, I can't do that. I can't stay here, Gigi, okay? I can't stay here because Todd Manning already came here looking for me, and now there's this other guy, okay?",
        "Gigi: We handled Todd Manning, did we not? He thinks you're in South America.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, until this other guy tells him the truth.",
        "Gigi: But you said he wouldn't, right?",
        "Marcie: He's not exactly what I would call trustworthy, okay? And then there's this -- something else I did.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Marcie: I called Michael.",
        "Gigi: Oh, Marcie --",
        "Marcie: I thought I had to pay this other guy off, and so I called Michael and I asked him to get me the money. I know -- I know that it was crazy dragging him into this like he could ever help me get a million dollars. It's just -- after talking to him --",
        "Gigi: \"After talking to him\" what?",
        "Marcie: I remember that I loved him. And I've been crazy. Oh, Gigi, I've been so crazy. I -- I can't stand to lose Tommy -- you know that -- but hearing Mike's voice --",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Marcie: I want to be with him. I want this to be over, I want to go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: David -- I'm right, aren't I? It was a woman?",
        "David: Isn't it always.",
        "Viki: Okay, so what happened?",
        "David: You.",
        "Viki: Why me?",
        "David: Yeah, you were sitting up here on my shoulder in wings and a halo, just like you were when I gave the 10 million back to Clint.",
        "Viki: Are you kidding -- you're blaming me.",
        "David: You're damn right I'm blaming you. Mini-Me was on the other shoulder in red and horns making a very convincing argument, but he didn't stand a chance with you over here strumming on your harp.",
        "Viki: So, in other words, you did the right thing?",
        "David: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay, so how do you feel?",
        "David: Broke.",
        "Viki: And that's all?",
        "David: Okay, I feel kind of good.",
        "Viki: Yeah. I'm proud of you.",
        "David: Yeah, well, it's not going to buy me a bus ticket out of here.",
        "Viki: Oh, are you going?",
        "David: Why, have you changed your mind about playing diner?",
        "Viki: No, I don't think so.",
        "[David chuckles]",
        "David: Viki, this Charlie -- he really means that much to you?",
        "Viki: No, he does not, okay? I'm -- I'm just a little worried about him, gee.",
        "David: He's a lucky guy. I hope he treats you well.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "David: Because if he doesn't, I'm going to kick his butt! Or if he's bigger than me, I'll find someone who can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: You know, I don't -- I don't remember much about last night. But I do recall you saying something about someone taking your son? And -- and there's nothing you can do about it? Well, listen, take it from one who knows -- there's no way of getting that time away from them back.",
        "Michael: Oh, do you think I don't know that?",
        "Charlie: So what are you going to do, just sit there and take it?",
        "Michael: I wasn't given a choice.",
        "Charlie: No, there's always a choice. I mean, it's just up to you which one you make. Look -- um -- I'll get out of your hair. And -- wait a minute. Who's that?",
        "Michael: That's my wife. Why?",
        "Charlie: Well, I've seen her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: The suspense is killing me. Are we going to be allowed to have Langston come live with us?",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Your application's been approved, yes.",
        "Dorian: Oh, it's so wonderful!",
        "Langston: I can't believe it!",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's so wonderful!",
        "Langston: Thank you, Mrs. Woodrow, thank you so much!",
        "Dorian: Thank you, thank you!",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: You are so welcome.",
        "Langston: What happens now?",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Well --",
        "Dorian: Actually, I know what's going to happen. Yes! We are going to go straight to that Godforsaken group home, get your things, and bring you to your real, new home!",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Well, I will still need you to come down to the office, Dr. Lord, and fill out some paperwork.",
        "Dorian: Absolutely.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: But I just wanted to give you this news right away.",
        "Dorian: Oh, we are so grateful.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Congratulations.",
        "Dorian: So grateful. Thank you. Thank you for coming over here personally, I can't tell you how we appreciate it.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Bye-bye.",

        "Dorian: Bye-bye, have a great day.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: You, too.",
        "Markko: Didn't I tell you to keep the faith?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I can't believe that something good has actually happened.",
        "Blair: Langston? Welcome to the family, sweetie. Hmm.",
        "Dorian: All right, now, as soon as we get you moved in here, we have a few things to take care of -- one, we're going to go shopping --",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Dorian: Yes, we are. We're going to have our hair done, yes, and mani-pedis.",
        "Langston: \"Mani-pedi\"?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. Yeah, you've got to be ready to go to the ballet.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Langston: The -- the ballet?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes, yes, yes. \"Nutcracker Suite\" -- it's a major Cramer family --",
        "Blair: Oh, it's wonderful.",
        "Dorian: Christmas tradition. And you are, after all, our newest Cramer woman. What's the matter?",
        "Langston: I just keep thinking about last Christmas.",
        "Dorian: Uh-uh-uh-uh. Those dark days are over. And if you have never been to the ballet -- oh, it's so magical. Especially this particular --",
        "Blair: Hey. You all right, sweetie?",
        "Starr: Mom, I'm fine.",
        "Blair: I thought you would be happy that Langston was now a part of the family.",
        "Starr: I am happy. It's just as soon as I found out, I just really wanted to call Cole.",

        "Cole: I'm not his son.",
        "John: I -- um -- I don't think we need anything, thanks.",
        "Cole: I guess I'm nobody's son, huh? My dad's dead. My mom's dead. What am I supposed to do now, huh? What am I supposed to do without her?",
        "John: You're going to be okay. There's going to be a lot of people who will help you deal with what happened.",
        "Cole: What did happen? Huh? When I saw you, I thought everything was going to be all right. I mean, my mom and I were driving off in the van with that Simon guy, and you were supposed to give some information so they would let us go.",
        "John: That's what was supposed to happen. The tires blew out in the van. It went off the road.",
        "Cole: You found me. You saved my life.",
        "John: No. Your mother saved you. All she cared about was making sure you were alive. I wish I could've saved both of you.",
        "Cole: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I've got plans for later. So if we could just stick to business, that would be great.",
        "Antonio: Talia, we said some things the other night --",
        "Talia: My crush? I already told you -- it was, you know, juvenile and stupid.",
        "Antonio: It wasn't stupid.",
        "Talia: Look, I'm -- I'm sorry, but I -- I'm over it.",
        "Antonio: Well, if it's making it hard for us to work together, then I think that maybe we need to talk about it. Unless --",

        "Rex: I -- I just feel like it's my fault this whole thing happened.",
        "Adriana: Will you please stop beating yourself up for that?",
        "Rex: I was the first one to figure out that Tommy was Todd's son.",
        "Adriana: And we thought we were doing the right thing.",
        "Rex: And now things are more screwed up than ever. There's got to be something I can do.",
