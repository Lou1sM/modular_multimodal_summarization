    "Recap": [
        "Eddie holds Nora captive and puts his plan into motion, apparently as Clint has instructed him. He sends Bo a text from her phone about how he is very petty to be holding her indiscretion with Sam Rappaport, that happened so many years ago, against her. He's sitting with Inez at Buenos Dias when he gets the text. And he concludes that Nora is being a coward to send texts instead of talking to him directly. He does not suspect that anybody has put her up to writing that although Inez is able to put two and two together to figure out it's Clint that is prompting Eddie to break them up. Charlie takes Echo home. She kisses him and tells him he means so much to her. But he tells her that he is happily married. Unknown to them, however, Dorian appears outside the window to see them kissing. Echo convinces Charlie not to tell Viki that another woman kissed him in their living room, reminding him that Viki has a heart condition and also that Viki will throw her out of the house when she has no job, no money, nowhere to go and is the mother of Charlie's son. At that point, he agrees not to tell Viki. But Dorian wastes no time to let Viki know what she saw. Meanwhile, Joey tells both of his parents that he is going to marry Aubrey even though he barely knows her and knows very little about her. They both tell him he's rushing in and will regret it. But he does not listen. Kelly still has the idea that Joey is single and available to her. Rex goes inside Marty's home while she's out and almost gives up on finding anything until he discovers that she has Natalie's Ob-Gyn report inside a photo album she has of Cole."

        "John: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey. Good book?",
        "John: Yeah. Apparently, it's a bestseller.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Lots of people having babies.",
        "John: Makes me feel better, you know? If they can do it...",
        "Natalie: You're going to be fine. Plus, there are tons of people who just can't wait to help us. And wait till the baby shower, 'cause you're not going to believe all the stuff we're going to get. People just get generous when it comes to babies.",
        "John: Yeah, I guess so. I saw Marty earlier. She had a present for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Keys jingle]",
        "[Cell phone vibrates]",
        "Rex: Not a good time.",
        "Kelly: I have to talk to you.",
        "Rex: I'm in the field, Kelly. I can't talk.",
        "Kelly: So just listen. I'm a drink away from telling Joey I love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So is this your new girlfriend?",
        "Joey: No. Aubrey is not my girlfriend. Aubrey is the woman I'm going to marry.",
        "Viki: You're engaged, Joey?",
        "Joey: No, not yet. I have to ask the woman first. Aubrey Wentworth, will you do me the honor of accepting my proposal? Marry me, Aubrey, and make me the happiest man on the planet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Mmm. Mmm.",
        "[Phone chimes]",
        "Bo: Oh, sorry. It's--it's from Nora. I've been waiting.",
        "Inez: Oh, please, go ahead.",
        "Bo's voice: \"I'm still furious about what you said last night. I honestly don't know if I can ever forgive you.\"",
        "Inez: Is everything okay? Is that bad news?",
        "Bo: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Inez: What happened?",
        "Bo: My wife has lost her mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: This thing got any good games?",
        "Nora: All right, this is enough, Eddie. Just untie me.",
        "Eddie: Solitaire? Something?",
        "Nora: Okay, don't untie me, but can I at least speak to my husband?",
        "Eddie: Oh, good idea. So you can tell him where we are.",
        "Nora: So, I can tell him that I'm okay.",
        "Eddie: Oh, sweetheart...by the time we're through here, he's not going to care.",
        "Nora: What are you talking about? Of course he'll care. Oh, God. What little plan are you hatching in that pea brain of yours?",
        "Eddie: Honestly, is that even smart? Insulting the guy what grabbed you up? And while we're on the subject, this thing is useless. No pictures, no games-- nothing!",
        "Nora: Eddie--",
        "Eddie: What?",
        "Nora: Why won't my husband care that I'm missing?",
        "Eddie: Well, I don't know. Maybe that little text you just sent him might dampen his enthusiasm for you.",
        "Nora: What are you talking about? I didn't send a text. Is that what you've been doing? You've been texting him from my phone?",
        "Eddie: Now, that's using your pea brain.",
        "Nora: What did you send him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: What happened to Nora?",
        "Bo: She's pretty ticked off at me.",
        "Inez: You two had another fight?",
        "Bo: Yeah. And I said something that I shouldn't have said. She took off.",
        "Inez: But where did she go?",
        "Bo: I don't know. And I don't know when she's coming back. And she won't give me a chance to make things right.",
        "Inez: This is my fault.",
        "Bo: No, no.",
        "Inez: It is. Yes. Nora doesn't trust me and you're always having to defend me and it's an impossible situation. And I'm--I should go.",
        "Bo: Where are you going?",
        "Inez: I don't think that she would appreciate you talking to me like this. Your marriage is none of my business.",
        "Bo: But the fight we had...it was about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: There was a fight on Cole's cell block and he got dragged into it.",
        "Natalie: Great. One more thing Marty can blame on me.",
        "John: I made a couple calls and I got Cole transferred to another cell block. I think she just wanted to thank me so she got me something.",
        "Natalie: She did.",
        "John: Mm-hmm. Hey, look, for what it's worth, she's trying, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: I hope you're right. So what did she get you?",
        "John: You'll have to ask her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I was all ready to give this to John--let him see that the baby Natalie's carrying is Brody's and not his. But when I looked at his face, I... he's done so much for us--for us, I just couldn't do it. Not that Natalie doesn't deserve to be exposed and ruined. But I--I couldn't be the one to take away John's baby. I couldn't do it. I couldn't tell him. Not after everything he's--everything he's done for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, then, good luck.",
        "Kelly: It's going to take more than luck. I need some advice from the male perspective.",
        "Rex: Men like to hear it straight out, okay? Don't beat around the bush. We're easily confused. Just lay it out there. Joey may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but even he's smart enough to know what's good for him. You're one in a million, Kelly. He's lucky to get another chance with you.",
        "Kelly: Really?",
        "Rex: What are you afraid of? The competition? Please, you'll blow him away. Why would he waste his time with somebody else when he's already got you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Joey, I--oh, I don't know what to say.",
        "Joey: Say yes.",
        "Clint: I think what the young lady is trying to say, Joey--if I may--is this is a little sudden. I'm sorry--Aubrey...",
        "Aubrey: Wentworth.",
        "Clint: That's a very nice name. Aubrey may need some time to get her bearings, so why don't you slow down a minute.",
        "Joey: I don't want to waste another second. I love you, and I want to marry you and have kids and a home and a life together.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, listen to me. Those are all wonderful things, but you've obviously taken Aubrey completely by surprise. It might be too soon to have that conversation.",
        "Clint: We just met the young lady and she just met us. We need a chance to get to know each other, Joey. And at that business meeting in London about a month ago, you never even mentioned Aubrey.",
        "Joey: Well, I hadn't met her yet.",
        "Viki: You've only known each other--",
        "Joey: For a couple of weeks. What does it matter how long we've known each other? I love her, she loves me. She's going to make a great Buchanan.",
        "Viki: I have no doubt about that, but, darling--",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Viki: Honey, it's too fast--for Aubrey. For all of us.",
        "Joey: You know, I expected this from Dad, but from you, Mom, I thought I could count on you.",
        "Viki: Oh, Joey...",
        "Joey: Maybe your troubles with Charlie has just made you cynical about love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm. Stop!",
        "Echo: I'm so--I'm--I'm sorry. I just--ah--it's the--that effect you have on me.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, it can't happen again.",
        "Echo: Why not? Charlie, why not? I mean, we had a good run back in the day.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. It was different back then. I was different--",
        "Echo: I know, I was different, too. I was lost and confused and I was desperate, but I know what I want now. Chuckles, I want you. I want another chance. I mean, we could have had a family back then. We can still have a family now. Just--just tell me that that's what you want, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Whoo, whoo, whoo-- where's the fire?",
        "Dorian: Hello, darling. I'm sorry. I can't stop and chat. I'm on a mission.",
        "Kelly: Now what?",
        "Dorian: I have to save my friend Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Your mother's issues with Charlie, whatever they may be, have nothing to do with you and this young lady, who, I'm afraid, you have put on the spot. Aubrey, this is not the first time that Joey has put the cart before the horse.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, don't you think this was a bit rash?",
        "Joey: You're right. It was rash. Rash to assume that you'd be happy for us, that you'd welcome Aubrey in to the family the way she deserves.",
        "Viki: Oh, Joey, for heaven's sakes...",
        "Joey: No, Aubrey, I want to apologize for my parents. I thought they'd be a little bit more understanding.",
        "Clint: We have been plenty understanding, Joey.",
        "Joey: I wanted to share this moment--to share our love--because I love them. And despite how cold they are right now...",
        "Viki: Joey...",
        "Joey: They really are wonderful people. And I promise you, you're going to love them as much as I do. Make me happy and say yes.",
        "Aubrey: I can't do that, Joey. I'm sorry. I have to say no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Echo--no, please! Now, we both know that you have had too much to drink. So why don't you just head up to your room before you say something that you're going to regret tomorrow?",
        "Echo: I have had a lot regrets in my life, Chuckles. I have, but kissing you just then--that was the best thing I've done in a long time. You have to admit that you don't regret it, either.",
        "Charlie: Well, you're wrong!",
        "Echo: But you kissed me back.",
        "Charlie: Because you kind of caught me off-guard. I...",
        "Echo: Well, you took your sweet time coming to your senses.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm sorry.",
        "Echo: No, you're not. That kiss meant just as much to you as it did to me. Anyone with eyes can see that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I take it this isn't good news.",
        "Dorian: Well, it shouldn't happen to anyone. I can't say anymore about it, except it does involve Charlie and that sleaze Echo.",
        "Kelly: I'm not looking for any more details, but I am wondering why you seem so happy with this bad news you can't wait to run over and tell Viki about.",
        "Dorian: If your relationship were on the rocks, wouldn't you want to know about it? But then of course, you would have to have a relationship.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Okay. Let's not go there, Dorian, unless you want me to remind you of your own recent history. I'm just saying...",
        "Dorian: Well, I'll just say this. I had a lot of fun in the past, and I'll have a lot of fun again.",
        "Kelly: And so will I--if I have anything to say about it, because I am about to win back my very first love.",
        "Dorian: Joe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: You're turning me down?",
        "Aubrey: Don't misunderstand me, please. I love you.",
        "Joey: And I love you, too. That's why I want to marry you.",
        "Aubrey: But not like this, Joey. Your parents are right. It's just--it's just a little too soon. Let's enjoy what we're feeling about each other. It's wonderful. Why spoil that by rushing things? I have to get to know your family and friends.",
        "Joey: You will. And I want to meet yours, but we have the rest of our lives to get to know one another.",
        "Aubrey: And I'm sure some people do it that way, and maybe they even get their \"happily ever after,\" but--",
        "Joey: I thought that's what made us different. We trusted our instincts. We were not afraid to make a leap of faith.",
        "Aubrey: I know, but it's not just us, Joey. I can't do this to your parents.",
        "Viki: You know what? We're going to let you two talk this over, okay?",
        "Aubrey: No, it's okay, Mrs. Banks. Spend some time with Joey. After all, we do have the rest of our lives to be together.",
        "Clint: Smart girl.",
        "Joey: She's amazing. And now, thanks to you, I think I just lost her.",
        "Viki: Oh, Joey, for heaven's sakes, you haven't lost anything. If anything, you've discovered you are dating a very thoughtful young woman.",
        "Clint: Before you marry someone, you should check them out thoroughly. Trust me, I ought to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Eddie, tell me what you wrote to him.",
        "Eddie: Maybe. You going to be nice to me?",
        "Nora: I think I've been pretty nice to you so far, don't you? Hmm?",
        "Eddie: Okay, fine. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: No, I'm going to find Nora and I'm going to talk to her, but...just in case you run into her before I do, I think you better be prepared. She has this crazy idea that you're interested in me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: \"Bo\"-I'm you now, right? \"I am still furious over what you said last night.\"",
        "Nora: I would never write something like that.",
        "Eddie: You want me to keep reading? \"I honestly don't know if I can ever forgive you, but it seems like you still have some forgiving to do, too. It's hard to accept that after all this time, we still have\"-wait for it--\"Sam Rappaport between us.\" Ha ha ha ha! Oh, that's some kinky right there, girlfriend.",
        "Nora: How did you hear about him?",
        "Eddie: I have my ways. \"I thought you had gotten over him. How else could you have married me otherwise? But now I'm not so sure. And how can we stay married if this is the way you feel?\" Ha ha. You want to hear the rest of it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: \"What's it going to take to heal your wounded pride? Do you have to do to me what I did to you? Sleep with someone else and even the score?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: \"I'm going away for a few days. Please don't try to find me. I need time and space to figure out how I feel. And apparently, so do you.\" So what do you think? Did I capture your essence?",
        "Nora: Why would you write a message like that? What do you want to do, break us up? And why? You can't possibly believe that you've got a shot with me.",
        "Eddie: Hey, listen, I want a piece of tail, lady, all I got to do is whistle.",
        "Nora: Okay, then what is all this? And how did you know about the fight that Bo and I had? The only people who knew about that were Bo and Viki. Inez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I knew that you and Nora were having your disagreements, you know, like every other couple, but I had no idea that it was getting this serious. And I should have gotten another job.",
        "Bo: No, it's not your fault. Look, it's me. I got mad that she implied that I would cheat on her. And I didn't realize how hurt she was. And then she got this crazy idea...anyway, I should have nipped it in the bud, but now I don't know where she is.",
        "Inez: She'll be home soon.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but this--it's not her. None of this. Picking a fight over the phone? No. And she doesn't cut and run. I--I just--I don't know. None of this is her.",
        "Inez: Maybe it wasn't her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I'm going to go find Aubrey.",
        "Viki: Oh...",
        "Clint: Joey, no, no. Leave her be. If she wanted to talk to you, she would have stayed.",
        "Joey: I think I know my girlfriend a little bit better than you do.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, I certainly hope so, but you know something? I barely found out her name before you popped the question.",
        "Joey: What do you want to know?",
        "Clint: Are you--anything. I mean, her favorite color, her favorite food. Does she have any hobbies?",
        "Joey: Cerise. Not pink, not rose, cerise. Paella--hold the mussels. She rides western.",
        "Viki: Oh, she rides?",
        "Joey: Of course she rides.",
        "Viki: Well, that's wonderful. That's something you can share.",
        "Joey: We can share everything. She's perfect for me. I mean, you can learn a lot about a person in just a couple of weeks.",
        "Viki: But, honey, don't you think it's better if you get to know someone first?",
        "Joey: Trust me, I know more about Aubrey than Dad knew about Kim when he married her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Joe just got back in town. And I had no idea you still had feelings for him.",
        "Kelly: Well, neither did I until you pointed out I didn't have a love life.",
        "Dorian: Well, I did not mean--",
        "Kelly: No, no, no. You were right. And I started to think about why, and I realized I had never gotten over Joey. I still love him.",
        "Dorian: Why not? He's a very special man.",
        "Kelly: Do you still have feelings?",
        "Dorian: No. Oh, absolutely not, though he will always have a place in my heart. If you love him, darling, you have my blessing.",
        "Kelly: Do you mean that?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. Absolutely. I want you to be happy. And he is single.",
        "Kelly: Free as a bird--just like me.",
        "Dorian: Well, then, you go, girl. Ha ha ha.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: You're welcome. Now, I really do have to go and deal with this Viki-- tell you what, though. I will pull Viki aside so that I don't interfere with any of your plans. Okay, gorgeous?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You don't know the first thing about Kimberly.",
        "Joey: I know she made you happy, and that's good enough for me. Why can't you extend me the same respect?",
        "Clint: Because frankly, you don't deserve it.",
        "Joey: What are you talking about?",
        "Clint: This sudden proposal? Joey, it's just more of the same old same old. You're all heart and to hell with the consequences.",
        "Viki: Clint, I don't think it's fair to make those kinds of judgments.",
        "Joey: Thank you.",
        "Viki: On the other hand, I agree--it was very, very premature. You caught that poor girl completely off-guard.",
        "Clint: And look what happened with Kelly and Jen Rappaport. Both of those marriages didn't work. Why? Because you rushed into it. Marriage is a sacred institution.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's an admirable sentiment. What a pity so many people don't share it with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Are you really going to tell me that you didn't just feel something?",
        "Charlie: Well, of course I did feel something, but I didn't feel what you felt. Look, Echo, come on. I care for you, but I'm in love with my wife, and only my wife. And if you want something more out of me, then I'm sorry. I can't give it to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why can't you tell me what Marty got you?",
        "John: Well, I'd tell you if I knew.",
        "Natalie: I don't understand.",
        "John: Well, she gave me a present, and then I guess she thought better of it, and she took it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All right, Marty. What are you hiding and where are you hiding it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: How could this text not be from Nora? It was sent from her phone.",
        "Clint: I got Eddie out of your life. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the bargain and sleep with Bo.",
        "Inez: Unless she lost her phone.",
        "Bo: And then someone found it who knew that we had a fight and then they decided to text me?",
        "Inez: No. That doesn't make any sense. You're right. I guess, you know, sometimes, if you push someone enough, she'll do something you never expect.",
        "Bo: Well, then maybe it's time to return the favor.",
        "Inez: What are you doing?",
        "Bo: I'm going to do something that she doesn't expect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I want an answer, Eddie. Did Inez put you up to this?",
        "Eddie: Me taking marching orders from Inez? Oh, that's choice.",
        "Nora: Well, I know she's got a thing for Bo. I just never thought she'd take it this far.",
        "Eddie: Well, then you don't know Inez very well. She's an evil genius, that one.",
        "Nora: Well, I know you didn't do this on your own, 'cause...so who else would want to see Bo and me split up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: This is private, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Yes, a celebration of the return of my favorite Buchanan. Ha ha ha. What a joy, having Joe back home again.",
        "Clint: Don't get any ideas.",
        "Dorian: Joe and I are just good friends.",
        "Joey: Exactly.",
        "Dorian: Besides, I doubt he's going to be on the market for much longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I will have a glass of champagne.",
        "Kelly: Hey, you.",
        "Aubrey: Kelly, hi.",
        "Kelly: What are you celebrating?",
        "Aubrey: I told you I was meeting the parents.",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Aubrey: Well, it took a very surprising turn.",
        "Kelly: Good, I hope.",

        "Kelly: Well, I decided not to go with a dress.",
        "Aubrey: You didn't need it. Once he sees you again, he's going to wonder how he ever let you go. And once you finally tell him how you feel, he's going to pick you up into his arms and thank you for making the first move. I guarantee it.",
        "Kelly: Oh, I hope so.",

        "Echo: Oh, it wasn't just the alcohol.",
        "Charlie: No, Echo, you have had a rough couple of months. Okay? This town has not been very kind to you. And I'm not surprised that you would want to reach out to someone--you know, someone you trust.",

We should be\"-oh--\"talking this through, not texting potshots. And to blame this on Inez --well, that's just paranoia.\" Oh, yes, you did drop the \"P\" bomb right on us. \"Come home. Fix this with me. I can't do it alone.\" That's it. No \"Love, Bo\" or nothing. I'm sorry. Looks like the Bo meister here just threw you to the wolves.",

I don't even know what I'm looking for, forget where. Yes, I've tried under the bed. And the desk. Trust me, I've looked everywhere a normal person would hide something. Although Marty hasn't been herself these days. Sorry? No, no, I found something. Yes, she's a mess. Listen, think about if, you know, we lost Shane--if he were sent away. No, I know he never would, but I'm just saying... yeah, we'd always wonder if he'd be the same--would he be okay? Gige, I got to call you back.",
