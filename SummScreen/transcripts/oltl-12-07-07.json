        "Blair: Todd, it is freezing out here. Let's -- let's go back inside before we catch a cold.",
        "Todd: You get sick from germs, not the cold.",

        "Gigi: Whoo! Wait till you see what I got you, you precious little boy.",
        "Marcie: Gigi and her surprises. Does she spoil us? She does, doesn't she? Look at that -- oh!",
        "Gigi: A cherry lollipop. That's okay, right? You let him have lollipops?",
        "Marcie: Uh -- yeah, yeah, sure. Just -- tomorrow because I brushed his teeth.",
        "Gigi: All right. Huh. I also brought bananas and sandwiches and lots of yummy pie samples.",
        "Marcie: Mmm -- look at all this food!",
        "Gigi: Nobody goes hungry during bake-off season.",
        "Marcie: Well, I promise that I will pay you back.",
        "Gigi: I told you, I don't want to be paid back. And besides, it won't be long before you're making your very own money now that I've snagged you a glamorous job waiting tables at the Bon-Jour.",
        "Marcie: Are you kidding me? Did you already talk to your boss about me?",
        "Gigi: Sure did, and it just so happened he had an opening.",
        "Marcie: Are you kidding? Oh, and he's going to take a chance on me? Really? Oh, my God -- that's amazing! Look at you -- you have some clout over there -- what?",
        "Gigi: Well, honey, after being hired and fired about 10 times by good old Moe, I finally cracked his hard-ass code.",
        "Marcie: Well, let's just hope I can crack it, right? So, can I start tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: There you go, sugar -- on the house. And don't you be shy to tell me what you think. The recipe is a work in progress.",
        "Moe: Why waste a gentleman's time with anything less than the finished product? Try this, buddy -- apricot raspberry, the chef's very own.",
        "Noelle: The man's already got a slice of pie, Moe.",
        "Charlie: Well, Michael, it looks like you've met the welcome wagon.",
        "Noelle: Charlie, welcome back!",
        "Charlie: Noelle, Moe. Meet my new friend, Michael McBain.",
        "Noelle: Pleased to meet you, Michael.",
        "Moe: Welcome to the Bon-Jour.",
        "Michael: It's good to be here. Thank you for the pie.",
        "Moe: On the house -- your dinner, too. Any friend of Charlie's.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, so where's Viki? Is she not working tonight?",
        "Noelle: Well, I guess you don't know.",
        "Moe: She's gone, Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know what I am? I'm a firm believer in the power of conviction, and I believe in miracles because I've lived through too many not to.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I believe in miracles, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Miles sighs]",
        "Miles: They were so close, she and Cole. He was everything to her and now he's all alone.",
        "Natalie: Oh, honey, Marty had a lot of friends. They're going to take care of him.",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Mom.",
        "Viki: I'm home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: We're having a very difficult day here. So whatever you came here for --",
        "Nora: I'm looking for Cole. Is he here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, get back! John, you, too -- get back! I'm not kidding -- get back!",
        "John: Okay, okay. I'm back.",
        "Cole: So that's what happened, huh? You shot the tire out from the van, caused us to go over the edge? The reason why my mom is dead --",
        "John: Cole? Put the gun down.",
        "Ramsey: Put down the weapon, son.",
        "Cole: What'd you just call me? \"Son?\" It's because of you I'm no one's son.",
        "John: Just do it, Cole. Put the --",
        "Cole: Step back!",
        "John: Put the gun down.",
        "Cole: He killed my mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Cole is in mourning. And if you want to offer your condolences, I suggest you call -- by telephone, tomorrow.",
        "Nora: I'm not waiting until tomorrow. The boy's lost his mother and I need to speak to him now. Do you understand? Cole, are you there?",
        "Dorian: You stay right where you are, Nora.",
        "[David chuckles]",
        "David: Hey, look at you with the cane. Doing a one-woman show? I'll get you a top hat, some tap shoes -- you'll be packing them in at Llanview Rep. But obviously, I'm interrupting.",
        "Nora: Dorian, let me in now.",
        "Dorian: No!",
        "Nora: Cole?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely no way are you getting in this house -- you understand me? And understand this, David -- it's not a fashion accessory. I need it. I sprained my ankle in Texas.",
        "David: You? You were always so light on your feet.",
        "Dorian: I was hit by a car, driven by an unknown assailant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hi, baby. Sunshine, how are you?",
        "Jessica: Um -- so, you heard?",
        "Viki: Yes, darling. That's why I came home.",
        "Jessica: Marty's -- was such a good person and a wonderful mother and -- well, now Cole -- he has no one.",
        "Viki: I think he's going to find out how many friends he and Marty had.",
        "Jessica: Thank God you're home.",
        "Natalie: We really missed you.",
        "Viki: Oh, I've missed you, too. Nash, good to see you.",
        "Nash: You don't know how good it is to see you, Viki.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Miles? I am so, so sorry.",
        "Miles: Thanks. I heard it on the news, I came right over. I'm trying to call the state department, but the switchboard's closed. We -- we can't let Cole be responsible for having to bring Marty's body back.",
        "Viki: Doesn't -- doesn't Marty have any other relative who could do that?",
        "Jessica: Um -- well, she had an aunt, but she passed away a couple of years ago, so, no, Marty has no family.",
        "Viki: There's just Cole?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Put down the gun, son, before you hurt yourself.",
        "John: Come on, Cole, give me the gun.",
        "Cole: No. I want to hear everything he has to say, everything he did to my mom.",
        "Ramsey: If you don't put down that weapon --",
        "Cole: Shut up! Shut up! You killed my mom, you bastard! And you're going to tell me why. And you're going to beg me to give you the chance at she didn't get! Do you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You're leaving me?",
        "Todd: You don't have to get all worked up about it. You can have your $5 million. I don't care about the money. Kids can stay with you. I don't -- it's -- that's what I want. I'll have my lawyer call your lawyer and work something out. Good?",
        "Blair: No, Todd, far from it.",
        "Todd: Blair, I don't want to hurt you anymore. I've hurt you long enough, let's just end it. Besides, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm tired and I'd like to go home.",
        "Blair: You are home. And if you leave without me getting my say, I'm going to pull a page from Margaret Cochran, and I'm going to shoot both of your kneecaps off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You got hit by a car? When?",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake.",
        "Dorian: Right after we parted ways in Texas. Yes. It was hit and run. I was left for dead like so much Texas road kill.",
        "Nora: Really? Sort of like what you did years ago to a pregnant Jessica? Do you even know where Cole is, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: And I suppose you put that poisonous reminder right in Clint's ear! You just live to destroy other people's happiness. You have been desperate to find a way to break me and Clint up, and now you've seized your opportunity!",
        "Nora: You know what? You're absolutely right. I did want you and Clint broken up -- you know why? Because you're a selfish, miserable person and he deserves better -- there! You win! Now, where is Cole?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I can't believe that Viki's gone. Did she say where she was going?",
        "Moe: All she said was, is she had to go home.",
        "Noelle: Wherever that is.",
        "Moe: She said someone close to her died.",
        "Charlie: Did she say who?",
        "Noelle: Nope. It's too bad you weren't here -- she could've used the shoulder.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, I had some business I had to attend to. I wish I had been here.",
        "Noelle: Well, you going to stick around now?",
        "Charlie: I don't know.",
        "Michael: I'm sorry -- maybe you guys can help me. I'm looking for my wife and son, and according to Charlie, they may have been here in Paris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You want to start tonight?",
        "Marcie: Well, um, only if you're not working and can watch Tommy, which I will pay you what I can.",
        "Gigi: Uh-uh -- I just didn't expect you to be so gung ho. I mean, you sure weren't excited about waitressing when I first suggested it.",
        "Marcie: Well, that -- look. I got two options, right? I can either be a homeless, single mom on the run with no money, or I can put together a getaway fund at the Bon-Jour and risk being recognized.",
        "Gigi: Well, you're a lot more likely to get recognized begging with a baby than you are waiting tables.",
        "Marcie: Exactly.",
        "Gigi: Do you hear that, Tommy? Hmm? Your mommy's going to be working soon, and you are not going to mind one bit because Aunt Gigi and Shane are going to look after you. And when I'm working, there's my friend Lonnie. She watches Shane -- I'm sure she would be tickled to death to baby-sit Tommy.",
        "Marcie: Really?",
        "Gigi: Everything is going to work out -- because you and I have a plan now.",
        "Marcie: Hmm. Well, let's just hope the plan works, because it's the only plan we got.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't you talk to me about Margaret tonight.",
        "Blair: Oh -- I'm glad. I got your attention here. Well, let me tell you something. You're not to utter another word about divorce in this house with your children lurking around everywhere.",
        "Todd: They're going to have to hear about it sometime.",
        "Blair: You know, Todd, take all the time that you need to deal with this thing with -- with Marty. But I'm not going to let you just cast aside the people that love you -- your family!",
        "Todd: I wreck lives, Blair. It's what I do. My children need to be protected from me.",
        "Blair: Your children -- do Starr and Jack look wrecked to you? Do they? Did you see Starr's face when we walked through the door at Thanksgiving? We were home, you were home. And then Jack -- he was crazy to see you when we got him off the plane. Todd, why can't you see that you're loved and wanted?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Why'd you kill my mom?",
        "Ramsey: You and your mother were taken by terrorists, not me.",
        "Cole: You shot the tires out on the van, you caused the crash.",
        "Ramsey: You were on borrowed time from the moment you were taken. No matter what kind of deal John thought he was going to make, you were never going to be allowed to live. You could've identified all of your abductors.",
        "Cole: So you were trying to save us by shooting at us?",
        "Ramsey: At a tire. My job is the greater good, son.",
        "[Cole scoffs]",
        "John: Shut up, Ramsey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, what'll happen to Cole?",
        "Viki: I'm sure that Marty had some kind of plan in mind.",
        "Miles: She told me -- um -- when we were friends that she needed to write a will or designate a guardian, but she -- she hadn't done it because she couldn't even think about leaving Cole behind all alone.",
        "Jessica: Well --",
        "Viki: Wow.",
        "Jessica: Cole might not have a family, but he's sure going to have a network.",
        "Viki: Oh, yes, darling. He's going to have so much love and support.",
        "Jessica: Well, he stayed with Nora when Marty was in jail. Maybe -- maybe she can take him in again.",
        "Viki: I'm sure that Nora will open her home to him and her heart, and of course, we'll do anything we can to help him.",
        "Natalie: Maybe we should plan a service.",
        "Viki: Yes, and if -- if Cole wants it, we -- we can plan that, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Okay. I'll -- I'll get in touch with Cole and I'll make the arrangements. Do you want to help me?",
        "Miles: Oh, um -- no. I think -- I think you should get someone else, someone that knew Marty, what she really cared about. You know, it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be me.",
        "Natalie: John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Damn it, John.",
        "Cole: Why'd you do that?",
        "John: This guy can't open his mouth without giving you a reason to shoot him. So I'm going to tell you why you can't.",
        "Cole: I'm not your kid -- you can't tell me anything.",
        "John: That's funny -- I was under the impression that you and I were friends. So what do you say you give me that damn gun and let's get the hell out of here?",
        "Cole: My mom would be alive if it wasn't for him!",
        "John: Hey, you want to throw your whole life away over this piece of -- this piece of crap?",
        "Cole: My life doesn't matter anymore.",
        "John: You know better than that.",
        "Cole: Don't tell me what I know. Both my parents are dead. Somebody has to pay.",
        "John: Doesn't work that way, Cole.",
        "Cole: My mom -- she could never catch a break, you know? I mean, she had horrible things happen to her her whole life.",
        "John: I know. But, you know, when she talked about you, she was happy. It made her happy. You made -- you made it all worth it for her.",
        "Cole: \"Worth it\"? Worth it? How is it worth it for her? She's dead! The funny thing is all the people that hurt her are still alive and she's not, so I'm going to fix that. I'm going to make it fair.",
        "John: Li-- listen to me, okay? There's nothing fair about this life. Your mom would tell you the same thing.",
        "Cole: How do you know what she would tell me? You think you know her better than I did?",
        "John: No -- no. You knew her better than anyone. You loved her, more than anyone, but I also know there's a part of her in you! And that means you got to be just as good as her. That's what she would've wanted.",
        "Cole: Well, you know what? She's not around anymore, right? So I'm going to do what I want.",
        "John: Killing him won't bring her back.",
        "Cole: It'll make things even, won't it? Say that was Spencer right there, and you had the chance to kill him. Wouldn't you want to do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Yes, I'm right, and yes, I win. You have been trying to poison my relationship with Clint because you want him all to yourself.",
        "Nora: You know what? You don't deserve to hear this, but maybe if you do, it'll shut you up. Clint -- God help him -- is crazy about you, crazy about you, Dorian. And you know what? You blew it, by betraying him and hopping into bed with that! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have come to take Cole home with me!",
        "Dorian: Oh, no! No, no, no -- after insulting me like that?",
        "Nora: Can you think about someone else besides yourself for just a nanosecond?",
        "Dorian: My family is going to tell Cole he is welcome to live with us, so your services are not required.",
        "Nora: Do you not even have a heart? Do you not have a heart? Can't you see I'm grieving for my friend? My friend. All I want to do is take Cole home with me, okay? And that's what I'm going to do. Now, where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What's it going to take for you to leave this alone?",
        "Blair: Well, I'm never going to stop fighting for my children's happiness, the life that they deserve and you are part of that.",
        "Todd: They'd be happier without me.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. How would you know that, Todd? Are you here when they're without you? No, you're not! I am, and they're far from happy.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: You know, it's going to be hard for this whole family to deal with what happened with Marty, but we will deal with it as a family. Believe us when we say that we love you and accept it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You're no better than Spencer Truman, are you?",
        "John: Truman deserved worse than he got. Dying was too good for him.",
        "Cole: No, John, you're wrong! That's exactly what he deserved! Ramsey, are you scared? Are you as scared as my mom was right before she died? Huh?",
        "John: Cole, listen to me. Killing Ramsey will make you feel good for about two seconds, but after that, you're screwed for life, forever. Is that what you want?",
        "Cole: John, you said --",
        "John: Is that what your mom wanted for you?",
        "Cole: Listen to me! If that was Spencer right there in front of you, and you had one chance to put things right for your family, for your dad, wouldn't you do it?",
        "John: I had that chance, Cole. But I had someone that cared about me enough to stop me, and you have that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: At the risk of speaking without being spoken to, who died?",
        "Nora: Marty. Marty Saybrooke died. She's dead.",
        "David: Oh, my God.",
        "Nora: Can we please just be civilized about this? I just want Cole. I want to pick him up and take him home with me.",
        "Dorian: He's not here.",
        "Nora: You're lying.",
        "Dorian: He went for a walk.",
        "Nora: Alone? Or did Starr go with him?",
        "Dorian: She wanted to, but he said he preferred to be alone.",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake, that's the last thing he should be right now.",
        "Dorian: And when he returns, we're going to make it clear to him that he's most welcome to stay with our family. He feels most comfortable --",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Dorian: With Starr, and he should not be separated from her.",
        "Nora: No. No, when his mother went to jail, she asked me to have Cole live with me at the Buchanan house, and that's what's going to happen this time because those are her wishes. So I am going to get Cole and take him home with me.",
        "Dorian: I am not going to turn that boy over to you.",
        "Nora: Why bother with either one of you? I'll find him myself.",
        "Dorian: He asked to be left alone, Nora. Aren't you going to respect his wishes?",
        "Nora: He is a teenage boy who just lost his mother! He needs to be comforted and cared for, and not wandering God knows where all by himself.",
        "Dorian: Oh, why did I even bother to open the door?",
        "David: Wait -- what happened to Marty?",
        "Dorian: Something that shouldn't have happened to her -- or anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: Now that I think about it, a couple came through here right before Thanksgiving also looking for a woman and a baby.",
        "Michael: This couple -- can you describe them?",
        "Moe: He was loudmouthed and pushy.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I think we talked to the same guy.",
        "Moe: His wife -- she was nicer. Real pretty, shoulder-length hair, tall.",
        "Michael: And they were looking for a woman and a baby, right?",
        "Moe: They left some flier.",
        "Charlie: Yeah -- now, the woman on that flier is Michael's wife.",
        "Noelle: And you think that couple was looking for your wife and baby?",
        "Michael: Yeah, that's what I think. Are you and Charlie the only ones to have talked to this couple?",
        "Moe: No. They talked to Gigi, too.",
        "Noelle: Gigi's one of the other waitresses who works here.",
        "Moe: \"Works\"? I'm not sure that's the word I'd use.",
        "Noelle: Now, you stop, Moe. Sure, Gigi has to take time off sometimes to look after her Shane -- that's her little boy -- but that girl brings in a whole lot of business.",
        "Michael: Where can I find her, this Gigi? I want to know what the couple said to her.",
        "Noelle: Well, I could give you Gigi's address. The trouble is, she's practically clear across town. Oh, wait.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Noelle: Gigi's got this new friend we've never met. I'm pretty sure she said the woman has a kid.",
        "Michael: Well, what else did she say about her?",
        "Noelle: Well, she doesn't talk about her much anymore, but she's always taking food out for her and the baby. Far as I can tell, the woman never comes out of her room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Smile, you two.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Marcie: Oh, that's going to be a great one. So, did you tell your boss that I'm a total klutz? Because you know, the last time I waitressed, it was not pretty.",
        "Gigi: Oh, well, by the time I get through with coaching you, you'll be able to carry four plates in each arm, and give Moe an earful of grief all at the same time.",
        "Marcie: Wow. Hey, did you hear that? Huh? Mommy's going to have a paycheck coming in soon.",
        "Gigi: Well, you know what? Don't expect it to be all a barrel of laughs, because when it gets busy at the Bon-Jour, it gets really hectic, okay? Moe starts getting cranky, and then customers start ragging on you.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: Look, I was an English teacher in a former life, all right? Sophomores, 7:00 a.m. I'm more worried about being recognized.",
        "Gigi: I keep telling you, Todd Manning thinks you're in South America. Thanks to me, he's totally off your trail. And hopefully, so is everyone else.",
        "Todd: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Blair: Oh, okay. Then help me understand, Todd. What do you want me to tell the two children in there that love you unconditionally, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: They might love me now. They'll get over it. They'll grow older and they'll stop loving me. They'll -- they'll be sick of me. They'll be embarrassed by me. I don't want that for them.",
        "Blair: Starr already knows what happened with Marty and she forgave you. Both of your children love you like crazy. Now, I see that you could do this two different ways, Todd. First one is maybe take the easy way out. Walk away from yourself, walk away from your children. Or you can do something I think maybe might be a little bit tougher for you, and that might be to own up to the man that you've become.",
        "Todd: I don't know who that is.",
        "Blair: Well, I do. He's a man that never gives up on his family. He is a man that makes his children laugh. You're their hero, Todd. And you're the husband I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Can't believe Marty's gone. Guess that means her son's all alone, huh?",
        "Dorian: There are two orphans living under this roof.",
        "David: Two?",
        "Dorian: Langston. Starr's B.F.F. Oh -- I'm going to be her foster mother.",
        "David: Sheesh. If you start climbing every mountain, I'm out of here.",
        "Dorian: David -- only you could make me laugh on a night like this. So what brings you here? I thought we said our goodbyes in Texas.",
        "David: Well, I had to see you. I wanted to wait on you, hand and foot.",
        "David: Mm-hmm. Or is it that you had no place else left to go after Alex left you high and dry?",
        "David: Well, yeah, there was that, too. And I was really worried about you when you took off into the night like that after your tiff with Clint.",
        "Dorian: \"Tiff\"? Oh, why don't we just call it what it is? A breakup. It's over. Finito, finis.",
        "David: Dorian, if you love Clint -- God knows why -- you should fight for him.",
        "Dorian: What? No, no, no, no. I tried. No. No, it's over.",
        "David: The Dorian I know --",
        "Dorian: I know -- would have put up a better fight. But you know -- huh -- thanks for the support, but it's all over between Clint and me. Too much was said and done.",
        "David: So now you're going to figure out a way to nail him, huh?",
        "Dorian: Ooh, how little you think of me.",
        "David: What are you talking about? I drove all over Texas looking for you. I even went to that diner.",
        "Dorian: The Bon-Jour Cafe?",
        "David: And you will never guess what I found there.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: You know, Michael, the flier that I saw was at that motel, and then somebody took it down.",
        "Michael: I'm going over there.",
        "Noelle: Oh, that's where Gigi always visits her friend -- at the Bon-Suites -- but we sure as heck have never seen her.",
        "Michael: And that's all you know?",
        "Noelle: That's it. Oh, don't get your hopes up. It's probably not your wife and kid.",
        "Michael: What room is she in, the friend? You know?",
        "Noelle: I think Gigi said she's staying right down the hall from Viki. That's one of the other waitresses here. Try Room 102.",
        "Michael: All right, thanks.",
        "Moe: Hey -- you didn't try the pie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: So, do you think Moe will let me start tonight?",
        "Gigi: Well, I don't know about tonight. I mean, I just got off and it was pretty slow. Why don't you come over tomorrow bright and early and help with the morning rush? I'll get Lonnie to watch Tommy. She'll be thrilled.",
        "Marcie: She's reliable, though, right? I mean, if anybody comes over and starts asking questions --",
        "Gigi: Oh, God, are you kidding me? She'll grab her husband's rifle and chase them off the porch.",
        "Marcie: She has a gun?",
        "Gigi: No, I just -- I just meant that she would never let anything happen to a kid in her care.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Oh, okay, okay.",
        "Gigi: Just try and relax, okay?",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Gigi: Okay. Because this is your last night of freedom. You might as well enjoy it.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",

        "Nash: Glad to have your mom back?",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Nash: Feeling better?",
        "Jessica: I just want to go home and hold Bree and promise her that I'll never, ever, ever, ever leave her. But I can't promise her that, now, can?",
        "[Nash sighs]",
        "Nash: You know, it is times like this that make us remember that we can never take each other for granted. All right?",
        "Jessica: We need to write a will.",
        "Nash: We'll write a will.",
        "Jessica: Well, I understand why Marty didn't, but the worst part about me being sick was the thought of Bree going on without me. But I always knew that I had you, and you were healthy, and it never dawned on me that something could happen to you, too.",
        "Nash: What our daughter has is an extended family. And they will fight like hell for her.",
        "Jessica: I know. But still, I want it to be very clear. I want it to be written in stone -- exactly what we want for her and who we want her to live with.",
        "Nash: Okay, we will do that.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Nash: We will write a will, okay?",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Nash: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I just can't believe Cole doesn't have anyone.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, I'm sure Marty's other friends will look out for him.",
        "Jessica: Oh -- well, Nora's out trying to find him right now, and -- well, he can stay with us, even if he needs to, you know --",
        "Nash: Yes, he most certainly could do that.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. But still, Marty didn't write it down legally, what she wanted to happen with him, so anything could happen to him. I mean, he could end up a ward of the state.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: It was nice of you to offer to plan the service.",
        "Natalie: Oh, honey, a woman's died. A -- a young mother that -- she had so much to live for. You know, just because she and John were together -- I mean, that's -- it means nothing now. I wonder how he's feeling tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Thank you, Bo. Yes, if I learn anything else, I will let you know. Well, it's good to talk to you, too. I wish it were under better circumstances. Thanks, bye.",
        "Jessica: What did Bo say?",
        "Viki: He has been briefed by the state department. Apparently, Marty was caught up in some sort of an explosion.",
        "Natalie: Oh --",
        "Miles: Explosion?",
        "Viki: Uh -- gosh, I don't even know how to say this. They said there is no body to bring back.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You're not responsible for me, John. No one is, all right? I'm -- I'm on my own. I have to live with myself, and as long as this guy is around, I can't deal with that.",
        "John: Your mom didn't raise you to be like this. Neither did your dad. You told me he hated guns.",
        "Cole: You know, if my dad hated guns a little less, maybe he'd still be alive!",
        "John: You don't believe that, Cole. Your dad was a man of principle. And your mother had so much compassion in her heart. You demean her memory by being like this.",
        "Cole: Her memory? What does that mean? Her memory -- I -- I can't see her, I can't talk to her! She can't wait for me to come home at night. And what -- what is that -- you act like her memory is some kind of substitute for the real thing. It's not! Doesn't mean anything!",
        "John: It's all we have.",
        "Cole: It's nothing! My mom got pushed around her whole life! And now she's not here to push back, so I'm going to do it for her!",
        "Ramsey: Son, you -- you don't know how to shoot that.",
        "Cole: You want to bet?",
        "[Cole cocks gun]",
        "Cole: You know, John told me what my mom's last words were. So now, Ramsey, I want to hear yours.",
        "John: You want to shoot him, Cole? You have to shoot me first.",

        "Dorian: And what in that wannabe French bistro could possibly be of interest to me?",
        "David: That bouillabaisse recipe you were lusting after.",
        "Dorian: Incroyable!",
        "[David laughs]",
        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "[Speaking French]",
        "Dorian: How did you get it?",
        "David: I snatched it from the chef's cookbook when I was doing dishes.",
        "Dorian: Pardon?",
        "David: For the record, I'm no longer a stranger to hard labor.",
        "Dorian: You were actually working in that dump?",
        "David: Well, I stopped there to have breakfast on my way back to Llanview. I got caught skipping out on the check. I was saving my last dollar to come back here and see you -- make sure you're okay.",
        "Dorian: And to see if possibly there was room at the inn?",
        "David: Well, now that you mention it -- are you all booked up?",
        "Dorian: You're in luck. We happen to have a vacancy. A very large room, overlooking the pool with a fireplace and a king-sized bed.",
        "David: I could use some company, especially in the king-sized bed.",
        "Dorian: Oh. What was I thinking? I never could've made it work with Clint. I need someone who is passionate, impetuous, unpredictable.",
        "David: You're forgetting incredibly attractive and highly motivated.",
        "Dorian: That wouldn't hurt. I need someone like you. Or just you.",

        "Natalie: I should have gone after him.",
        "Viki: Darling, he wanted to be alone.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but how does he know what he wants? He's probably feeling guilty about what he did to Marty.",
        "Viki: Come, come.",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Viki: I think that Miles is very lucky to have someone as loyal to him as you are.",
        "Natalie: You have no idea how good it is to have you back.",
        "Viki: Oh, thank you.",
        "Nash: Well, maybe I can get you something. It must be, what, 3:00 A.M. in Paris.",
        "Viki: No, I'm fine. No, I have everything I need right here. Darling, you look very, very well. Thank you for looking after her so well. Thank you. And how's Bree? I can't wait to see her.",
        "Jessica: Oh, she's wonderful. She's talking up a storm. She's calling Dad \"Papa.\"",
        "Viki: Oh. I've missed her. I've missed all of you, terribly.",
        "Jessica: Oh, we missed you, too. And I know now's not the right time, but I want to hear all about Paris.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Yes, I -- I have a feeling that the emails we got did not do it justice.",
        "Viki: Definitely not, no.",
        "Charlie's voice: This doesn't mean that what we have has to end. I -- I'm not expected to move in with my son, you know. What -- what I mean is --",
        "Viki: Don't, don't, okay? Don't say any more, please. Can we just appreciate what we have? Live it one day at a time?",
        "Charlie: Huh. That's -- that's how I'm learning to live my life now.",
        "Viki: Is it working?",
        "Charlie: Well, so far.",
        "Viki: Hey -- look what I found. Shall we?",
        "Charlie: Well, it couldn't hurt. Okay. Make a wish. Ugh!",

        "Noelle: Hey, maybe you should give her a ring. You've got her phone number, right?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I do, but I think I'll hold off. I mean, she's most probably got a lot to deal with and doesn't need to be pestered by me.",
        "Noelle: Pestered? Are you kidding? I have a feeling Viki'd be real happy to hear your voice, Charlie. Now, what do I know? I'm terminally single, I can't win a bake-off to save my life, and I probably just sent your friend Michael off on some wild-goose chase. Well, but that's me. I always get these things wrong.",

        "Blair: I know exactly what I meant. This time when we got married, we may have gotten married for different reasons, but the vows I took, I meant. They were real. I love you, Todd. I always have and always will.",
