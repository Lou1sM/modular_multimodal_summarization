        "Ross escapes from jail, goes to the Seattle hospital, and holds a gun on Todd, Tea, and the cops and tells them he won't let them prevent him from taking his daughter with him. He takes Dani down to the parking garage and is determined to leave with her. Right then, he runs into Blair who is looking for Todd. She seems to know what he is doing. So he takes her hostage with Dani. Back in Llanview, Fish and Kyle are happily together when Fish gets a call from John. Kyle gets a call from Marty to inform them that Nick has been assaulted by gay bashers. Kyle rushes to see Nick and knows it was because of Nick's courage to come out. Fish realizes that he could never do what Nick has done and has feared that very thing. So he concludes that maybe Kyle is more suited for Nick than for him."
