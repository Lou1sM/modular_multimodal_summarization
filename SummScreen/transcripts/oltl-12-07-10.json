        "Gigi: Mr. Vega is going to be a little delayed, so he asked me to get class started for him today. Joel, right?",
        "Joel: Right. And you're Didi?",
        "Gigi: Gigi. So I'm gonna pose you, but this time, could you please, um -- yeah. Keep your clothes on till I'm done.",
        "Joel: Sorry.",
        "Langston: Huh. Whoa. Now I know why they had to add an extra section of this class.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: Today's model.",
        "Starr: Yeah. He's naked. From what I hear, they're always naked. Oh --",
        "Langston: What are you looking for?",
        "Starr: James -- he's supposed to be here by now. Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You like that one, Pop, huh? You want some more? You want some more, Pop? You like that? And the next time you come around, I'll be ready!",
        "Eddie: Ready? Hmm. Looks like maybe I should have stayed away a little longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I hope nothing happened to make James miss class.",
        "Langston: Like what?",
        "Starr: I don't know. The last I heard, his dad left town, but there's no guarantee that -- Lang?",
        "Langston: Sorry. Um -- you're worried that James' dad might come back or something?",
        "Starr: Well, yeah, after what happened at Thanksgiving, yeah.",
        "Langston: I thought you said you didn't want to get sucked into any of James' problems. You know, maybe I should change spots or something.",
        "Starr: How's that no sex thing working out for you?",
        "Langston: Good. Really -- good.",
        "Starr: Right.",
        "Langston: No. I'm -- I'm fine, really. Ford's the one who's suffering. He's probably already feeling -- deprived.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Can you believe it? I meet Joey's parents for the first time, and 30 seconds later, he decides to propose. Right in front of them. Yeah, they freaked out. Who wouldn't? So I left him alone with them to talk.",
        "Ford: Aubrey. Is that you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Hey. What did you want to talk -- oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you asking me to marry you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dorian, just say what you have to say. I mean, if this is not a state secret, tell me.",
        "Dorian: I saw them. Charlie was kissing Echo.",
        "Viki: N-no. No. No, I'm sorry. No, I -- I can't even picture that. I don't know what you saw, but obviously, you are mistaken.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: As long as there is no repeat performance, I won't tell Viki that we kissed. There's no need for her to know. That'll be our secret. Okay?",
        "Brody: What? Who's keeping secrets in here?",
        "Echo: Ooh! Ah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: \"The DNA matches with Brody Lovett.\" What?",
        "[Door unlocking]",
        "Marty: Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Everything okay?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, everything's fine. Echo was just feeling a little under the weather.",
        "Echo: Oh, ha! What he means is that I'm blotto. Uh, hammered? Too many mimosas. So Charlie here was just promising that he wasn't going to rat me out.",
        "Brody: So that's the secret you were talking about?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, right, right.",
        "Echo: But I think I'm just gonna go upstairs and lie -- woo!",
        "Charlie: Come on, let's, uh, why don't I just walk you up to your room?",
        "Echo: Such wonderful gentlemen. How did I get so lucky?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Come on.",
        "Brody: Yes.",
        "Echo: Ooh, thanks. Easy. I've got this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Viki, I know what I saw. Your Charlie was kissing Echo.",
        "Viki: Oh. I -- I don't get this. Why is the mayor of Llanview running around town spying on people?",
        "Dorian: Because the sooner you know the truth and face it, the sooner you can put an end to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Joey, I -- I can't believe it. After all this time, for you to be waiting --",
        "Joey: What? Oh, Kelly, no, no.",
        "Kelly: No?",
        "Joey: I would never -- I mean, after all these years?",
        "Kelly: Right. Right.",
        "Joey: You didn't come down here thinking that I was going to propose to you? Oh, God. Talk about a misunderstanding \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Venice film festival, right?",
        "Ford: 2008.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah. I didn't really see anything I liked that year -- except for you.",
        "Ford: Yeah, I kind of thought we had something going there until you blew me off.",
        "Aubrey: You weren't exactly honest with me, as I recall.",
        "Ford: But I've changed a lot since then. I'm a new man.",
        "Aubrey: Huh. Sure you are -- Bobby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What we're going for here is ancient Greek warrior, so pretend this is a spear and show me what you got.",
        "Langston: Who goes to war naked?",
        "Starr: You're so gonna cave on this abstinence thing.",
        "Langston: I am not. And neither is Ford.",
        "Starr: 6 months? I can't believe you got him to agree to 6 hours.",
        "Langston: Me, neither. But he did, so I have to stick to my -- ahh. Okay, seriously, though, how hot is this guy?",
        "Starr: He's okay.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry, just okay? Are you coming down with something? You feeling okay?",
        "Starr: Actually, I think you're the one with the fever.",
        "Langston: Hey, look, I know that you don't want to get involved with James while Cole's in jail. I get that. But that doesn't mean you can't even look at another guy. Come on, Starr, you're only human.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: So you didn't just disappear like we had hoped.",
        "Eddie: No.",
        "James: Well, we thought you'd take the money and run. So what the hell happened?",
        "Eddie: I got a job.",
        "James: A job?",
        "Eddie: Yeah. Freelance.",
        "James: Freelancing what?",
        "Eddie: Well, it's sort of a consultancy thing, actually. Mostly part time. So anyway, I thought I'd come down here, check up on my kid, you know, see how he's spending his time.",
        "James: Oh, 'cause you care about me so much?",
        "Eddie: When did you get into boxing? That is so cool.",
        "James: Oh, you know what? Let's just put it this way. You never know when a little self-defense is gonna come in handy.",
        "Eddie: Ah. So thanks to your father is what you're saying.",
        "James: I don't want to be taken by surprise anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: No, I would never just spring something like that on you.",
        "Kelly: Right. Right, of course.",
        "Joey: You and I, we're good friends now. Anything else that happened between us was all in the past, happened a long time ago. I mean, come on, it's not like I'm delusional.",
        "Kelly: Me, either. Why would I assume -- that would be delusional, wouldn't it? It's just that that looks like an engagement ring.",
        "Joey: It is an engagement ring. For someone else.",
        "Kelly: I guess since you said that you wanted to see me, I had this -- momentary insane flash that, um -- obviously, that is ridiculous.",
        "Joey: Ha. Obviously.",
        "Kelly: So you're really getting married?",
        "Joey: That's what I wanted to tell you. I mean, is it that big of a surprise?",
        "Kelly: Pretty big. Especially after what Kevin said when I was in London.",
        "Joey: What did he say?",
        "Kelly: He just -- mentioned you weren't seeing anybody, so -- how can you be getting married?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: So -- how long you been in town?",
        "Aubrey: Not long.",
        "Ford: You like it here?",
        "Aubrey: What's not to like?",
        "Ford: Well, I don't know, it's kind of a small place. Doesn't seem like your usual kind of scene.",
        "Aubrey: Well, maybe my scene is changing.",
        "Ford: Yeah? Why is that?",
        "Aubrey: I met someone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I met someone while I was traveling. Total surprise. Just hanging out in the south of Spain, taking pictures, and one night, there she was.",
        "Kelly: I'm not about to hear the words \"love at first sight,\" am I?",
        "Joey: Aw, I know it sounds cheesy, but what can I say? I saw her, and I knew, and I thought, you know, why waste time? Let's just do this!",
        "Kelly: Yeah, you've always been very impulsive. I used to like that.",
        "Joey: I cannot wait for you to meet her, Kel. She's -- oh, she's really special.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: He is a very special guy, and Llanview is his hometown, so I'm here to meet the family.",
        "Ford: Sound serious.",
        "Aubrey: I guess I've changed -- the way you say you have.",
        "Ford: Hey, it's the truth. I'm not the same player that I was in Venice.",
        "Aubrey: Who is she?",
        "Ford: Who?",
        "Aubrey: The woman that's brought about this big transformation. What's her secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Any questions?",
        "Starr: Yeah, Langston would like his number.",
        "Langston: Starr!",
        "Starr: I'm kidding. Oh.",
        "Langston: Forget it, Starr. If James hasn't shown up by now, he's not coming.",
        "Starr: I just don't know what would make him miss class.",
        "Langston: You're right. It's not like him. Well, you want to try giving him a call, make sure he's okay?",
        "Starr: No, I can't.",
        "Langston: Why not?",
        "Starr: I can't because then by calling him, I'd be leading him on, and I need to stop doing that.",
        "Langston: You're thinking about what Marty said, aren't you?",
        "Starr: I have never seen her like that, Langston. She said that Cole would have never turned to Hannah if I hadn't have gotten so close to James.",
        "Langston: Okay, that is not fair, and it's not true, so don't listen to Marty. She's starting to sound like she could be just as crazy as your dad says she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Marty: A-anyone there?",
        "Marty: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: How many mimosas does it take to get that wasted?",
        "Charlie: Well, Echo has always had a weakness for champagne, but you know, she never let it get to her like this before. I'm not making excuses for her, but she's had a pretty rough time lately.",
        "Brody: Everything with Rex, right? I mean, it's great, but it's a lot to handle for all of you.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Yeah, she's carrying around a lot of guilt about leaving Rex years ago, and guilt can make you do some pretty crazy things.",
        "Brody: Right. And you probably don't need anybody else weighing in on this, so I should keep my mouth shut.",
        "Charlie: What? No, it's okay. I mean, you're a friend. Heck, you're family as far as I'm concerned. What, you got something to say, just say it.",
        "Brody: I'm just wondering if having Echo here in the house -- is that really the best thing for you and Viki?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, I'm not about to go home and confront Charlie over something I didn't even see.",
        "Dorian: You don't have to confront him, just ask him.",
        "Viki: No, no. I'm not going to do that",
        "Dorian: You don't need to be accusatory. You can be very casual about it. \"Oh, darling, did you happen to be kissing Echo?\" Eh. And then if he is the man you say he is, if he is honest and true, he will admit it, and then you can get busy and get that woman out of your house!",
        "Viki: Okay, okay, fine, fine. Fine, I'll ask him! God, you're irritating.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: You're gonna love her. I know it. I would have told you earlier except I wanted to tell my parents first.",
        "Kelly: Oh, yeah, well, that makes sense.",
        "Joey: That's what I thought until they completely freaked.",
        "Kelly: Your parents freaked?",
        "Joey: Yeah. I thought it was gonna be champagne toast, and instead I got, \"You two hardly know each other, blah blah.\" That's why the ring is here instead of on her finger.",
        "Kelly: I see.",
        "Joey: Now, if you had been here, like a good wingman, you would have been happy for me and they would have relaxed and it would have gone in a whole new direction.",
        "Kelly: Maybe.",
        "Joey: Maybe?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I kind of see their point, Joey. I mean, you and this woman, you haven't known each other that long. Look, maybe it is too soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Seriously, who is this girl, and what sexy moves does she have that the rest of us don't?",
        "Ford: Well, actually, the sex part is actually non-existent for the moment.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, it's good to know you haven't lost your sense of humor.",
        "Ford: No, I'm being serious.",
        "Aubrey: It was so nice to see you again, Ford.",
        "Ford: You, too. And I hope things work out for you and the new guy.",
        "Aubrey: I intend to make sure they will. Wish me luck.",
        "Ford: Good luck.",
        "Aubrey: Mmm.",
        "Ford: Huh. All right.",
        "Dorian: And what the hell was going on here? That's what I'd like to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, God. Um, ahem. Is it hot in here or is that just me?",
        "Starr: Focus.",
        "Langston: Sorry.",
        "Ford: Are you sure you don't want to have sex with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: Don't look now, kid, but I think the bag may be winning.",
        "James: Don't you have something better to be doing?",
        "Eddie: Sure! But it's like a train wreck, you know. You hate to stare, but somehow -- ha ha -- you just can't look away.",
        "James: Okay, all right, you think you could do much better?",
        "Eddie: In my sleep, baby, in my sleep.",
        "James: Okay, great.",
        "Eddie: I tell you what, why don't you and me go a couple rounds. I'll give you some pointers. Hmm?",
        "James: No, thanks.",
        "Eddie: Oh, come on, Jimmy, what did I do? Did I embarrass you the other day in front of your little girlfriend Starr? Well, here's your chance to make it up, okay? We can settle this up like men, huh? Come on, I got you. Right here. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, God.",
        "Starr: Lang, what's wrong with you?",
        "Langston: You know what? Maybe I made a mistake. 3 months would probably accomplish the same thing.",
        "Gigi: Change.",
        "Langston: Oh.",
        "Langston: Stop doing that.",
        "Starr: I'm not doing anything.",
        "Langston: Not you.",
        "Ford: Check out the goods, Langston. You sure you can wait 6 months?",
        "[Thud]",
        "Gigi: Okay, what is going on? Is there a problem here? What is this?",
        "Langston: You know what? This is your fault.",
        "Gigi: My fault?",
        "Langston: Yeah. You're the one who came up with the insane \"no sex\" idea.",
        "Gigi: Excuse me?",
        "Langston: I'm sorry. I overheard you and Rex talking, but you said it worked, right? Please, I have to know for sure.",
        "Rex: Sorry, excuse me. Coming through. Not looking. Okay, Gige, I need you, now.",
        "Langston: I guess it worked.",
        "Gigi: Rex, I'm supervising a class. You can't just --",
        "Rex: I know. I'm sorry to interrupt, but you've got to see this.",
        "Gigi: What is it?",
        "Rex: Marty has the original. I took a picture of it. I just finished printing it out. Do you see that? It says that Brody is the father of Natalie's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Look, Brody, um, you know, Echo has had a very lonely life, and now that she's got a son and a grandson, she really wants to get to know them better, and if she's living here, it's so much easier for her to do that, and I think that Viki understands that.",
        "Brody: It can't be easy, though.",
        "Charlie: No, it's not, but nobody's got a bigger heart than Viki. You know that.",
        "Brody: You guys have been through so much and you've never given up on each other. That's the kind of marriage that I want with Jessica.",
        "Charlie: Takes a lot of work. You know something, it's worth it.",
        "Viki: Oh. Brody, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. Charlie, could I talk to you for a moment, please, privately?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Well, that is a shock. I never thought you'd take my parents' side in this.",
        "Kelly: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I am on your side, which is why I think you owe it to yourself to make sure you want to spend the rest of your life with a woman you literally just met.",
        "Joey: It doesn't take months or years to know someone. Sometimes it's there and it's right and you can feel it. And if you knew her, you'd back me up. She's -- she's so great. She's --",
        "Kelly: Aubrey?",
        "Aubrey: Hi.",
        "Joey: Wait a minute. You two know each other?",
        "Aubrey: Yes. This is the girl I was telling you about that I met on the plane.",
        "Joey: Unbelievable!",
        "Aubrey: But how do you two know each other?",
        "Joey: Kelly and I -- we used to be together, but we're still best friends.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, my God. So --",
        "Kelly: Holy cow! This is the boyfriend you were talking about all the way from London. That is so great.",
        "Joey: I'll say. Nothing I wanted more than my fianc\u00e9e and my best friend to get along, and they're already best buds.",
        "Aubrey: Well, technically, I'm not your fianc\u00e9e yet.",
        "Joey: Well, we can fix that. Just say the word and I'll put it on.",
        "Kelly: I should leave the two of you alone.",
        "Joey: No, no, no. Kelly, stay. Just really feels right having you here. And plus I need a good wingman. Somebody needs to help me convince this gorgeous creature here to marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: All right, I don't have time for this. I've got a meeting with the chair of my department that I'm already late for.",
        "Dorian: Yes, you're late because you were pawing that blonde.",
        "Ford: I was talking to somebody I used to know.",
        "Dorian: Used to know or used to have sex with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How horrible is this?",
        "Gigi: Uh, it's definitely horrible. It's very, very horrible, which is why we probably shouldn't talk about it out here. Uh, thanks for coming, everybody. Class dismissed.",
        "Joel: Could you hold my pole for a second?",
        "Langston: Okay, that's it. I got to get out of here.",
        "Starr: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: Okay, let's go.",
        "James: Find yourself another punching bag. I'm busy.",
        "Eddie: Well, never turn down an opportunity to learn, son. Besides, you can make the big bad dad pay for all those times he gave you a little boo-boo when mommy wasn't around to kiss it and make it all better.",
        "James: Don't you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?",
        "Eddie: Never. So come on, what do you say? I'll start you off with a freebie, wide open, buddy boy! Give it your best shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Lang, did you see this?",
        "Langston: What, kickboxing?",
        "Starr: Yeah, the first class is free, and it starts tonight.",
        "Langston: You gonna take it?",
        "Starr: I don't know. I was thinking about it. I could have used some techniques to use against Eli and Hannah.",
        "Langston: Well, I really liked the class I took last year.",
        "Starr: Well, then maybe you should come with me and work off some of that energy.",
        "Langston: Good idea. Where's it at?",

Boom! Like that, huh? That's what I'm talking about. Boom! Come on, baby. Now come on. Come on, don't let up. Uh-uh. Uh! Ooh!",

        "Rex: I mean, I just don't understand. Where the hell did Marty get this?",
        "Gigi: I -- I don't know.",
        "Rex: When Todd hired me to investigate Marty, he just went on about how dangerous and crazy she was. I just thought it was his usual paranoid crap, but -- now I'm starting to wonder.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: I took the job because, hey, it's a job. I didn't expect to actually find anything, especially nothing bad enough to show that Marty can't be around her own grandkid, but if she paid somebody to fake test results --",
        "Gigi: That's -- that's really hard to imagine.",
        "Rex: But that has to be what happened because you know and I know that Brody is not the father of Natalie's baby. They never even slept together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I told Jessica I'd be right back. She's probably wondering what happened to me, so I'll see you guys later.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Yeah. Oh, how was lunch with Joey?",
        "Viki: Oh, eventful, yes.",
        "Charlie: Good. Well, is that what you wanted to talk to me about?",
        "Viki: Yeah, later, later. Right now, I need to talk to you about Echo, okay? What happened when you brought her home, please?",
        "Charlie: Nothing much. I was just trying to sober her up, and she was in pretty rough shape, so I took -- Brody and I took her upstairs to try to get her to bed to sleep it off, you know.",
        "Viki: That's it? Nothing else?",

Ahem. \"We have reviewed your case that has been pending with the Llanview -- in light of your years of distinguished service -- blah blah blah -- you will remain on staff but are placed on probation until further notice.\" Well, at least I still have my job. That's all I have.",

        "Gigi: I know. What was she going to do with this?",
        "Rex: Now, you said she went off on Natalie, right? Blaming her for Cole going to prison. Maybe this is revenge or something. But if the results are fake, how would that even work? The only way she could hurt Natalie would be if these results were real, and they can't be. Can they? Ow!",
        "Gigi: You should really talk to your sister about this.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, I don't want to get Natalie all freaked out.",
        "Gigi: If Marty is up to something, Natalie should know about it, right?",

There's a big hole in our lives without Cole, and because of that, we really need to be there for each other. It would really help me to see Hope right now, Starr. It really would help me. I miss her more than I can say. So I'm just praying that you've done something about that -- the restraining order.",

        "Ford: Your daughter doesn't tolerate lame excuses, either. She's a strong person, and I like that. I admire that.",
        "Dorian: Really? And is this newfound respect for her as a result of the recent moratorium?",
        "Ford: Mora -- moratorium?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. Her moratorium on sex, as in none. Yes. Yes, we Cramers believe in full disclosure.",
        "Ford: Uh-huh. I get that.",
        "Dorian: My daughter believes that this will help reform you. I believe it will just push you into the arms of another woman.",

        "Viki: She saw you two kissing.",
        "Charlie: What, do you have Dorian spying on us?",
        "Viki: No! Of course I'm not. Dorian took it into her own head to follow you. Just tell me, is it true?",

        "Dorian: Oh, really? So while we're throwing around promises, I'll make you this promise: You hurt my daughter, and I'm gonna hurt you.",

        "Viki: But you were not gonna tell me.",
        "Charlie: No. If it didn't mean anything --",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie, of course it meant something. It meant that Echo thinks there's absolutely nothing wrong with kissing someone else's husband!",
        "Charlie: No, but she was mortified when it happened. She was scared.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I'll bet she was. Of what?",

        "Charlie: Okay, no -- it has nothing to do with me! I just happened to be here. Look, Viki, please, if you throw her out of here, you're gonna be punishing Rex and Shane for something that is not their fault.",
        "Viki: Oh, oh, I see, I see. Your very ex-girlfriend throws herself at you, and I'm supposed to take the high road? How would you like it if I moved Clint in here and started kissing him?",
        "Charlie: Viki -- this was just a one-time thing.",
