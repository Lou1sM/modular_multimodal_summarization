        "Jessica is taken to a secret location and Reg tries to get it on with her but she fights him. Another arrives and Jessica runs to him thinking that he will save her from Reg. It turns out that the man is the man that Tess ripped off when she first met Nash. They are going to force her to have a threesome. She plays the game like Tess would and asks for a drink first. Reg runs to the car and gets a bottle of vodka that he was saving for just such an occasion. While he is gone, Jessica purposefully spills the other man's drink on his clothes to get his attention away from her. She then turns her back on him and sends Antonio a text message. 'Taino' Antonio knows this means that Jessica is in danger and he and Nash swing into action. They track her to the shed where Reg and his friend have let her stall enough. Nash and Antonio enter the building and knock the men out. Reg isn't completely out and so when Antonio's back is turned, he makes a swing at Antonio's head with a two by four. Jessica is there and whacks the psycho before he can harm even a hair on Antonio's head. \"I don't know about the both of you, but I really need a drink!\" she says. Vincent comes to the hospital. He notices Natalie ring is gone, and thinks this has to do with the kiss they shared. She isn't worried about that. She leaves the area and John calls to Vincent. \"I know that you have feeling for Natalie, but I am back now.\" Vincent leaves the room knowing that he might not be able to stay away from Natalie. The van transporting Spencer comes to a sudden stop. There must be something wrong with the road the guards check things out and try to start driving again. The window on the passenger side breaks and a masked man pushes a gun in the window at the guards ordering them to keep still. He overpowers them and drags them out of the van one by one and drops them face down and motionless on the ground. Spencer goes back to the van now and drags the cuffed Truman out of the vehicle and to his knees beside the two guards. This is when Spencer recognizes the masked man's voice. At this point, the masked man really doesn't care. \"Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! Jingle All The Way! Oh what it will be to make Spencer Truman pay!\" Todd is driving fast, with his head out the window, feeling the wind in his hair and singing the carol with his own brand of Christmas spirit blended in. He is happy and it shows by the maniacal smile on his face. Spencer struggles to get the hell out of the back seat, but Todd has him in there good. \"I don't hear you talking about you 'mommy' anymore.\" All Spencer does in response is chuckle like the sane Spencer Todd knows. \"Where are we going?\" Spencer asks. \" We are going to the scene of the crime \""

        "Jessica: Let go! So help me --",
        "Reg: So help you what? What, you'll beat me up?",
        "Jessica: Get your hands off of me.",
        "Reg: I remember you used to tell me some of your favorite games. What do we call this one? Big, scary bad guy, terrified Tess?",
        "Jessica: I am not Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Ahem.",
        "Antonio: Oh, hey. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Nash: No, not at all. Family photo album. It's a work in progress, I hope.",
        "Antonio: Some cute pictures of Bree.",
        "Nash: Yeah she's a doll.",
        "Antonio: The -- the one of Tess kind of caught me off-guard.",
        "Nash: Yeah, it's funny. I only seem to have one photo of Bree and Tess together.",
        "Antonio: You saving it for Bree?",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm. Unless, of course, you'd prefer that Bree didn't know Tess ever existed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey, yourself. How you feeling? John peachy. How do I look?",
        "Natalie: Handsome, even with all the bandages.",
        "John: Oh, you like the mummy thing, huh?",
        "Natalie: Oh, absolutely. Actually, I spoke with your surgeon, and he said that your second set of skin grafts went very well, so congrats.",
        "Nurse: Hello? How's our patient feeling this evening?",
        "Natalie: Oh, he says peachy.",
        "Nurse: Good. I'm going to apply some mineral oil to the graft site. It shouldn't take long.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Hey, I'm going to be right outside. I promised Michael and Marcie I'd tell them when you woke up.",
        "Vincent: Natalie, Natalie -- you know, we really need to stop meeting like this.",
        "Natalie: Yes, we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: This is so exciting! I have a boyfriend who can pick locks.",
        "Rex: It's the Balsom D.N.A.",
        "Adriana: Rex, what if --",
        "Rex: We get caught?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Are you sure this is worth the risk?",
        "Rex: You know I can't let anybody find out that Marcie and Michael have Todd's son. Tommy belongs with them. They're good parents, and I will do whatever it takes to protect the little guy. It's going to be all right. You're my lookout, right?",
        "Adriana: Yes. I will knock once if someone's coming, twice if they're trying to get in. So if I knock twice --",
        "Rex: I hide. Got it.",
        "Adriana: And three times if it's all clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Another one of your headaches?",
        "Blair: Yes. Just a little one. But I'm worried about Todd.",
        "Dorian: Right, right. We are here because we're waiting to find out if your brain tumor has reoccurred.",
        "Blair: I didn't tell you that.",
        "Dorian: You didn't need to. I'm a doctor, and I know your past medical history, and you should be taking care of yourself and let that poor excuse of a human being take care of himself.",
        "Blair: That poor excuse for a human being happens to be the father of my children and the man that I love, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Right. Yes, yes, yes. So why don't you just let him run around out there, carry out his -- his vendetta against your other poor choice of a man?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, you know -- that's what I'm afraid of. My husband out there going after Spencer -- Dorian, let me out!",
        "Dorian: No --",
        "Blair: Todd could get hurt.",
        "Dorian: I am putting my foot down. I'm not going to allow you to put your health at risk any --",
        "Blair: Something could happen to Todd!",
        "Dorian: So what?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: So what? You heard me -- so what? If something happens to Todd, then those children of yours are going to need their mother more than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hey! What are you doing? Take it easy.",
        "Guard: What's all this about?",
        "Second guard: Think something strange?",
        "First guard: Probably just a tree down or an accident around the corner.",
        "Second guard: Let's check it out. Keep your eyes open and your weapon drawn.",
        "First guard: Wouldn't do it any other way, my friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Whew. Oh! Who are you? How did you get in here, and what have you done with my son?",
        "Matthew: Come on, dad.",
        "Bo: No, no, no. You may look like Matthew, but I know that I'd never walk in here and find him serving Wong Fu's mu shu pork, lo mein, and triple delight.",
        "Matthew: Only your real son would know your favorites.",
        "Bo: Ok. Maybe you are Matthew. Why the spread here?",
        "Matthew: Mom said you had a rough day, so I thought maybe I could cheer you up.",
        "Bo: Well, she's right. My day has not been great. Did she -- did she give you money for all this?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Bo: Ah. You didn't rob a convenience store? Oh, god -- I hate arresting my own kid.",
        "Matthew: Not all my allowance goes to video games. I've been saving up.",
        "Bo: Fine with me, all right. If this was your plan to help me salvage my rotten day, then I think you've done the right thing. All right. Here is to the ultimate family dinner.",
        "Matthew: The only thing that would make this better is if you had a wife here to share it with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How can you possibly think about helping that sociopath?",
        "Blair: Todd and I used to be a team, ok? There wasn't anything the two of us couldn't do together. And I want that back. I should be out there helping Todd!",
        "Dorian: Oh, right --",
        "Blair: Instead of waiting in here.",
        "Dorian: And where is Todd when you need him? He's out there playing vigilante, when -- when we're here waiting to find out whether or not your brain tumor has come back.",
        "Blair: What would Todd do if he were here anyway, huh?",
        "Dorian: If necessary, he could comfort you. Blair -- baby, it's all right to be scared.",
        "Blair: I just want my family back.",
        "Dorian: I understand. All right? But you have got to take care of yourself.",
        "Blair: And I am scared. But I need Todd.",
        "Adriana: Hey.",
        "Michael: Hey. How are you?",
        "Adriana: I -- good. I just heard the judge's ruling. I'm -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Well -- thank you for saying so. You know, the one thing that my family could use right now is -- whew -- a little closure.",
        "Adriana: I can't believe you actually came to work.",
        "Michael: And yourself? How are you? You feeling -- you feeling ok? What -- what are you doing here?",
        "Adriana: Rex is getting a follow-up on his gunshot wound.",
        "Michael: Oh. You know, I had assumed that you had come to see Blair.",
        "Adriana: Blair? What's wrong with Blair?",
        "Dorian: Blair is very, very sick. And she could use her family. That is, if you can stand being in the same room with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're really not very hungry, are you? Come sit down. You know, darling, just worrying doesn't help. Eat something.",
        "Starr: Doesn't look like you have much of an appetite, either.",
        "Viki: No, I guess I don't. I think that Spencer's trial and especially what happened today just has taken a lot out of everyone.",
        "Starr: Tell me about it. My family can't catch a break.",
        "Viki: No. Things have not gone well lately, have they?",
        "Starr: \"Lately\"? Don't you mean \"ever\"?",
        "Viki: No. No, Starr. And besides, your mom and dad are doing the best they can to fix things.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, with how things are going, I don't think that's going to be good enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hey, why are you stopping? Potty break?",
        "Guard: Shut the hell up. Thing. Let's get going before it's something.",
        "Todd: Don't move! Put your hand down. Put your hands on the steering wheel right now! All right, boys, I'm taking over from here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You have no idea what you're doing or who you're doing it to.",
        "Reg: And that makes it more exciting, huh? You told me you like to play games, and I am telling you, you're going to love this one.",
        "Man: What's going on?",
        "Jessica: Thank god. Please help me. This man is attacking me.",
        "Man: Dude, are you starting without me?",
        "Reg: I ought you'd be waiting here.",
        "Jessica: No, no. No, no. Please, I'm -- I'm not who you think I am.",
        "Man: I am truly upset. This is part of the game? Pretending like you don't remember me?",
        "Jessica: No, I don't remember you, I swear.",
        "Man: You swiped my credit card and bought champagne for everyone in the bar, remember? But when I found you down here, you paid me back -- with interest. Where you going, Tessy?",
        "Reg: Tonight, you're going to get two for the price of one.",
        "Jessica: You morons think that's supposed to make me hot?",
        "Man: There's nobody who needs to make you hot, babe.",
        "Reg: You're as hot they get.",
        "Jessica: Well, I can make you both scalding hot if I had a drink first.",
        "Reg: Vodka, right?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, good memory. Let's hit a bar.",
        "Reg: We don't need to go to a bar. I got a bottle in car just for this occasion.",
        "Jessica: Ok, well, go get it. Let's get this party started.",
        "Reg: I'll be right back.",
        "Jessica: You know, one bottle between the three of us is barely going to get our juices flowing. But there is a liquor store about three blocks away.",
        "Man: I'm ready to party right now. It's gin, but it'll tide us over.",
        "Jessica: Goody. Oh. So do you take pictures of all your girls?",
        "Man: I've taken a shot or two.",
        "Jessica: Oh, let me see. Oh -- sorry. Here. Well, let me flip through your girls here, and you can just use my scarf over there to wipe that off. It smells like booze all the time anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Would it matter if I didn't want Bree to know that Tess was her mother?",
        "Nash: No, not really.",
        "Antonio: Look, I know that you and Jessica decided to tell her, so it's up to you two.",
        "Nash: Wow, it almost sounds like you're not going to fight me on this one.",
        "Antonio: This isn't a decision that's mine to make. This is about what's better for Bree, not me.",
        "Nash: What if Bree asks you first?",
        "Antonio: Well, I'll leave that up to you and Jessica. All right, you know? I mean, I can barely wrap my mind around it. I -- I don't know if I could figure out how to tell a little girl.",
        "Nash: The all-knowing Antonio doesn't have all the answers? Wow.",
        "[Phone beeps]",
        "Antonio: Oh, wait a second. I got a text. And by the way, I -- I never said I knew all the answers. I just hope that you guys know the answer to this one.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: \"Taino\"?",
        "Nash: What is it?",
        "Antonio: Jess is in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Can you turn on the TV before you go?",
        "Nurse: Very funny, Detective Mc Bain. Do I look that easy?",
        "John: Hmm. I just want to know the verdict in the case.",
        "Nurse: What you need to do is heal. Forget the news, and let that beautiful girlfriend of yours help you focus on recovery.",
        "John: Natalie will know what happened by now.",
        "Vincent: I hope you don't think that I came by here to check up on you. I came to give support to Hugh's adoptive parents, who came and flew in to claim the body and take it home to be buried.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Vincent. That must've been very hard for you.",
        "Vincent: Oh, it was. But it was harder for Paige, though.",
        "Natalie: Of course. And for the record, I -- I didn't think that you were following me. But I do feel that this friendship has to be put on hold.",
        "Vincent: Oh. So John's not as cool about this whole kiss thing as you thought?",
        "Natalie: It's not -- that's not it.",
        "Vincent: Then what happened?",
        "Natalie: It -- nothing. Nothing happened.",
        "Vincent: You're not wearing your engagement ring.",
        "Natalie: Ok, look, John's not the one with the problem, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My mom and dad are never going to get it together.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, don't do that. You've always had such faith and hope in your parents.",
        "Starr: But I'm not 10 years old anymore.",
        "Viki: Exactly. Now you are old enough to realize that true love really es persist.",
        "Starr: I would settle for them faking it for Jack's sake. Jack has done a complete 180. He's totally loving my dad, but he has no idea what's going on.",
        "Viki: You know, he might be a little more perceptive than you give him credit for.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? I used to think it was my mom's fault for forcing my dad out. I used to think that all the bad things that my dad did were for me and Jack. And then I find out that he raped Cole's mom? I always knew that, but I'm thinking now that -- now that I met her -- my mom was right for not believing my dad.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, don't do this. You sound like you hate your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What do you mean, Blair's sick? What's wrong with her?",
        "Michael: Well, you know, we're not exactly sure what's wrong with Blair yet.",
        "Dorian: The most important thing is they have -- they have to rule out the possible reoccurrence of her brain tumor.",
        "Adriana: Wha-- oh, my god! Hey, I just heard. How are you feeling?",
        "Blair: Well, I didn't want anybody to know until we knew something for sure. I'm sure it's nothing, sweetie, you know?",
        "Adriana: Well, you need support. And whatever the problem is, I -- if there's anything you need --",
        "Blair: You are doing it. You're doing it.",
        "Adriana: Ok.",
        "Blair: And it's nothing, ok? You know, if something does happen to occur, I'll let you know.",
        "Michael: Well, I -- I really hate to break this up, but I am the doctor, and I do have to examine my patient, so if you could give us a moment alone --",
        "Adriana: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Of course. Adriana?",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Thank you very much for putting our differences aside.",
        "Adriana: Do Starr and Jack know?",
        "Dorian: No, because we don't even know yet. So of course, they don't know. But if something were to happen to Blair, Todd will not be able to manage those children all by himself. We're going to have to help. So I suggest we have a cup of coffee together and talk about it.",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry. I'll do what I can to help Blair, but that's it.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "Blair: I can't be sick, Michael. My family needs me. Of course, there are other problems, all having to do with Spencer.",
        "Michael: Yeah. You know, if it was just me and Marcie, I'm pretty sure we could handle it, you know? But we have Tommy now. And there's going to come a day when Tommy asks why he doesn't have a grandfather. And I'm going to have to explain to him why the man who killed his grandfather is still walking around free.",
        "Blair: No, that's not going to happen. Spencer is never going to hurt another family again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hey, what are you doing? What do you want? What do you want? Oh, what the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: You should be married.",
        "Bo: Ahem -- where did that come from?",
        "Matthew: What? You don't want to get married again?",
        "Bo: No, I think -- what I think we have to do is cut down on the amount of time you spend with your grandpa Asa.",
        "Matthew: Grandpa just wants you to be happy. So do I.",
        "Bo: What, I'm not happy?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. Kind of. But you'd be a lot happier if you were married.",
        "Bo: Oh. And that'd do the trick, huh?",
        "Matthew: Look, you smile so much more when you're with Paige, and so does she. So have you ever thought about marrying Paige?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Mmm.",
        "Reg: What are you looking for?",
        "Jessica: The cops. [Jessica chuckles] I'm about one drunk and disorderly away from a visit to Statesville. So I got an idea. I know a bar just around the corner that has tons of people at it that like to party like it's 1999. The more, the merrier, right? So let's go.",
        "Man: We could have a merry -- pretty merry time all by ourselves.",
        "Reg: Yeah. Let's -- let's get this party started right here and right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Look, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We can't start talking about helping raise Blair's kids till we even know what's wrong with her.",
        "Dorian: There's nothing wrong with a family contingency plan.",
        "Adriana: We're not a team, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: It doesn't have to be this way, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Well, I don't see it changing anytime soon, if ever.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Michael: Excuse me. Ladies, is there a problem?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Michael: Nurse, I need you to draw enough blood for a full battery. You can talk to Dr. Pembrook. He'll give you the rest of the details.",
        "Nurse: Ok, doctor.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me.",
        "Michael: So --",
        "Adriana: Don't -- don't -- don't ask.",
        "Michael: Ok. Um -- whatever it is, I hope it gets better.",
        "Adriana: Thank you. [Adriana sighs]",
        "Rex: It sounded like you were holding a convention out here.",
        "Adriana: Did you get everything?",
        "Dorian: Oh, my. Be careful when you pull those papers out of your pants. That'd be a nasty spot for a paper cut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: So you're the one that's tripping off the fact that we kissed?",
        "Natalie: Look, Vincent, the man I love is lying there in that bed with most of his body burned. He just had his second skin-graft surgery today.",
        "Vincent: Natty, you thought he was dead when all of this happened.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Vincent: Then why are you beating yourself up about it?",
        "Natalie: Because that kiss was a big deal to me. You know what? You're right. I was wrecked. I wasn't eating. I was seeing things that weren't there, but --",
        "Vincent: Like John.",
        "Natalie: Yes, yes. And I was just so desperate. I mean, my heart was racing 24/7. It felt like I was going to have a heart attack every second of every day.",
        "Vincent: I know, Natalie. All right? Remember, I was there.",
        "Natalie: I was so messed up that I actually -- I -- the only person I could turn to was a complete stranger.",
        "Vincent: Uh-huh. So you're saying any old stray cat would have done?",
        "Natalie: Vincent, no. Ok? That's -- that's not what I'm saying. I mean, you -- you were there for me, you listened to me, you supported me, and you told me the truth when it mattered the most -- that John was alive, and you have no idea how grateful I am for that -- for everything.",
        "Vincent: You're welcome.",
        "Natalie: It's just tomorrow, I have to tell John what happened at Spencer's trial.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. It's going to be heavy.",
        "Natalie: I'm just afraid that it's -- it's going to set back his recovery somehow. And that's a risk I'm just going to have to take because -- well, John needs to know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hell, what are you doing, Todd? You think don't know it's you? I'm an idiot? I recognize your voice. What -- what'd you do to them? That good -- a couple more homicides on your record? Everything's going to point to you, Manning. Everything's going to point to you --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't want to do anything that's going to jeopardize his recovery.",
        "Vincent: I don't see how any of this will make a difference. But you know what? It's your call. And I respect your decision.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Vincent: But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop caring about you, Natalie. And if you need anything -- and I mean anything --",
        "Natalie: Ok, I got it. You know, I' got to -- I got to go call Michael and let him know -- um --",
        "Vincent: Hey, do it. Do your thing.",

        "Starr: I don't hate my dad. How could you say something like that?",
        "Viki: Honey, listen to yourself. Listen to what you're saying. And you know something? Your father thinks that, too. He thinks you hate him. You know, darling, I know how really difficult and tough your father has been on the boys that you like. So I can only imagine how you must feel about what happened with Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Starr: He told you about everything?",
        "Viki: He's my brother, darling. He has to talk to somebody.",
        "Starr: I -- I always knew what he had done. But it was something that happened a really long time ago. That's the way I always looked at it, that it was just some anonymous name, but it's not that anymore. It's an actual person. I can't believe that my dad could do something like that, that he would even be capable of that. And I hate myself for still loving him.",

        "Todd: Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way oh, what fun that it will be to make Spencer Truman pay hey! Merry Christmas, everybody. Ha-ha-ha! Oh, merry Christmas, Spencer. I love to drive.",
        "Spencer: I always knew you were full of it, Manning. But I never thought you'd be full of the Christmas spirit. Where are we going? Where are you taking me?",
        "Todd: Well, don't you worry. Wingdale is still on the itinerary. Just got to make a little pit stop first. But you're going to go back to the nut house, that's for sure. Just when and in how many pieces, I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Hey, John.",

        "John: You got the verdict in the Truman case?",
        "Vincent: I'm sorry, man, I haven't been keeping up.",

        "Rex: Ok. Ok. You got me. I was out of printer paper. I just didn't budget for it this month.",
        "Dorian: Uh-huh. It looked as if you were stealing records from the file storage room. And it looked as if it was a team effort. It's a good thing no one saw you.",
        "Adriana: Dorian --",
        "Rex: Do not give this gift back. We can check the price tag later.",
        "Dorian: Hmm?",

        "Rex: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: I'm just saying it might be a possibility. Is there any way you could be pregnant?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Nurse: You don't sound so sure. Headaches and nausea can certainly be symptoms of pregnancy.",
        "Blair: Well, now that you mention, I guess there could be a possibility. I could be pregnant.",

        "Reg: My car's right around the corner.",

        "Antonio: All right, let's try and be cool, because we don't know who or what we're dealing with.",
        "Jessica: Come on, you guys, you're blowing it.",
        "Nash: That clear things up?",
        "Man: You're really playing this to the hilt, aren't you? I like that.",

        "Nash: Put down the board.",
        "Antonio: You know, but you might not want to mess with him. He's not quite right in the mind. Will -- come on.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Ahem. Let me be honest with you, ok? Yes, I have thought about marrying Paige. It's just that the timing was never really right. And that doesn't mean that it could never happen. That's not what I'm saying. What I am saying, though -- there you go -- is that the timing really isn't right now, either.",
        "Matthew: Well, what if you're wrong? What if this is the perfect time, especially for Paige?",
        "Bo: Ok, I get it. You're worried about her.",
        "Matthew: I asked her if she wanted to come to dinner tonight, and she said she wasn't feeling good. She's been like this for a long time.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah. Yeah, because, you know, you know how hard it is to try to get over losing somebody that you love so much. You know, that takes time.",
        "Matthew: But she needs something to make her feel good. We have to do something. We can't just give up on her.",

        "Nash: Oh -- fighting guys with boards sucks, huh?",

        "Vincent: Look, John, you know, that -- that kiss -- Natalie -- she told me that she told you, and I'm real happy to hear that you're not holding it against her.",
        "John: She thought I was dead.",
        "Vincent: And it's water under the bridge.",
        "John: When you thought I was Hugh, you said you had feelings for Natalie. I'm back now.",
        "Natalie: What did I miss?",

        "Dorian: Don't answer my question with a question. Where's she going? She couldn't have gotten done that fast.",
        "Blair: She's just dropping off my blood sample. They're going to do a rush job on it. But it looks like I might not have to have a C.A.T. scan, after all.",
        "Dorian: Don't tell me you're taking your diagnosis from an R.N.?",
        "Blair: I -- ahem -- may not have a brain tumor, after all -- I think I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We have to get one thing straight. Nobody is giving up on anybody, especially Paige. We just have to figure out the best way that we can help her.",
        "Matthew: And if you propose to her, that would make her so happy.",
        "Bo: I know, but -- yeah, but just for a little while. And then all of a sudden, she'd start getting pulled right back in the other direction by all the grief that she's feeling about losing Hugh. You see? I mean, that's just too much of a -- I don't know -- an emotional roller coaster for anybody to handle. We might end up even pushing her further away.",
        "Matthew: So what do you suppose we do, dad?",
        "Bo: I say we do exactly what you did. We invite her to dinner, and we keep inviting her to dinner. And we -- we remind her that she always has a place here, with people that -- that care about her and that want to help. We just have to, you know, take little steps.",
        "Matthew: So, we just keep asking her?",
        "Bo: We just keep asking her. Deal?",

        "Antonio: Well, I'm glad we found you when we did.",
        "Nash: Yeah, because the look in their eyes wasn't one of good will.",
        "Jessica: Oh -- yeah, well, when they looked at me, they didn't really see me, they saw Tess.",
        "Antonio: Well, but you did great.",
        "Jessica: Um -- you know how we said that we weren't going to tell Bree everything about Tess and show her all --",
        "Nash: I think we can forget about this event. And we'll forget about these photos, too.",

        "Starr: How do I even talk to him about any of this?",
        "Viki: Believe it or not, he feels the same way. He's afraid to talk to you. But I think the mere fact that you want to talk means a lot.",
        "Starr: I don't even know what I would say to him. I don't know what to think.",
        "Viki: Ok. Start with what you know -- that you love him. He's your dad. Tell him that. Say \"Dad, I love you.\" You can't even imagine what it will mean to him to hear that from you.",
