        "Aubrey asks Kelly not to tell Joey how she feels about him. When Joey asks Kelly what her news is, she tells him she is in love with one of her exes. Joey asks if she is talking about him. She lies and says that she and Kevin are reconnecting. Joey wonders why she wanted to see him when she went to London. She says she just wanted to catch up. Joey is about to go call Kevin but Kelly stops him and asks him to keep the news to himself for now. Aubrey wonders to Kelly if Joey knowing that Kelly was still in love with him would change anything. Clint tells his Lackey, Vimal that the girl that Aubrey is after the Buchanan fortune. Vimal offers to get her out of their lives the way he did with Rex. Gigi stops Rex from showing Brody the DNA test results that he found. Rex wonders why Gigi doesn't want Brody and Natalie to know that Marty faked the DNA results, but Gigi refuses to answer. When Natalie comes home, Rex asks her if Brody is her baby's father. Natalie thinks Gigi told Rex. Rex assures Natalie that Gigi refused to tell him anything; he figured it out on his own. Natalie tells Rex about her one-night-stand with Brody when they both thought Jessica and John were permanently unavailable. Rex tells her that he will keep her secret and that he is always there for you. Natalie wonders how Rex knew, and he tells her that he found the DNA report in Marty Saybrooke's house while he was investigating another case.",
        "Ford and Starr stand up to Eddie in James's defense. Ford challenges Eddie to a fight with a promise that Eddie will leave town if he loses. Ford admits to Langston that he doesn't know how to fight. Ford calls Inez to warn her that Eddie is still in town. Bo goes to the gym and tells Bo that Inez doesn't like the idea of Ford fighting Eddie. Inez calls Clint and tells him he didn't hold up his end of the bargain so she doesn't to hold up hers. He tells her he doesn't intend to get rid of Eddie until after she sleeps with Bo. John sees Inez crying and offers to help. She says she thinks she needs to talk to a professional. John gives Inez Marty's number.",
        "Bo is perplexed by the messages he has been receiving from \"Nora,\" especially the one that says he should sleep with Inez. Nora is tied to a chair thinking about the conversations she has had with her captive, Eddie Ford and she figures out that Clint is behind it. Nora manages to turn on the TV with her foot and turns the volume up to get attention. The manager calls the police about the noise. Eddie comes back to the hotel and tells Nora she is wasting her time because no one cares. He binds her tighter and tells her that when she misbehaves she will be punished. Brody bangs on the door and demands that he open the door. Matthew goes to the police station and asks Bo for permission to drop his last period study hall so he can go to work earlier. Bo says school has to be his priority. When Matt asks where his mother is, Bo reveals that he has no idea because they had an argument. Matt accuses Bo of cozying up to Nate's mother. Bo reveals to Inez that he thinks Clint is responsible for the change in Matt's attitude and that he doesn't like it. Matthew arrives at Clint's office as Clint is telling Vimal that he will know that Vimal betrayed him if anyone ever finds out that he is Rex's father or that Brody is not Natalie's baby's father. Matt tells Clint that Bo doesn't know where Nora is and doesn't seem to care. Clint Tells him that he is sure Nora will be back soon and will sign the permission slip. Matthew suggests that Clint ask Vimal to fake the signature, since Vimal has faked other things for Clint. Clint asks Matthew what he thinks he knows. Matthew tells him that he knows he is Rex's father."

        "Ford: You want to box? Let's go. You and me. 10 rounds. If I win, you leave town and you don't come back here again.",
        "Eddie: I'm not sure I like that deal.",
        "Starr: What's wrong? You can pick on James but you're scared of his big brother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: If you tell Joey how you feel about him, it will change everything for me.",
        "Kelly: Is that what you think?",
        "Aubrey: Is that what you're gonna do?",
        "Joey: Okay, Kelly. So you heard my big news. So now it's on you. What did you want to tell me? Come on. The suspense is killing me. Out with it.",

        "Clint: What do you want?",
        "Vimal: Is this a bad time?",
        "Clint: Yes, it's a bad time. I just found out that my son wants to marry a girl that he barely knows. If she's not after the Buchanan fortune, I'll eat my 10 gallon hat! This is the last thing I need...after everything I've done to protect this family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: I'll thank you to stay out of my family's business, little--",
        "James: Whoa! How about you stay out of Starr's face?",
        "Eddie: Now you're the tough guy, instead of when you should have been keeping your guard up.",
        "James: My guard is up.",
        "Starr: No, James! Stop! That was dumb of me. I shouldn't have talked to him.",
        "Ford: Hey! Show's over here.",
        "Eddie: And what show would that be? The one where I pummel your face for 10 rounds in front of your friends?",
        "Ford: Or the one where I pummel yours?",
        "Eddie: Not likely.",
        "Ford: No, there's one reason why you're not gonna take this deal.",
        "Eddie: Oh, yeah?",
        "Ford: 'Cause you know I'm gonna run your ass out of town with your tail between your legs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: This is for...",
        "Bo: Oh, thank you.",
        "Inez: Did you get a text from Nora, apologizing for what she said?",
        "Bo: No, no. I'm still trying to figure out the one she sent telling me that I should sleep with you.",
        "Inez: I'm so sorry, Bo.",

        "Brody: Hey, Rex, what's up?",
        "Rex: I need to see Natalie.",
        "Brody: I think she might have gone into work. Let me check.",
        "Rex: No, wait. This involves you, too, Brody.",
        "Brody: What is that? Is there something wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Go home. You look beat. Gorgeous, but beat. I think sometimes junior takes it out of you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I think you're right. And I am gonna go home, but...I need to talk to you about something first, and it's something you're not gonna like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Yeah, something's wrong. You've got to see this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: So, what do you mean?",
        "Kelly: I mean I'm in love.",
        "Joey: That's great! Who's the lucky guy?",
        "Kelly: Actually, he's an ex of mine, someone I've known for a long time. A lot's happened between us, but we always end up back together. We were even married for a while.",
        "Joey: Kelly. Are you talking about me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I'm gonna go get those other files that you wanted.",
        "Bo: Thank you, Inez.",
        "Matthew: Honestly, I don't even want to know what's going on with you and Nate's mom.",
        "Bo: What can I do for you, son?",
        "Matthew: Sign this.",
        "Bo: You want permission to skip the last period, leave school early? What for?",
        "Matthew: So I can go to work at B.E. earlier.",
        "Bo: Don't you think you already spend enough time at work?",
        "Matthew: I'd only be missing study hall.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't care. I think you're at that office way too much.",
        "Matthew: Why are you so weird about me working for Uncle Clint?",
        "Bo: Matthew, we have been over this time and again. School comes first.",
        "Matthew: Fine. Where's Mom? I'll get her to sign it.",
        "Bo: I have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora's voice: Can I at least speak to my husband?",
        "Eddie's voice: So you can tell him where we are.",
        "Nora's voice: So I can tell him that I'm okay.",
        "Eddie's voice: Oh, sweetheart. By the time we're through here, you're not gonna care.",
        "Nora's voice: Why won't my husband care that I'm missing? Are you texting him from my phone?",
        "Eddie's voice: You want to hear the rest of it? \"That after all this time, we still have Sam Rappaport between us.\" Looks like the Bo-meister here just threw you to the wolves.",
        "Nora's voice: Did Inez put you up to this?",
        "Eddie's voice: Oh, that's choice.",
        "Nora's voice: I know she's got a thing for Bo. I just never thought she'd take it this far.",
        "Eddie's voice: Then you don't know Inez very well. She's an evil genius, that one.",
        "Nora's voice: Who else would want to see Bo and me split up? Inez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Vimal, you made sure that I wasn't forced to admit that Rex Balsom is my son. I haven't forgotten that, but you should.",
        "Vimal: Consider it forgotten.",
        "Clint: That's what I like to hear.",
        "Vimal: Should I also forget that I maneuvered the DNA test to say that Brody Lovett was the father of your daughter's child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What's on your mind?",
        "Natalie: Lamaze.",
        "John: Lamaze? What is that? French? Huh? Some new-age thing? Is that the thing that I try to coach you to breathe while you scream about how much you hate me for getting you pregnant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What is it?",
        "Gigi: Wait! Stop.",
        "Rex: Geeg, what's wrong? Something happen to Shane?",
        "Gigi: Shane's fine. Everything's fine. I need to talk to you.",
        "Rex: Well, just wait a second. What I have to tell Brody is a little more crucial.",
        "Gigi: No, it isn't.",
        "Rex: It isn't?",
        "Brody: Are you guys okay?",
        "Gigi: Rex found out about a surprise, and I forgot to tell him to keep it to himself. Otherwise it wouldn't be a surprise, right?",
        "Brody: It's a good thing you didn't blow it. Anyway, I gotta get to work.",
        "Gigi: Have a nice night. It's a good thing Brody didn't see those DNA results.",
        "Rex: What are you talking about? Brody needs to know that Marty faked the DNA test saying that he's the father of Natalie's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I knew it. Taking you to a roomful of hormonal women and their partners learning how to time contractions and breathing--not your idea of a good time.",
        "John: No, it's not, but I'll be there.",
        "Natalie: Really?",
        "John: Yeah. We're in this together, right? And I want to be with you through all of it even if you're gonna curse me like a drunken sailor when the baby comes.",
        "Natalie: I'll be a lot worse than a drunken sailor.",
        "John: Bring it.",
        "Natalie: Okay. You just remember you said that, 'cause class starts tomorrow. I'll text you with the time and place.",
        "John: All right. No problem. It's our baby, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What's the problem? Geeg, John is the father of Natalie's baby. Brody, Natalie, and John all need to know Marty's making this up.",
        "Gigi: No, they don't.",
        "Rex: Why not? Geeg, why don't you want me to show Brody the test results? Because... because it's true? Brody is the father of Natalie's baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: When Bobby and I got up this morning, you were gone and it was awesome. We thought we finally got rid of you.",
        "Eddie: Well, Merry Christmas. Daddy's still here.",
        "Ford: Why do you love Llanview so much?",
        "Eddie: Friends, family. What's not to love?",
        "Ford: He doesn't want to be near you. I don't want to be near you. Law enforcement's itching to bust your ass. So what reason could you possibly have for wanting to stay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I don't get it. How could you not know where Mom is? She's your wife and you guys practically work together.",
        "Bo: She's not in her office, son.",
        "Matthew: And?",
        "Bo: And what?",
        "Matthew: You got this look on your face when I asked you where Mom was. Something's up.",
        "Bo: We had an argument.",
        "Matthew: About what?",
        "Bo: I think that's between us.",
        "Matthew: So, you're saying Mom just took off?",
        "Bo: I got some messages from her, but she's not in her office and she won't answer her phone.",
        "Matthew: Have you tried to go out and look for her?",
        "Bo: I don't think that's a great idea, because it's pretty clear your mom needs her space.",
        "Matthew: So you and Mom get into a fight and then you're in here cozying up with Nate's mom? That's real nice, Dad. Real nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Man up, pops. Let's get this out there once and for all. You and me until I knock you back to Ohio.",
        "Eddie: Aw, for goodness sake. If you want me to beat the crap out of you for old times' sake, I'm game.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Excuse me.",
        "Brody: Hey!",
        "John: Yo, Matthew!",
        "Brody: Guess Matthew's upset with his dad.",
        "John: Teenagers. You gotta love 'em.",
        "Brody: That's what you and I have got to look forward to. Door slams, kids storming off. Public enemy number one in your own home.",
        "John: Yeah, I can't wait.",
        "Brody: You know, when I thought Ford might be my kid's dad, I had nightmares of him about Matthew's age finding out I wasn't really his father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Geeg, did Marty fake the DNA test, or is Brody really the father of Natalie's baby?",
        "Gigi: Please don't ask me that.",
        "Rex: But I'm asking you.",
        "Gigi: Just get rid of it, okay? Please just get rid of it and pretend this never happened, for everyone's sake.",
        "Natalie: Oh! What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Am I talking about you?",
        "Joey: You're not, right? I mean it sounds like you are, but--",
        "Kelly: No, no, no. Don't be absurd.",
        "Joey: You said you were in love with an ex, an ex you used to be married to. Oh, my God. Kevin?",
        "Kelly: Yes. Kevin.",
        "Joey: You're in love with my brother.",
        "Kelly: Exactly.",
        "Joey: But he said he proposed to you not too long ago and you turned him down.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, that was then. This is now. I went to London. We spent some time together. Kevin and I and Zane, we were a family. It was incredible. Everything started cooking for us. All the magic just kept flooding back.",
        "Joey: But right before you choked on that olive the other night, you said there were two reasons why you went to London. One was to see Zane, and the other was to see me.",
        "Kelly: I did go to London to see you, Joey, to catch up, hit some museums, see a show, but you weren't there. So that gave me some time alone with Kevin.",
        "Aubrey: Are you upset?",
        "Joey: I just don't know why it was so hard for Kelly to tell me.",
        "Kelly: Because I didn't know about Aubrey.",
        "Joey: So?",
        "Kelly: So, I didn't want you to feel weird, given our history. Kevin is your brother.",
        "Joey: I was okay with it when you married Kevin the first time... or I got to be.",
        "Kelly: Yes, I know that.",
        "Aubrey: So when's the wedding?",
        "Kelly: The wedding? Oh, the wedding. Yes, we are going to take things slowly. We have to figure out our whole long-distance problem. But I am sure you two are going to get married way before us.",
        "Aubrey: Me, too.",
        "Joey: Hold on for a second. I just gotta go make a phone call.",
        "Kelly: Wait! You can't call Kevin.",
        "Joey: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Vimal, I'm well aware how much you've done for the Buchanan family.",
        "Vimal: Then when do I get my promotion?",
        "Clint: Soon. You do know that all of this is just between you and me and nobody else. I will know who to blame if someone finds out that Brody Lovett is not the father of my future grandchild. And if Rex Balsom comes looking for my family fortune because he's discovered that I'm his father, then I will know that it was you who leaked that information. Now get the hell out of here.",
        "Vimal: Yes, sir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You two arguing? Is that what's going on?",
        "Gigi: No, we're fine. Right, Rex?",
        "Rex: Wrong. I'm sorry, Geeg.",
        "Gigi: Please don't.",
        "Rex: I have to. I cannot let this go.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Rex: Natty, is Brody the father of your baby?",
        "Natalie: You told him?",
        "Rex: Oh, my God. It's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I can't imagine what you went through before the paternity test. You must be seriously relieved.",
        "Brody: More than you'll ever know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Why can't he just do the decent thing and leave town without a boxing match?",
        "Eddie: Maybe he doesn't want to.",
        "Ford: Hey, she wasn't talking to you.",
        "Eddie: Sorry.",
        "Langston: This is so caveman. What if somebody gets hurt?",
        "Ford: Nobody's gonna get hurt. It's gonna be fine.",
        "Langston: Fine? It wasn't too long ago you were in the hospital because you were seriously injured from getting a beating.",
        "Ford: I'm all healed up, okay?",
        "Langston: Okay, well, shouldn't you be taking it easy?",
        "Ford: Trust me, it's gonna be easy. In fact, we might even have time to go eat some dinner when we're done. All right, Dad, let's do this.",
        "Eddie: Huh? Ah, hold it. You know, I never said that I would fight you now.",
        "Ford: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Inez: Sorry. Are you all right? Matthew seemed a little upset.",
        "Bo: It was bad enough when he was mad at Nora and me a year or so ago when we wouldn't let him have surgery, but this is almost worse.",
        "Inez: What do you mean?",
        "Bo: It's his attitude. It's really getting to me.",
        "Inez: That's normal, though, for a kid Matthew's age. Nate gives me attitude all the time. They're just asserting themselves.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but I think it's different here. I think my brother's responsible for this change in Matthew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: What's going on, Vimal?",
        "Vimal: Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Matthew: What's wrong with Vimal? Seems kind of worried.",
        "Clint: Oh, he always looks that way. It's nothing. So what's going on?",
        "Matthew: Well, my dad wouldn't give me permission to skip seventh period to come here. So I figured I'd ask my mom, but now I can't find her and neither can my dad.",
        "Clint: Your dad must be worried sick. I'm sure Bo has the entire police department out looking for her.",
        "Matthew: Not even close.",

        "Man: Hey! Turn that TV down!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Kevin and I just want to keep this kind of quiet for now.",
        "Joey: You think he wouldn't have wanted you to tell me? I'm his brother.",
        "Kelly: No, no, I know that. He just wanted to tell you in his own way at the right time. I just was so happy because when I saw you, my heart was ready to burst! Please just don't tell him, Joey.",
        "Joey: Okay, I won't, but I do need to call my mom and tell her that Aubrey accepted my proposal and will be my wife. She needs to start getting used to the idea.",
        "Kelly: Yes, yes, of course. Good luck. Yes.",
        "Aubrey: Wow, you're good. You almost had me convinced that you had fallen in love with Joey's brother all over again.",
        "Kelly: Had to say something.",
        "Aubrey: Listen, do you think that if Joey knew that you still loved him it would change anything?",
        "Kelly: Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Matthew, what's going on between your parents?",
        "Matthew: They had a fight.",
        "Clint: And now your father doesn't know where your mom is and he's not even out looking for her?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it's all pretty messed up.",
        "Clint: Must have been some fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Man: The other guests are complaining! This is a respectable establishment! You hear me?",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Man: Turn it down, or you'll be sorry!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Why not, Edward? We can get this over in 3 rounds if you last that long.",
        "Eddie: I got extenuating circumstances.",
        "Ford: Like what? You don't have a job here or any friends.",
        "Eddie: You don't know what I got here, boy.",
        "James: Oh, he's just stalling.",
        "Langston: Maybe that's a good thing.",
        "Starr: I think we should call this whole thing off.",
        "Ford: Scared of fighting somebody that can actually fight you back?",
        "Eddie: Scared of you? Not likely.",
        "Ford: All right, prove it.",
        "Eddie: Listen, if we're gonna do this thing, let's do it right. We need to get a crowd in here.",
        "Ford: Crowd, huh?",
        "Eddie: Yeah. What's a fight without spectators, gambling, a piece of tail to do the cards? You know, make it worth everybody's while. Unless, of course, you're afraid to let your friends see your dad beat the stuffing out of you.",
        "Ford: No. I've actually got no problem inviting friends over to watch me kick your ass.",
        "Eddie: Well, set it up, baby boy. I'll be there.",
        "Langston: Ford, you cannot be serious about doing this.",
        "James: If Dad wouldn't leave for 50 grand, what makes you think a fight's gonna make him leave?",
        "Ford: Langston, the guy is all ego. Okay? I hurt him, I humiliate him, he leaves town and goes back to that rock he crawled out from under.",
        "James: Think so?",
        "Ford: It's worth a try.",
        "Langston: No, it's not, not if it gets you hurt.",
        "Ford: Then I guess I better not get hurt.",
        "James: Do you really think you can take him?",
        "Ford: Dude, look at me. I work out every single day. Okay? Who knew muscles were good for more than just looking at? James, let me do this for you, okay?",
        "James: Bobby, I'm willing to do anything. I just want him gone.",
        "Ford: He will be.",
        "James: Thanks, bro. I'm gonna go call Mom 'cause she thinks Dad's gone, all right?",
        "Starr: Hey, wait. I'll go with you.",
        "James: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I guess it was a bad fight, but my dad wouldn't tell me what it was about, and now my mom's gone and he...",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Matthew: Nothing. I shouldn't say.",
        "Clint: Matthew, you know that you can tell me anything.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but I don't want you to get mad or jealous or anything like that.",
        "Clint: Why would I get mad or jealous?",
        "Matthew: Because when I got to the station, it looked like my dad was getting pretty friendly with your girlfriend--you know, Nate's mom.",
        "Clint: Well, actually, she's not my girlfriend anymore. Inez and I broke up.",
        "Matthew: You did?",
        "Clint: Yeah. Actually, you know something, though? Inez works for your dad, so it's only natural that they'd be friendly. I think whatever you saw between them was completely innocent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: That didn't sound good. What's going on?",
        "Inez: I hate to bother you with this, especially the way things are right now.",
        "Bo: It's okay. I could use the distraction. Is that about Eddie?",
        "Inez: He didn't leave town after all. He and Bobby are at this place-- Rourke's?",
        "Bo: Yeah, it's a boxing gym down on Angel Square. What are they doing there?",
        "Inez: Bobby is about to fight Eddie in the ring there, and I'm just really afraid that Eddie can really hurt him.",
        "Bo: I don't like the idea of a father fighting his own son. So I think I'll just head down there and see what's going on.",

        "Clint: What are you talking about?",
        "Inez: Eddie is still here. He didn't go anywhere, so I don't have to sleep with your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: No, Natalie. I swear I didn't tell him. I would never do that to you.",
        "Rex: She didn't, okay? Really. I practically forced her to tell me. She would not.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Gigi. I shouldn't have blamed you.",
        "Gigi: It's okay. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about. I'm gonna head on in to work. See you later.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Rex won't tell anyone. You can trust him with this.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. See you. You think I'm a horrible person, don't you?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Natalie: It's okay. I do.",
        "Rex: That is the last thing I would ever think about you. I cannot believe you've been dealing with this. You must be going through hell.",
        "Natalie: You could say that.",
        "Rex: What happened?",
        "Natalie: It was just one horrible, horrible night. Brody thought Jessica was never gonna come back to him. I thought that John was gonna be with Marty forever, and... I was drunk, and he was drunk. We kept drinking, and we were both so upset. It was just the stupidest mistake I have ever made in my entire life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thanks. Hey, Brody. Switchboard got a call from the manager at the Minuteman.",
        "Brody: Again?",
        "John: Hey, look. It's the job. Do me a favor. Go over and check it out, will you?",
        "Brody: The last time this guy called, he said he found somebody parking in his lot who wasn't staying there. And the time before that, it was a pillow that got stolen. What happened now? Somebody took too much ice?",
        "John: Probably. Check it out.",
        "Brody: Why don't we just ignore him? Maybe he'll learn to stop wasting our time.",

        "Kelly: But you won't tell him, will you?",
        "Aubrey: No. Why would I? You went to such extremes to cover up how you feel about Joey because you know he loves me and not you. Obviously, you wanted to avoid a humiliation of forcing Joey to reject you. I wouldn't want to embarrass you, either. But, Kelly, you made it sound like you and Kevin really had something, something special. Maybe you should consider getting back together again.",
        "Joey: Great news! My mother sends her heartfelt congratulations.",
        "Aubrey: Really?",
        "Joey: Mm-hmm. You have the official Viki Banks seal of approval.",
        "Aubrey: Wow. I say we go up to my room and celebrate our engagement.",
        "Joey: I like the sound of that. Guess we'll see you later.",
        "Kelly: Right, later.",
        "Joey: It was so good to catch up, and I really am happy for you and my brother.",
        "Kelly: I'm happy for you, too.",

        "Natalie: Oh, right. Stacy.",
        "Rex: Wow. Wasn't even talking about that epic failure. No, I was talking about something a little more recently before Gigi and I got back together.",
        "Natalie: You had sex with someone else?",
        "Rex: Oh! Sex is too strong a word. No, we just kissed.",
        "Natalie: Well, John doesn't even know that I slept with Brody. He thinks this baby is his.",
        "Rex: And I'm guessing Brody doesn't know that this is his baby, either.",
        "Natalie: I mean, he knew that there was a possibility he could be the father, given the timing. But when I got the results, I couldn't tell him, not when he was so happy that Jessica was having his baby and not Ford's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Oh, forgot about Aaron. He'll totally be down to see a live fight.",
        "Langston: Ford, this is crazy. There has to be some other way to get rid of your dad.",
        "Ford: Like what? Jail couldn't hold him. 50 grand couldn't buy him off. The only language this guy understands is violence. That's why I have to fight him. For James.",
        "Langston: I didn't know you knew how to fight. You do know your way around a ring, right? Please tell me that you've boxed before.",
        "Ford: Not even in gym class.",
        "Langston: What? How do you expect to win?",
        "Ford: Honestly, I have no idea.",
        "Langston: Great.",
        "Ford: Hey, you okay?",
        "James: Yeah, the trainer said it was just a mild concussion.",
        "Starr: You're lucky. It could have been worse.",
        "James: I'm fine, Starr, really.",
        "Langston: That's good. At least one Ford brother will make it out of here in one piece.",
        "James: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Ford: Langston's just ticked about the whole mano-a-mano--",
        "Langston: Your brother doesn't know how to fight, James. At all.",
        "Ford: Thanks.",

        "James: Is she for real? Bobby, are you kidding me? What are you thinking, dude?",
        "Bo: Hello, everybody.",
        "Ford: Hi.",
        "Bo: What happened, James? Did your dad hit you again?",
        "James: Yeah, but I popped him first, so he'll probably just say it was self- defense.",
        "Bo: Unfortunately, that's not illegal. And neither is this fight that your dad and Ford are planning.",
        "Ford: Let me guess. My mom told you about this, right?",
        "Bo: She doesn't like it. Neither do I.",
        "James: I don't like it so much now, either, Bobby.",
        "Bo: You've been in the hospital, what, twice this year? You heard the saying, \"three strikes, you're out\"?",
        "Ford: I never cared much for baseball.",
        "Langston: Will you please take this seriously, Ford?",
        "Ford: I am. Look, Commissioner, I appreciate what you've done for my brothers and for my mom, but I got a chance today to get this S.O.B. out of my brother's life, and I'm going to take it.",
        "Bo: All right. Where's Eddie now?",
        "Ford: He's probably back at the apartment with a 6-pack and a call girl.",
        "Starr: Why? What are you gonna do?",
        "Bo: I thought I'd just try to rattle his cage a little bit, see if I can do something so he won't show, won't beat up his son. You see, I'm a father myself, and this kind of thing just doesn't sit right with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Matthew: Coffee? Really?",
        "Clint: Go!",
        "Matthew: This is bull.",
        "Clint: Shut the door.",
        "Inez: You said Eddie was gone. Instead, he's here harassing my sons.",
        "Clint: Did you think that I was gonna get rid of Eddie before I found out that you kept your end of the deal? Eddie goes when you sleep with my brother.",
        "Inez: That could take weeks.",
        "Clint: Weeks? Get it done by morning.",
        "Inez: Tomorrow morning?",
        "Clint: From what I hear, Bo is wide open after his argument with Nora.",
        "Inez: Are you behind the messages that Bo's getting from her?",
        "Clint: What messages?",
        "Inez: You said that Nora wouldn't be a problem. Did you do something to her?",
        "Clint: Sleep with Bo tonight, and you'll never have to worry about Eddie Ford again. Inez, you'll have everything you've ever wanted...including my brother.",

        "Eddie: Nice try, bitch! But no one in this dump is paying any attention. I got a big fight coming up. If I didn't think it would get me into agua caliente, I'd practice on you. Pop pop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Thanks. You know something, Matthew, I think that your mother's gonna be back soon, and then you can get that permission slip signed. All right?",
        "Matthew: Or we could just get Vimal to fake it for me.",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Matthew: Yet again, that wouldn't be the first thing he faked for you, would it?",

        "Natalie: You're the best. I'll probably take you up on that offer sometime.",
        "Rex: I hope you do. I mean it. I'm sure Gigi feels the same way.",
        "Natalie: If Gigi didn't tell you about this, how did you find out?",
        "Rex: Your Uncle Todd hired me to work on a case that had nothing to do with you, or at least that's what I thought.",
        "Natalie: Todd doesn't know about this, does he?",
        "Rex: No, of course not. This case had nothing to do with you. He doesn't know anything, and I'm not gonna tell him. But while I was working on that, I found this.",
        "Natalie: My God. Where did you find this, at the DNA lab? Were you looking up info for someone else?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Natalie: Rex, where did you get this? I burnt the only copy.",

        "Starr: It's the least I could do. If I hadn't distracted you, your dad wouldn't have been able to get that shot in. I just can't wait until he's gone.",
        "James: You know, Starr, when I was fighting him, I really wanted to kill him.",
        "Starr: I don't blame you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I really hope Bo can stop this fight from happening, because if Eddie hurts you, I swear I'm gonna go after that pig myself.",
        "Bo: Got one of my guys working a case not far from your apartment. I asked him to check and see if Eddie's car was in the parking lot. It's not there.",
        "Ford: You're kidding.",
        "Bo: Any idea where he might have gone?",
        "Ford: No. Since he's gotten here, all he does is follow me and James around. I don't know where he is.",
