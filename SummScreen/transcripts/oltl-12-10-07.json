        "Todd: What you just said there.",
        "Blair: What about it?",
        "Todd: I think you meant \"loved\" -- with a \"d\" at the end.",
        "Blair: I know exactly what I meant. You know, Todd, when we got married this last time, it may have been for other reasons. But when I took those vows that day, I meant it, it was real. I love you. I always have and I always will. In all these years, you didn't know that? Well, now you do. And you know what? If the fact that my love for you and those two beautiful children in there love you isn't enough reason for you to stick around, then you know what? Maybe you should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: There is only one David Vickers.",
        "David: Actually, there are six David Vickers in the United States, and four across the pond with bank accounts exceeding $3 million -- not that I would ever take advantage of a mistaken identity.",
        "Dorian: You see? Your style, your wit -- those are two things a Buchanan man wouldn't know if it was branded on his butt. Know how to appreciate the best things in life. But I did. I still do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Starr: Come in.",
        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hey. Did Markko find Cole?",
        "Langston: No. I haven't heard from him, I've been unpacking.",
        "Starr: You like your room okay?",
        "Langston: Yeah, it's great.",
        "Starr: Good.",
        "Langston: Are you worried about Cole being out there all by himself?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I just -- I want to send him a text, but I just don't want to send him, you know, the wrong message.",
        "Langston: \"The wrong message\"?",
        "Starr: Well, with everything that's going on right now, I -- the whole situation -- he lost both of his parents -- what -- I'm sorry, I really don't know what I'm doing right now.",
        "Langston: No -- you were just thinking about Cole and what he's going through. You love him, you should be thinking about him.",
        "Starr: But the thing is, is that I usually always talk things over with you, Langston. But right now in this situation, I don't want to say anything that might remind you of -- no, I'm really sorry. I just -- I just don't know what to say right now.",
        "Langston: It's okay. I mean, just -- Cole's out there walking by himself because he can't do what I did. He can't just pretend that his mom didn't die. Everyone he sees, everyone he talks to knows that he's all alone right now.",
        "Starr: How am I supposed to help him?",
        "Langston: You're asking the wrong person. I didn't know how to deal with it when my parents died. Cole probably doesn't, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Get out of my way, John; I don't want to hurt you.",
        "John: Then don't.",
        "Cole: I have to do this!",
        "John: Then you'll have to shoot me first, Cole.",
        "Cole: John, please, get out of my way! Please!",
        "Miles: Cole, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Gigi, I'm scared.",
        "Gigi: It's, uh -- it's probably just Noelle. I told her that you're starting tomorrow and she's dying to meet you.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but she would just show up like this?",
        "Michael: Hello?",
        "Marcie: Oh, my God.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, that definitely isn't Noelle.",
        "Marcie: No, it's my husband!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So, Angela, the only reason that my friend did what he did is because that psycho, Spencer Truman, was blackmailing him.",
        "Rex: Hey, Rox, almost done?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, this is my last appointment. Oh, Rex, this is Angela. Angela, this is my son, Rex.",
        "Rex: Pleasure's all mine. Look, I want you to help me figure out what to get Adriana for Christmas.",
        "Roxy: Well, money's not bad.",
        "Rex: And personal, too.",
        "Roxy: You know, I'm rather surprised you're even here asking me that.",
        "Rex: It beats sitting home all day worrying about where Michael is.",
        "Roxy: Hey, stop laying it on Miles. Miles is the guy that I'm talking about; trust me, honey; he's a really nice guy.",
        "Rex: So -- whoa! I didn't know hair came in that many colors.",
        "Roxy: Uh -- yeah. Angela: What have you done to my hair?",
        "Roxy: Uh -- well, huh, nothing that can't be fixed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: John, I didn't mean to.",
        "Ramsey: \"He didn't mean to.\"",
        "John: Hey -- hey, listen, take it easy. Listen, you got to help me get Laurence.",
        "Ramsey: Laurence is dead in the water. He did it, he's running away. You are on your own.",
        "John: Hey -- hey, Ramsey! Laurence, let me tell you something -- when I get in there, you better be alive when I get there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hello?",
        "Marcie: What am I going to do? What am I going to do?",
        "Gigi: You're not going to panic. Are you sure the man at the door is your husband?",
        "Michael: Is anybody there?",
        "Marcie: Yes, that's definitely him! Look, what if he's not alone, okay? What if Todd's with him? What if the police are with him?",
        "Gigi: They would've already busted down the door. Here, take Tommy into the bathroom. I'll figure something out.",
        "Marcie: No, no, I got to get out of here!",
        "Gigi: Where are you going to go, Marcie? We got to think. Okay, he didn't say your name or Tommy's, right?",
        "Marcie: Right.",
        "Gigi: Okay. What would Michael do if he knew for sure the two of you were in here?",
        "Marcie: If he knew for sure?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: He'd break down that door.",
        "Gigi: Okay, then we're just going to keep our mouths shut and wait till he gives up and walks way, just like Todd Manning did.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Michael: Hello, is anybody there?",
        "Tommy: Dada.",
        "Michael: Tommy? Marcie, I heard that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I was a fool to ever let you go.",
        "David: You're not going to get all sentimental on me, are you?",
        "Dorian: It's just when you hear about the passing of somebody as young as Marty was, you can't help but examine your own life.",
        "David: I guess.",
        "Dorian: And then you walked in. And I couldn't help thinking about all the good times we had together, and we did have some good times, didn't we?",
        "David: Let's see -- the kitchen counter comes to mind.",
        "Dorian: David -- I was just so hurt and angry when I let you go.",
        "David: Did you receive an extra-large bump on your head when you were mowed over by that car at rancho Buchanan?",
        "Dorian: No, just a little old average bump.",
        "David: Well, I thought maybe you're acting a little loony, and that's why you're being so nice to me.",
        "Dorian: I'm always nice to you. I have never been more myself than I am at this moment.",
        "David: Good for you. Why?",
        "Dorian: Well, isn't that obvious? You're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Your turn to talk.",
        "Todd: I don't know what to say.",
        "Blair: Oh, it's pretty simple, Todd -- you either tell me whether you're staying or you're going.",
        "Todd: It's really not that simple, Blair. You make it sound like it is, but it isn't.",
        "Blair: Well, I'll make it simpler for you -- I'll go back inside. Either you show up or you don't.",
        "Todd: Hey, wait, wait, wait. The thing is --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: The thing is -- the hell with it.",
        "Todd: Blair --",
        "Blair: I don't feel like talking.",
        "Todd: So we're just going to stand here like this?",
        "Blair: You hate it?",
        "Todd: I just don't understand.",
        "Blair: Todd, what we do -- we mess up things when we start talking. You know, everything's all great and good, and then one of us opens our big mouths and hurts somebody. They get mad, and then -- you know, it gets all messed up and we never can get back to where it was.",
        "Todd: This is nice, not talking like this.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? Let's not talk for one whole minute and just hold each other. Okay?",
        "Todd: Okay.",
        "Blair: Todd?",
        "Todd: I thought you said a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Hmm. Well, that certainly was --",
        "Dorian: Yes, it certainly was.",
        "[David and Dorian chuckle]",
        "Dorian: We should have a party.",
        "David: Just the two of us?",
        "Dorian: No, a big party. We should throw a big party.",
        "David: What's the occasion? Is it my birthday? No. Let's say it's my birthday.",
        "Dorian: We'll wait a suitable amount of time, but this town has had enough tragedy, and the truth is we will be celebrating you and me.",
        "David: We will be?",
        "Dorian: Yes -- we both managed to rid ourselves of boring, stifling relationships that were dragging us down.",
        "David: I will drink to that.",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes. Everyone will find out that Dorian and David are back.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Dorian: And even our detractors will find out they cannot keep us down.",
        "David: Sort of an \"up yours\" party, right?",
        "Dorian: Crude, but that's exactly what I had in mind.",
        "David: Yeah, there's a few people I'd like to invite to that kind of party.",
        "Dorian: Hmm -- if only Viki weren't out of town.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "David: She could serve the chicken-fried steak.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "David: Never mind. There's sort of an overall problem with the concept of this party.",
        "Dorian: What's that?",
        "David: Well, people might get the wrong idea.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please! I don't intend to be subtle.",
        "David: Nevertheless, people aren't going to think that Dorian and David are just back in business. If you and I throw a party together, they're going to think that we're actually back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I really do think that I should call him. I should see if he's okay.",
        "Langston: No, Starr. He said he wanted some time alone.",
        "Starr: Well, I've said a lot of things in the past and I mean the exact opposite.",
        "Langston: Where's he even going to go?",
        "Starr: I don't know, he could be anywhere right now, Langston. That's why --",
        "Langston: No, no. I mean, where's he going to live, now that his mom --",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh, I didn't even think about that! I'm such an idiot!",
        "Langston: No, you're not --",
        "Starr: No, I am an idiot.",
        "Langston: You're not an idiot, okay? It's really hard to wrap your head around what Cole's going through right now.",
        "Starr: But those are the questions that I should be thinking about. I should be thinking about \"where is he going to live?\" He doesn't have any relatives, so who is he going to stay with? Who's going to pay for him?",
        "Langston: Stop. I hate to admit it, but he needs an adult. He needs your Aunt Dorian.",
        "Starr: No, he needs his mom, Langston. He does, and now she's gone.",
        "Langston: Starr, listen to me. You and Cole and Markko and your Aunt Dorian -- you're what made the difference for me, and that's what's going to make the difference for Cole. He knows he has good friends and a lot of people who care about him. And you -- he has you. And when he's ready, Cole will come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Laurence!",
        "John: Damn, Laurence, you can't be dead. I'm not going to let you die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I know you're in there, Marcie.",
        "Gigi: Guess we got to go to Plan B.",
        "Marcie: Which is?",
        "Michael: Marcie, please, I love you. Just open the door and we can figure all this out, okay? Marcie, I'm alone. No one knows I'm here. We don't have to involve anybody else, okay, just the three of us. I'm not moving, Marcie. I'm not going anywhere until you open this door and let me see you and Tommy.",
        "Gigi: What's all the commotion out here?",
        "Michael: I'm looking for Gigi's friend.",
        "Gigi: [Texas accent] Then you'd be done looking.",
        "Michael: You know Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Wouldn't be her friend if I didn't, would I? Whom I looking at?",
        "Michael: My name's Michael McBain. Moe and Noelle from the cafe across the street -- they sent me over here.",
        "Gigi: Why would they do that?",
        "Michael: Look, I'm sorry to bother you. I really thought you were somebody else.",
        "Gigi: Honey, sometimes I wish I was.",
        "Michael: I didn't catch your name.",
        "Gigi: Didn't throw it.",
        "Michael: I am looking for my wife and son. I have got to find them, and I really thought for a minute --",
        "Gigi: Name's Sally Ann, mister, and you know what? I'm the only one that's here.",
        "Michael: I heard a child's voice say \"Daddy.\"",
        "Gigi: That was me sang \"dagnabit,\" because I was trying to get some sleep, then someone started banging on my door and wouldn't stop.",
        "Michael: I was so sure.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, folks hear what they want to hear.",
        "Michael: Moe and Noelle said you have a son?",
        "Gigi: Did they give you my shoe size and social security number, too?",
        "Michael: Is he here?",
        "Gigi: No, he's -- uh -- over at Gigi's. And I feel for you, Mister, but I'm hard-pressed to understand why my business is any of yours.",
        "Michael: Well, can you at least tell me if you have seen my wife and son? You're lying to me. They were here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: And what would be so bad about people thinking we're back together?",
        "David: People, or one person in particular?",
        "Dorian: I don't care what that two-timing cowboy thinks.",
        "David: Obviously not. But he just might get the absolute wrong impression.",
        "Dorian: Which would be?",
        "David: That you and I were back together simply because you were trying to prove to him that you were over him, when, in fact, you're not.",
        "Dorian: But that's preposterous. Oh, I -- I am so over that double-dealing Don Juan.",
        "David: Then why did you kiss me? You don't really want me.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Now you're going to tell me what I want and don't want?",
        "David: Dorian, I'm the guy that you slept with in Texas to get even with Clint. I'm the same guy that you kissed because Nora rubbed your nose in the fact that you're not going to get him back. Clint may have broken your heart, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to let you settle for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You can relax now.",
        "Todd: Was that a minute?",
        "Blair: Longest minute in your life.",
        "Todd: Have I done something wrong?",
        "Blair: No, Todd, it was perfect. You want to go back inside?",
        "Todd: No -- Dorian's in there.",
        "Blair: It's her house.",
        "Todd: So she keeps reminding me. You know what I wish?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Well, I wish a lot of things, but right now I wish that you and I and Starr and Jack were back living in the penthouse where we belong.",
        "Blair: You just can't handle Dorian.",
        "Todd: I can handle Dorian. I can't stand Dorian.",
        "Blair: Why do you let her under your skin?",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, like you don't?",
        "Blair: I don't.",
        "Todd: Yeah. The minute we walk back in there, you're going to act all guilty the minute she sees us.",
        "Blair: We're two consenting adults.",
        "Todd: Doesn't make any difference. She's going to see us and know something happened between us and she's going to start in on us.",
        "Blair: Ignore her.",
        "Todd: Yeah, like she could be ignored.",
        "Blair: Well, what do you want to do? Want to go back in or --",
        "Todd: No, no, no, let's -- let's stay out. Let's finish this.",
        "Blair: \"Finish\"?",
        "Todd: Yeah, you told me how you felt, and you asked me how I felt.",
        "Blair: Yeah?",
        "Todd: I think you deserve an answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Coles strong. He'll be okay. You know, why don't we just wait up until he calls?",
        "Starr: You wouldn't mind?",
        "Langston: No, of course not. I'm going to go say good night to your Aunt Dorian, okay? Starr? It's going to be okay.",
        "Starr: Oh, let's see.",
        "Starr: Cole? Oh, my God! Cole, what are you doing? Here, I'll help you. Cole, are you okay? Come here! Oh, my gosh, I was so worried about you! Where have you been? Why did you have to sneak in?",
        "Cole: I didn't want anyone to see me, all right? I'm in big trouble, Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: At least let me wash this mask off, okay? And, you know, maybe I should do color on the other side over here. You know, those colors -- they are really in style this season, and, you know, you'll get a lot of attention! The way a bad nose job gets.",
        "Rex: I should've kept my mouth shut",
        "Roxy: And I should've put a sock in it. I was so distracted, I put those hideous colors in there. Oh, man. Oh, I was talking too much about Miles.",
        "Rex: I noticed.",
        "Roxy: You know, I'm just worried about what's going to happen to the poor guy. I mean, he's finally getting his act together, and then his ex-wife has to get whacked in Iran?",
        "Rex: Ireland.",
        "Roxy: Didn't I say that? What's going to happen to the poor guy?",
        "Rex: Marty's kid is the one that you should be worried about. Miles is a big boy, he'll be okay.",
        "Roxy: Look, you don't know him like I do. He is sentimentally and sensitively challenged.",
        "Rex: You've known the guy for about 2 1/2 minutes.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but we had a lot of quality time doing that community service crap, and, you know, we worked very hard on having a -- a meaningful relationship as acquaintances.",
        "Rex: If you say so.",
        "Roxy: Now, listen, I know that he truly loved his ex-wife, and the fact that she got burned and blown up -- he's going to need to talk to somebody about his feelings.",
        "Rex: And you think you should be the one to help him?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, you know, all my customers say that talking to me is as good as talking to a shrink. In fact, more than one of them has said that I am totally certifiable.",
        "Rex: Hmm. And while you're helping Miles with his feelings, what about yours?",
        "Roxy: My what?",
        "Rex: Your feelings for him. Mom, you're crazy about the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I've had enough of this crap.",
        "Gigi: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Michael: This is my son's shirt. Where is he?",
        "Gigi: That is my son's shirt. And if you don't want me to call the police right now --",
        "Michael: You see this stain? You see this stain? This is marinara sauce. He got it all over him one night at dinner, and I never heard the end of it. Marcie tried to get the stain out, but no amount of washing would work.",
        "Gigi: Look, I'm real sorry for your loss -- Michael, was it? But you're barking up the wrong tree here. Um -- if you would look at the tag, I highly doubt they only shipped one of these over from china.",
        "Michael: But the stain --",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, you'd think my boy is half Italian by the way he loves that stuff. He just hasn't exactly figured out how to push those noodles",
        "Michael: I'm sorry, I know this sounds crazy.",
        "Gigi: Well, what you sound like is a man who misses his wife and kid so much, he sees them every which way he turns.",
        "Michael: I was so sure.",
        "Gigi: Um -- ahem -- if you don't mind saying, what made all this happen?",
        "Michael: I did what I swore I'd never do and I lied to my wife. I made her think that she couldn't trust me, so she ran away and she took our son.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry.",
        "Michael: I'm sorry, too. Because of me, Marcie's in trouble. She and Tommy are out there all alone. And I don't know if I'll ever see them again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, you were totally blindsided when you found out about Marty's death. And, you know, you don't have to talk about anything until you're ready to deal with it.",
        "Todd: No, I owe you an answer.",
        "Blair: No, you don't. I was freaking out because you said you were going to walk away from us, and I said a lot of things I probably shouldn't have.",
        "Todd: Well, that's okay.",
        "Blair: It's not okay. When I heard about Marty, I looked up and I saw Cole's face, knowing that he would -- he would never see his mother again. And then I thought of you and I thought, well -- I wanted to tell you how I felt, because I -- I -- I don't know what's going to happen.",
        "Todd: Okay. I know.",
        "Blair: I can't even pretend to know what -- what you must feel about this situation with Marty, and I don't want you to just say things to me because I feel like I've twisted your arm into saying it, okay?",
        "Todd: You'd -- you'd like to hear it in the -- the cold, hard light of day?",
        "Blair: I want to hear it when all of this is behind us. You know where you can find me.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Todd: I'm not going to lose track of you. Can we go in? I'm starting to freeze my ass off now.",
        "Blair: You bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: \"Settle for you\"? Oh, my dear, darling David, what has happened to your self-esteem?",
        "David: I don't have a problem with my self-esteem. If I were a woman, I'd be on the prowl for me.",
        "Dorian: Oh, so this isn't a self-esteem problem?",
        "David: Dorian, we have been forced together, thrown together, and even chosen to be together, but the final result -- it's always the same.",
        "Dorian: But this is different.",
        "David: Because we'd be getting together for revenge?",
        "Dorian: You make it sound as if we're nothing to each other.",
        "David: No, we both know that's not true, but maybe we're better off as friends.",
        "Dorian: With benefits?",
        "David: The benefits are the best part.",

        "[David and Dorian chuckle]",
        "Blair: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh -- what is going on?",
        "David: That's another reason this would never work out. A little too crowded for naked tai chi.",

        "Cole: It wasn't my fault, all right?",
        "Starr: Well, what did you do? Did -- did you do something? I -- I want to help you.",
        "Cole: You can't help me! No one can!",
        "Starr: But I love you, Cole! Just please tell me where you went tonight.",
        "Cole: I -- I had to get out of there. I couldn't stand the way everybody was looking at me, feeling sorry for me, so I walked -- I don't even know where I was walking to. I just -- just walked. I was -- ended up down by the river, down by the docks, and -- and that's when I heard them.",
        "Starr: You heard who?",
        "Cole: I don't know -- I couldn't tell at first because they -- it was so far away, but -- but then I got closer and I could hear it was John's voice.",
        "Starr: John McBain?",
        "Cole: Yeah, he was -- he was fighting with another guy.",
        "Starr: Who, who?",
        "Cole: I don't know -- it was the guy that -- it was the F.B.I. agent that went with him to Ireland.",
        "Starr: What were they -- okay, what -- what were they fighting about?",
        "Cole: I don't know -- I -- I couldn't tell at first. I was -- the one guy had his gun out, and then -- and then they were screaming at each other, and then -- and then -- and then I -- the closer I got, I could understand what they were saying, and John said it. He -- he --",
        "Starr: What did he say? Cole, what did he say?",
        "Cole: He said he killed her. He said -- he said the other guy killed my mom.",
        "Starr: The F.B.I. agent? But -- but, Cole, you said that that was an accident.",
        "Cole: Yeah, he's the one that caused the accident! He shot the tires out on the van! That's how he killed my mom!",

        "Rex: Why not?",
        "Roxy: Because he's Mitch Laurence's brother, that's why not!",
        "Rex: Mitch is dead.",
        "Roxy: Not in here, he's not. He's still a psycho in my nightmares.",
        "Rex: Okay, so he has an evil brother. What else is wrong with him?",
        "Roxy: I never said anything was wrong with him.",
        "Rex: Something's keeping you apart.",
        "Roxy: You. You're what's keeping us apart. You keep on putting him down!",
        "Rex: Forget about me. What do you think about him?",
        "Roxy: Well, I think he's sweet. And I think he's kind. I think he's really good-looking. And he's loyal. He doesn't even know that he is. And, you know, when I walk into the room, he doesn't roll his eyes and sigh and turn his head like other people in this town do.",
        "Rex: Anything else?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. He likes to talk to me. And it makes me feel as if he really wants to know about me, like he cares about me. And that smile of his -- you know, I can go that whole day just on that smile all alone. Oh, my God. You're right. I'm crazy about the guy.",

        "John: This is John McBain. I'm at Pier 27 off of Front Street. I just pulled a G.S.W. out of the river. No. No, I can't find a pulse. Send a bus right away. I'm beginning CPR.",

        "David: Huh.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, she's right in your wheelhouse. Better hurry along, though, because she might be shopping for a younger model. You're getting a little long in the tooth.",
        "David: I'm a little surprised to find you here.",
        "Todd: Why is that?",
        "David: Well, I saw on the news that you were on an all-out search for little Tommy McBain. Are you already tired of looking for your own son?",

        "Gigi: When my son has the flu and I can't stay home myself and take care of him, and when he asks about his daddy.",
        "Michael: That's what drives me nuts when I think about Marcie and Tommy -- the idea that they're out there all alone. And the most important thing to me is that they are safe. Even if I knew that I would never see them again, as much as that would kill me, if I knew they were safe, I could live with it. It wouldn't be much of a life, but, I mean, at least I'd know.",
        "Gigi: If your wife were here right now, what would you say to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Who would have thought that plucky, perky little Marcie McBain could elude the police, the F.B.I., and all the manpower you could buy? Because certainly, at some point, someone must have seen her. But if they did, and then they met you, they probably figured the little kid was better off with Marcie.",

        "Todd: Yeah -- by the way, as long as you're in town, stay away from me. And if you try to hit Viki up for money, I'll put you back in a Moroccan prison before you can spend it.",

        "Gigi: Where would you start?",
        "Michael: I'd tell her how much she changed me. And -- I don't know how she does it, but somehow, the moments when we are together are so much better than the moments when we're not. And then Tommy came along, and he was like what we'd been waiting for.",
