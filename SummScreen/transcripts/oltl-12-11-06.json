        "Dorian has done the math and she knows that this child could easily be Spencer's. Blair will not entertain that thought. She can't have that happen. This man tortured her children and Todd and if she ends up pregnant for Spencer, Todd will never forgive her and all that she has built in the last little while will be over and done with forever. Spencer wants to know where Todd is taking him. Todd will not tell him. It's a surprise! The only clue he gives is that he isn't going to Atlantic City. \"You know that whatever you do will not change the fact that I had you strapped in for execution and Blair was my woman.\" Todd smiles as he drives. He drools at the thought of how Spencer is going to wish he were dead. They get to the location and Spencer is pushed into a small, dark room. It is the room where Spencer kept Margaret. He kept her there until she popped with Todd's baby. Spencer says that Todd probably didn't want that kid then anyway. Some of the mother's psychosis might have been passed down to the child. \"WHERE IS MY KID?\" Spencer says that he doesn't know. THWACK! Spencer pistol-whips him. \"Wrong answer.\" Spencer laughs. He knows that Todd won't kill him. He knows that Todd knows that this kid will never be found if he is dead. Todd knows that the man is right. He has another idea. He duct tapes Spencer to a chair and rigs the crazy bastard's head so that it faces the ceiling and has to stay that way. Todd is going to do the Chinese Water Torture. He rigs the machine to drop water on the man drop by drop at an even rate of speed. \"Soon you will go stark raving mad.\" Spencer smiles. He finds this absurd. Todd leaves him alone now. He has some things to do. Bo tells an officer to go and check on the transport of Spencer to the mental hospital. That soon returns and reports that the guards were found unconscious beside the van and Spencer is gone. Antonio and Bo head out to talk to the guards. Seems like someone busted Spencer out but Bo knows that the man's associates are accounted for. Bo and Antonio find that there are fresh tire marks showing a vehicle drove in there, did a U-turn, and drove back the way it came. \"Wait a minute. What if this is someone who was mad with the trial was handled and took matters into their own hands?\" Antonio knows that could be anyone. \"Are you talking about me?\" Bo and Antonio turn to find Antonio standing in the doorway casual as ever. Spencer is fine at first and smirking, but soon he can't help but look up into the hole where the drop comes from. It falls on his face and he looks down. He looks up again, the drop falls and he looks down"

        "Spencer: Crime, Manning? What crime? What scene of what crime? Which on",
        "Todd: Go down the list, pick one. Oh, but there are so many. Tell you what, I'll narrow it down for you -- it's not Atlantic City.",
        "Spencer: I know you hate me, buddy. I really do. But this is about more than that, isn't it?",
        "Todd: I don't know -- I hate you quite a bit.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, I bet you do, but I can't figure out what it is, though. You know, was it the fact that I successfully had your ass executed, or the fact that I had your girlfriend in love with me afterwards? Which one is it?",
        "Todd: No, I don't think -- you're full of questions, aren't you? Are you going to start screaming \"are we there yet, are we there yet?\"",
        "Spencer: That all depends on where we're going, how long it takes to get there, and what you plan on doing to me when we do get there.",
        "Todd: Oh, well, I -- I don't want to give away the ending and spoil all the fun. But I tell you what, though, it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt so bad you'll wish you were dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: We did it.",
        "Rex: Lifted the files from the hospital and bounced without a trace.",
        "Adriana: Dorian saw us.",
        "Rex: Whatever quid pro quo she asks for later will be worth it, don't you think?",
        "Adriana: Michael and Marcie need these files to keep Tommy healthy. It's just --",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Adriana: Can you live with the secret that Todd and Margaret are the biological parents?",
        "Rex: There's no other way.",
        "Adriana: I just want you to be sure. Because once you give Michael and Marcie these records, that's it. There's no going back from there.",
        "Michael: Ok.",
        "Adriana: Oh -- they're here.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Michael: Hey, guys.",
        "Marcie: I can't believe that you already found out who Tommy's birth parents are. That's amazing.",
        "Adriana: I should go.",
        "Marcie: No. No, no. Please stay. Rex is Tommy's Godfather, which means you're practically family, right?",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie: So, where are they?",
        "Michael: Yeah, could we -- could we see the files?",
        "Marcie: What? What? What -- what's wrong?",
        "Rex: I -- I'm going to hand over the files, I promise. But there's something you need to know about where Tommy came from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Where the hell's the nurse? I mean, it's just a blood test, for crying out loud.",
        "Dorian: Blair, you haven't answered my question yet. Could you be pregnant with Spencer's baby?",
        "Blair: Look, we don't even know if I'm pregnant yet.",
        "Dorian: But if you are --",
        "Blair: If I am pregnant, I am pregnant with Todd's baby. Todd's -- you hear me? It has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Damn it.",
        "Officer: Commissioner?",
        "Bo: They lost communication with the vehicle that was transporting Spencer Truman to Wingdale. Now, I want you to find out what happened. I want to know if he got there or not.",
        "Officer: You got it. I'll get right on it, boss.",
        "Bo: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Is this the best you could do, Manning, huh? Just exactly what the hell you planning on doing with me in here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Yeah? Yes, I know you got them good. But seriously, honey, are you ok? Yes. Ok. I -- ahem -- I promise those guys won't get near you again, ok? All right. Me, too, you. Ahem.",
        "Bo: I couldn't help but overhear. How's Jess doing?",
        "Antonio: Oh, well, Tess' past kind of caught up to her.",
        "Bo: Caught up to her how?",
        "Antonio: A couple of slime-balls were harassing her. Jess is fine. Nash and I got to her in time before it got too out of hand.",
        "Bo: She's got to be rattled, though.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, Nash is with her right now till I get off duty. I should be there.",
        "Bo: I know. I wish I could spare you, Antonio, but we may have a situation go down.",
        "Officer: Excuse me, Commissioner? They located the transport vehicle. It's about 10 miles south of Wingdale. The guards are unconscious, and Truman is gone.",
        "Bo: Ah. That's our situation. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh. Huh. You recognize this place, Spencer? You stored things here, didn't you? What was it you stored? Files? No, sir. Furniture? No. I remember. I remember now -- a crazy bitch. A crazy bitch. This was your halfway house for Margaret Cochran while I was on death row, right? You kept her here and waited for her to pop. And then she popped -- beautiful, bouncing baby boy. You delivered my son -- yes? -- And then you scrambled Margaret's brains, shipped her off to Bangkok.",
        "Spencer: Do you realize if you kill me now, Manning, you're going to end up right back on death row?",
        "Todd: Not if I fake crazy. Tell me where my son is if you want to live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I knew it. I knew it -- they want -- they want Tommy back, right? I mean, I knew it, I knew it. What -- Michael, what are we going to do?",
        "Rex: No, no, no, no, no, no. It -- it's nothing like that.",
        "Michael: What we're going to do is we're going to deal with it -- together.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Rex: It -- it's just Tommy's biological mother -- she was mentally ill.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Michael: Are we talking about a genetic condition?",
        "Rex: Don't know. There's a lot of words in her file ending in \"osis.\" I -- I just thought that I should prepare you for that.",
        "Michael: May I see the documents, please?",
        "Marcie: Why are there a lot of black-out spaces? I mean, isn't this where the patient's name should be, right?",
        "Michael: Excuse me, honey.",
        "Adriana: Well, when a biological parent exercises their right to stay anonymous, then --",
        "Michael: The health care provider generally will black out the name of the patient. It's a very standard practice.",
        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "Michael: It happens all the time.",
        "Marcie: Well, ok. \"Psychosis\" -- what does that mean? I mean, what does -- what does that mean for Tommy?",
        "Michael: Honey, I -- I haven't finished reading the file. I -- I can't say what anything means for Tommy.",
        "Marcie: Oh, I'm sorry. I -- go ahead.",
        "Michael: No, it's fine.",
        "Marcie: Maybe this is why Tommy's mom had to give him up. You know, she probably wasn't fit to raise a child in -- in her condition.",
        "Rex: It's possible.",
        "Marcie: What about the dad, you know? I mean, do we know anything about him? Was -- was he normal?",
        "Rex: As far as I could tell. But I'm not a doctor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm having Todd's baby. We're going to get back together.",
        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "Blair: I mean, we're moving in that direction anyway, I mean, because of the trial and the kids.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please, would you knock it off? Jack can't stand to be anywhere near Todd.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no, no. You're so wrong about that, aunt Dorian. Because I had a very long conversation with Jack, explaining to him how Spencer had tried to fool him -- fooled all of us.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Blair: Because of that, he and- Jack and his daddy have reconnected.",
        "Dorian: Well.",
        "Blair: Jack even told Todd that he loved him, and you should've -- it meant so much to Todd. It meant so much to all of us.",
        "Dorian: I'm glad that poor little boy has had some form of closure in all this.",
        "Blair: That's one thing Todd and I did do right was our kids.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Blair: If I could just give him this gift, then he would forgive me.",
        "Dorian: For sleeping with Spencer?",
        "Blair: Don't say it. Don't even think it.",
        "Dorian: What does it matter? Oh, stop that! It doesn't matter what I say, what I think, ok? It's up to you to face facts. Now, please, would you just do the math?",
        "Blair: Well, why don't you just back off? What do you want -- ok, fine, Dorian! I think there's a possibility I could be pregnant with Spencer's child. Are you happy?",
        "Dorian: Where's that nurse?",
        "Blair: Dorian -- Spencer manipulated me for months.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Blair: He manipulated my kids. What do you want me to tell Jack and Starr? \"That man who tortured us, sent your father to death row.\" You want me to keep on going here?",
        "Dorian: No, honey. Just, please, I don't want you worrying about this when -- I just don't. Look, if you are pregnant -- well, then we'll just face this thing together as a family, because Spencer's gone.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Dorian: He is out of your life.",
        "Blair: No, no. See, that's where you're wrong, Dorian. If I am pregnant with Spencer's baby, I'll lose Todd forever.",
        "Dorian: Blair, darling, I know exactly what you're going through.",
        "Blair: How can you?",
        "Dorian: Are you forgetting about Manuel Santi?",
        "Blair: Don't tell me you're going to bring this man up right now?",
        "Dorian: Of course I am, because it's very relevant.",
        "Blair: How?",
        "Dorian: When I found out that I was pregnant with Manuel's baby -- talk about \"sociopath\" -- I was terrified. I mean, what -- what about my future, and what about the baby's?",
        "Blair: Are we going to talk about my possible pregnancy here or are we going to talk about you?",
        "Dorian: We're going to talk about the fact that I made the only decision I could make in order to keep my baby safe.",
        "Blair: You don't even know if I'm pregnant yet. You know, I'm having headaches. Big deal. But I'm late, so it makes sense that I could be pregnant.",
        "Dorian: Right. And sometimes stress can change a woman's cycle, so we can't be sure.",
        "Blair: Right, right, right. So we don't even know yet. Just wait till we get the blood test back.",
        "Dorian: If you are pregnant, I really would rather that it was Todd's baby than Spencer Truman's.",
        "Blair: Would you do me a favor, Dorian, and just leave Todd alone, and do not mention Spencer in this room again, please?",
        "Dorian: Blair? You know, I kind of hope that you are pregnant.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Dorian: Because then it would mean that there's nothing wrong with your brain. And I would rather you gave birth to the devil's baby than risk losing you.",
        "Blair: Well, I'll tell you this, Dorian -- if I'm pregnant with Spencer's baby, it would definitely be the devil's child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Did the prisoner seem chatty to you, or was he quiet? Was he looking around?",
        "Officer: He was quiet.",
        "Bo: Quiet, huh? All right, after this incident, did you see anything that would indicate that maybe he was waiting for someone to spring him?",
        "Officer: No.",
        "Antonio: I may have a couple more questions for you.",
        "Bo: Looks like there was one assailant --",
        "Antonio: Yes.",
        "Bo: A male.",
        "Antonio: Same story over here.",
        "Bo: Ok, no injuries, so I figured this guy must've used a drug or something.",
        "Antonio: Chloroform -- I actually smelt it on my guy.",
        "Bo: Ah. Well, whoever it was, he sure knew the route for this van, and he knew what time that it was going to be right here.",
        "Officer: We blocked off the road for a mile in each direction.",
        "Bo: All right. Could you search the area, see if you can find anything that would tell us how this guy is moving Truman right now, what direction they may be headed?",
        "Officer: You got it.",
        "Bo: Thank you.",
        "Antonio: Oh, I just spoke to the station. They're questioning Spencer Truman's attorney as we speak. I'm going to start a list of close friends and associates.",
        "Bo: Somebody stuck their neck out to bust Truman loose. Why?",
        "Antonio: I don't know. Maybe he paid somebody off, extorted a favor. I mean, from the reports I've read, it seems like blackmail seems to be Spencer Truman's favorite M.O. makes him feel like he's in control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: You know, Manning, you wanted Margaret and that child out of the picture anyway. I was doing you a favor, not just because you didn't want Blair to find out about the child! I mean, Margaret was just so monstrous, wasn't she, so unbalanced. So you had to be worried about her. You had to be worried that she was going to pass her own psychosis on to her kid through the D.N.A., right?",
        "Todd: Tell me where he is!",
        "Spencer: Just think about it, Todd. Think about it. Think about Starr, think about Jack. I mean, you really just need to think before you do something really stupid.",
        "Todd: Were you thinking about Hugh before you committed murder?",
        "Spencer: What?",
        "Todd: Oh, that's right -- you didn't know you had a kid before you committed murder, did you, until it was too late? I'm going to give you five seconds. One -- in the knee -- two -- in the other kn -- three, four, five -- [Todd laughs]",
        "Spencer: You can't do it, can you? You can't kill me, can you, Todd? You just can't pull the trigger. I guess I'm still holding all the cards after all, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Wait!",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Adriana: You can't have this file.",
        "Marcie: Why -- why not?",
        "Rex: Adriana, what --",
        "Adriana: You haven't made copies of this yet.",
        "Rex: Right! How did I forget?",
        "Adriana: Brilliant investigator, terrible administrator. I will just -- um -- run to the all-night copy place next door, and I'll make copies. I'll be right back, ok?",
        "Marcie: What --",
        "Rex: I am so sorry about that. I was in such a rush to tell you that I forgot to make cop--",
        "Michael: Look at me. Look at me, look at me. Do not apologize.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Come on. You know how grateful we are to you. You know, when we hired you to find Tommy's birth parents, you were already working for Todd, and -- and I know that he's paying you a lot more than -- than we could ever afford, and -- and you still managed to make us the priority, Rex, so --",
        "Rex: It's not about the money.",
        "Michael: Oh, you know, it's -- it's actually pretty obvious this isn't just a case to you. You know, you really seem to care about Tommy.",
        "Rex: Well, I've never had a Godson before. I know it's t nearly as important as being a father. But I really love that little guy. I just want to make sure I do everything I can to give him an awesome life.",
        "Marcie: You've already done more than enough. So, the birth mom's file -- I mean, did you pretty much read through the whole thing?",
        "Michael: I did.",
        "Marcie: And her mental illness, you know, can -- can it be passed on?",
        "Michael: Listen, in my -- in my medical experience, yes. In my knowledge of this particular area, yes. A genetic predisposition for mental illne can be passed from generation to generation. But that doesn't necessarily mean that Tommy will ever develop any condition within his lifetime. [Phone rings] Ooh, it's Natalie. I got to take it.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Michael: Yeah? What's up?",
        "Marcie: I think my husband was trying to make me feel better. What do you think?",
        "Rex: He was in doctor mode. I think he thought he was being straightforward.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. But he was saying that Tommy could be mentally ill. I mean, not necessarily, but he was saying that it could happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Something's wrong -- my tumor's back.",
        "Dorian: We don't know that.",
        "Blair: What's taking so long? [Blair sighs]",
        "Dorian: Blair, honey, have you experienced any other symptoms that would indicate that you're pregnant?",
        "Blair: What are you doing? Are you playing doctor now? Look, I -- I'm late. You said it could be stress, right?",
        "Dorian: Recently, have your cycles been regular?",
        "Blair: Dorian, I've had two kids, I've been pregnant more than that, I know what a pregnancy feels like. Of course, it doesn't feel like when Jack --",
        "Dorian: Oh, here you are, doctor, at long last.",
        "Blair: Just ignore her.",
        "Doctor: I'm Dr. Hansen, the hematologist brought in to consult.",
        "Blair: So, give it to me straight. My tumor back?",
        "Dr. Hansen: You've experienced a surge of hormones due to the increased blood volume circulating throughout your body.",
        "Blair: What does that mean?",
        "Dorian: Blair, it means you're pregnant.",
        "Dr. Hansen: Congratulations, Ms. Cramer, you are between 15 and 17 weeks pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: We both know that you can't kill me.",
        "Todd: Why don't I soften you up?",
        "Spencer: You lost a bluff, Manning. No -- ah, come on, agh! Son of a bitch. I called your bluff, you lost! The cops are on their way right now to take me to \"Wing nut-dale\" and arrest you for assault, kidnapping, whatever else they can throw your sorry ass in jail for!",
        "Todd: Cops couldn't find their butts if it had a bell on it. Nobody knows where you are or who took you. It's like you fell off the face of the earth, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: Huh. Yeah, but they'll find me. Because they think I'm a cop killer, remember? I am very, very important to them right now, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'd like to play a game. What's it called? Oh, yes, the -- the \"how should Todd Manning torture information about his son out of Spencer Truman\" game.",
        "Spencer: You are insane.",
        "Todd: Maybe. I'll start. How about this -- how about I shoot you in the hands, both hands, and then you'll never operate on anybody again? Ok, your turn. Tick-tock-tick-tock- tick-tock-tick-tock- tick-tock-tick -- [Todd imitates buzzer] Back to me? Ok. You burn your hands. That would be poetic justice, wouldn't it, for my niece, whose boyfriend, John Mc Bain, is suffering in a burn facility?",
        "Spencer: What is this obsession you have with my hands, man? Oh, I know -- is it because you just can get the image out of your head of me running my fingers all over every inch -- every inch of Blair's body, as I make love to her over and over and over and over again? [Spencer laughs] That's it, isn't it? You just can't get it out of your mind, can you, Todd?",
        "Todd: Where's my son?",
        "Spencer: How should I know?",
        "Todd: Wrong answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Sorry we didn't find more.",
        "Bo: No, no, no, this helps a lot. Good work. Thank you.",
        "Antonio: Any luck with the tracks?",
        "Bo: Whoever hijacked the transport took Spencer right off through the woods. Now, there's a little trail back there, a little path, and it runs at an angle right back to this road.",
        "Antonio: Well, it sounds like our guy had a car waiting for him.",
        "Bo: We got C.S.U. They're looking for any tread marks, oil drips -- that stuff. That's a long shot.",
        "Antonio: Well, we got to try everything.",
        "Bo: Ok, what about Truman's family, friends?",
        "Antonio: I -- I just got off the phone with the station. Blair's out of the question, David's in California.",
        "Bo: Yeah, David, he -- he hates Truman as much as Blair does.",
        "Antonio: Well, that's it as far as friends and -- and family are concerned. Colleagues and associates have been accounted for. Look, I'll keep digging. I mean, he's got to have an ally out there that we don't know about.",
        "Bo: I don't know -- I'm t so sure, you know? John and I did a whole workup of all of Spencer's associates that may have helped him set me up, and I think we hit just about everybody.",
        "Antonio: All right. What are you thinking?",
        "Bo: Ahem. Truman was handcuffed in the back of this van. Now, the guard -- he had the key up there in his pocket. Our guy could've gotten to that key.",
        "Antonio: All right. Well, maybe -- maybe he panicked, decided he needed to make a quick getaway?",
        "Bo: No, but the guards -- they were out cold, all right? They couldn't even make a distress call. So our perp -- he could've easily gotten that key and he could've uncuffed Truman.",
        "Antonio: I don't get it. I mean, why try to help someone escape if you're purposely going to keep him restrained?",
        "Bo: Something doesn't fit.",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Start talking.",
        "Spencer: What are you doing? You're nuts, you know that? We both know you can't kill me! I'm the only person on God's green earth that knows where your kid is! You can't let me take that to the grave. Hell, you can't even let them lock me up in \"wing nut-dale\" without busting me loose. All right, look -- come on, man. Look, we both know that you can't kill me. Hell, I'm starting to think that you can't even hurt me. As you know, I will be found, and then you will be exposed for the sadistic bastard that you are.",
        "Todd: There won't be anything to expose. I figured out a way to torture you without leaving a mark.",
        "Spencer: Oh, yeah? What are you going to do, talk me to death?",
        "Todd: No. Easy. Trust me, when I'm done with you, you'll be begging to tell me everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: All right. Look at this -- 15 to 17 weeks. All right. Count backwards, one -- yes! It covers the one time that Todd and I made love after he got out of prison.",
        "Dorian: You write stuff like that down?",
        "Blair: Yes, I do, because it's important, and I can take it back to the minute. I've been holding on that for the last three months. Because every time Todd would -- every time that we had a fight, I'd just close my eyes and remember that he still loved me.",
        "Dorian: Honey, I hate to be a killjoy, but are you telling me that you and Todd only made love once during that whole time?",
        "Blair: Don't start, please? Dorian Dr. Hansen gave us a window of 15 to 17 weeks. You and Spencer were still --",
        "Blair: Look it, I can only have this baby if it's Todd's. It can't be Spencer's, all right?",
        "Dorian: We better find out so you can weigh your options.",
        "Blair: It is Todd's -- even if it's not.",
        "Dorian: Blair, you know, you're only avoiding the subject with all this domesticity.",
        "Blair: Dorian, I am not avoiding anything. I'm just trying to take care of my body now that I know that I'm pregnant.",
        "Dorian: All right, fine. But I think you should also take care of your heart and your mind. Hmm?",
        "Blair: Thank you. That's what I intend to do.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: By telling Todd the baby is his, even if it turns out to be Spencer's. I'm -- Blair -- it's not going to work.",
        "Blair: Well, I think it's a perfect idea.",
        "Dorian: Look, Todd may be many, many awful things, but he's not stupid, ok? He can add. And once you tell him that you're pregnant, it's going to occur to him that it could possibly be with another man's child, and that -- not just another man. We're talking about his worst enemy, a man who tried --",
        "Blair: Ok, would you spare me the recap here, because I'm living this nightmare, thank you very much.",
        "Dorian: Ok, let me remind you of another nightmare that you lived through -- Max Holden.",
        "Blair: Oh -- oh, please. You going to bring him up?",
        "Dorian: Yes!",
        "Blair: That was 80 years ago, and Jack ended up being Todd's, so there.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but we didn't know that then, and Todd thought that Jack was -- was Max's. And so he took the baby away from you, told you the baby was dead, gave the baby away to someone else.",
        "Blair: It was a completely different situation.",
        "Dorian: Oh, but history has a way of repeating itself when it comes to Todd Manning.",
        "Blair: History -- that's what it is. Todd and I have put that behind us. We've moved on, we've had a -- a life of our own, we built a family, and we were getting ready to be remarried until the dynamic duo, demon team came into town.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you're talking about Margaret and Spencer.",
        "Blair: Yes, I'm talking about Margaret Cochran and, thank God, she's dead. It's killing Todd to know that he has a -- a son out there somewhere, and God knows what's going on with him.",
        "Dorian: How will you feel if Todd finds that baby?",
        "Blair: I don't know. It'll -- it'll be tough, I mean, at first, I'm sure, but it's -- it's Jack and Starr's half brother. It's Todd's baby and -- well, I will learn to love him like my own. But the problem here is Spencer's never going to tell us where that baby is. Of course, Rex has hit some kind of roadblock.",
        "Dorian: Rex couldn't find snow in Alaska.",
        "Blair: I just want to give Todd this baby. It'll be our gift, you know, conceived in love? Who knows, you know? Todd's other child -- it might be gone for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Rex: Thanks for taking care of that for me.",
        "Adriana: No problem.",
        "Michael: Well, good news -- my brother came out of surgery, he's awake, and he is doing great.",
        "Marcie: Oh, thank God.",
        "Adriana: Oh, that's so great, Michael.",
        "Rex: Yes, I am really happy to hear that.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Yeah, me, too. I've had my head so wrapped up in this Truman thing that I kind of lost sight of what's important, you know? I mean, I just found out my brother's doing really great. And finding out about Tommy's birth parents and -- you know, it -- it's really apparent to me right now that what's important in life is taking care of the people that you love, you know? Not seeking vengeance.",
        "Marcie: Michael, this says that Tommy's mother was -- she was really sick.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I know --",
        "Marcie: What do we do about that?",
        "Michael: I know what it says, and what we do is we file that in the back of our minds, and we basically let Tommy be the perfectly wonderful, healthy boy that he's been since we got him.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but what if he doesn't stay healthy and happy?",
        "Michael: Look, honey --",
        "Marcie: What do we do then?",
        "Michael: Honey, listen. With any child, there's a risk, ok? I mean -- I mean, with any birth -- birth is unbelievably risky. Life is even more risky. So what we do is we take the cards we've been dealt and we play the hand.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but, Michael, what if he gets sick and I don't know how to handle it? I --",
        "Michael: Honey -- honey, listen to me. We love Tommy this much. Right?",
        "Marcie: Yes.",
        "Michael: I can guarantee you one thing. There will never be a more protected boy in this world. Because we have this information, you know, and we keep our eyes open, and we deal with whatever comes up. You believe me, right?",
        "Marcie: Yes, of course. Yes, I believe you.",
        "Michael: Because Tommy is more than just the makeup of his genetic parts, you know? He's his own little person, you know? He's a beautiful little guy, and he's going to need love and caring for the rest of his life.",
        "Marcie: I know that, and I know that Tommy is the same little boy that he was before we got this file. You know I love him. I mean, I love him so much that it hurts sometimes.",
        "Michael: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Marcie: So, this is good, right? I mean, this is good. We have this information. Like you said, it's going to help us to keep him as safe as possible. And I know that we made the right decision -- you know, getting Rex to find out this information for us, so thank you. Really, Rex, we appreciate it so much.",
        "Rex: I made the right decision, too.",
        "Marcie: I know you did. Yeah, and Todd is a complete idiot, because I know that you would've found his son for him. I do.",
        "Michael: I personally wouldn't worry too much about Todd Manning. You know, from what I know about this guy, he's going to find his kid, one way or another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: How's your head?",
        "Spencer: Fine.",
        "Todd: Good. I was worried. Because I figured after all the banging you did on it in jail, that you might have a serious concussion.",
        "Spencer: I'm still here.",
        "Todd: Can I tell you something? You were brilliant. It worked like a charm, and you got your mistrial, sent away to the funny farm to get all patched up with arts and crafts and bogus shrink session.",
        "Spencer: I thought you might be impressed. Yeah, I like those shrinks, Todd. I got a really hot one, and you know all about her, don't you?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, Wingdale -- it's not going to be so bad, I don't think.",
        "Todd: No?",
        "Spencer: I heard they have fingerpaints.",
        "Todd: Fingerpaints? Huh. I could do some fingerpainting, I bet. Hmm. Well -- oh, I got a question for you. Did you know that Chinese water torture did not originate in china?",
        "Spencer: You can't be serious.",
        "Todd: Oh, I'm very serious. I mean, I know it's kind of cliche, but like I said before, I can't leave a mark, and I got other stuff to do, and this takes care of itself. So, here's how it's going to work. Let's see. I'm going to drip water on your head -- on your forehead, to be precise -- very slowly. One little drop at a time. Let's see. Oh. That's perfect. Now, here's what's going to happen to you. It's going to become very irritating to you -- yeah, see, it already is. And then you're going to start to anticipate every drop -- hut! Oh -- hut! [Todd laughs] Right?",
        "Spencer: Yeah.",
        "Todd: And then you're just going to start to dread it -- you know, the anticipation, the tension, the waiting, right? And then panic is going to set in and it's going to grab you by the throat, buddy. And then sooner or later, you are going to go stark-raving mad. What do you think of that?",
        "Spencer: I think you should've done your research, is what I think. This kind of torture only works if you let it, man. And I ain't going to let it, Todd.",
        "Todd: No?",
        "Spencer: Uh-uh.",
        "Todd: All right, we'll see. Ta-ta.",
        "Spencer: You are an idiot. [Door closes] This is so stupid. Huh. No way. Ha- ha. Jeez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Who's the best?",
        "Rex: I don't know.",
        "Marcie: You are. Come here, you little lughead.",
        "Rex: Give Tommy a squeeze for me.",
        "Marcie: I will. So, come on. Let's go home to our perfect, beautiful, healthy son.",
        "Michael: Hey, guys? I just wanted to thank you again. I mean, really, from the bottom of both of our hearts. Thanks.",
        "Rex: No problem.",
        "Marcie: Bye.",
        "Adriana: See you later.",
        "Rex: Thank you for the save. If they had seen Todd's name on that file, I would be --",
        "Adriana: You know, Michael's right. Todd's going to do whatever he can to find his son.",
        "Rex: Then I have to make sure he stops looking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: This baby is Todd's. I would know it if it weren't.",
        "Dorian: You didn't know you were pregnant. Blair, I hate to say this, but your instincts have been questionable for sometime.",
        "Blair: Yeah -- since Margaret Cochran came to town. She's gone now.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Blair: Todd and I are going to finish what we started two years ago. We're going to put our family back together again.",
        "Dorian: You can't just ignore the situation. You have got to find out who the baby's father is.",
        "Blair: Well. Then I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: An A.P.B. has gone out across the tri-state area. Truman's not going to get too far.",
        "Bo: Think about those handcuffs. I'm not so sure that Truman was rescued by a friend.",
        "Antonio: So, what, you think an enemy broke him out?",
        "Bo: Maybe. I think somebody who's not satisfied with him going to a mental facility instead of a Maximum-security prison.",
        "Antonio: Well, that's just going to make our job harder. I mean, everyone in this town hates the guy.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but there's a handful of people that hate him enough to put their own freedom on the line.",
        "Todd: You guys talking about me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: This is absurd.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "John: What's going on, Cris?",
        "Natalie: Spencer's not going into prison for killing your father.",
        "Marty: What happened to Spencer?",
        "Bo: One of his enemies has already gone after him.",
        "Blair: This baby can't be Spencer's. It's got to be Todd's.",
        "Jessica: Why don't you stay?"
