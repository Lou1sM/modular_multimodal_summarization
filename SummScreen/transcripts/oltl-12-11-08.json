        "Everybody goes to Hope's funeral. Marty is overwhelmed knowing that her son lost his baby but he had it with Todd Manning's daughter. And she remembers believing Todd's lie that Starr asked Todd and Marty to raise their baby together. She tells Reverend Carpenter she wants to hurt Todd the way he hurt her. Nora tells Todd she will offer him a deal of a reduced sentence in order to spare Marty the agony of a trial. He does not agree but still affirms that he loves Marty. Blair notices that Jack is not dealing well with the lies everybody told him about his father and the conflicting stories he reads online. Tea admits to the Vegas that she plans to represent Todd. Antonio, Carlotta and Talia tell her they don't approve of that. But she plans to do it anyway. Sara cannot accept the fact that Vanessa is manipulating Cristian and obviously has romantic interest in him."

        "Guard: What are you looking at, Manning, your girlfriend? You're all over the papers, you freak.",

        "Cole: Mom, I didn't think you were coming.",
        "Marty: Well, I thought about it. And I decided I wasn't going to let that son of a bitch Todd Manning keep me from being here with my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Langston?",
        "Langston: Lola?",
        "Lola: Hide me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Better get a move on, Vanessa. You don't want to be late for your deportation hearing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Hey, guys?",
        "Antonio: Hmm?",
        "Carlotta: I want to introduce you to Noelle. She's our new waitress. This is my son Antonio. He's the new chief of detectives.",
        "Noelle: Oh, your mama told me that you were important, but chief of detectives?",
        "Antonio: It's just a job.",
        "Talia: Hey, it is a big job. And my name's Talia.",
        "Noelle: Hi.",
        "Talia: Nice to meet you.",
        "Noelle: You, too.",
        "Carlotta: Talia's also a police officer. She's his girlfriend, and she's got a lot of commendations and awards and ribbons, and we're very proud of her.",
        "Talia: Whoa, your mom should be the new press rep down at the station.",
        "Carlotta: Please, I'm just trying to get the restaurant up and running.",
        "Noelle: And don't tell my fianc\u00e9, but it's even nicer than the Bon-Jour.",
        "Carlotta: Really?",
        "Noelle: I mean, the Buenos --",
        "T\u00e9a: Buenos Dias? I turn my back for six years, and you redo my diner?",
        "Carlotta: T\u00e9a Delgado! Ay dios, mija!",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "Carlotta: Let me look at you. What are you doing in Llanview?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hey, friend? I got this, okay?",
        "Guard: All right.",
        "Nora: Thanks.",
        "Nora: Todd, I'm going to make you an offer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Talia Sahid, T\u00e9a Delgado --",
        "Talia: Hi.",
        "Antonio: Dear friend of the family's.",
        "Carlotta: Yes, friend of the family who we haven't seen in about, what, six years? Where have you been, young lady?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, everywhere. I'm an attorney, specializing in international law.",
        "Carlotta: So, spill. You here on a case, or what?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you know me, I'm always working. But not today. Today is \u0096",
        "T\u00e9a and Carlotta: Vega day.",
        "[T\u00e9a and Carlotta laugh]",
        "T\u00e9a: I missed you guys so much.",
        "Carlotta: Ah. You only missed my flan.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's true, I only missed your flan, but my tailor didn't miss your flan.",
        "Antonio: So, what are you doing here in Llanview, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you're the chief of detectives. You tell me.",
        "Antonio: You're here to represent Todd Manning, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I thought you were going to throw the book at me.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I could, but I really want to take care of the people I care about.",
        "Todd: So that means you have a heart. Huh.",
        "Nora: Listen, this is the deal. You plead guilty to everything you did to Marty, and I will recommend 25 years in a minimum-security facility. No possibility of parole, though.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: 25, huh?",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Todd: Doesn't sound like much of a deal to me.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, we'll go to trial, and you'll get life.",
        "Todd: Why are you settling at 25, Nora?",
        "Nora: For Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Mom, this is -- this is Starr. Todd is --",
        "Marty: Her father, I know. Forgive me if I offended you.",
        "Starr: No, I agree. I've been dealing with my dad my whole life and I know what he's -- what he does to people. If it helps at all, I don't think he understood what he was doing. He can't help but to lie to everyone about everything. But to lie to you when you lost your memory, it was just the worst, and I am very sorry for that.",
        "Marty: It's okay. I'm so sorry for Hope.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Marty: She was aptly named. Look at us, we've all lost Hope.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: She was our granddaughter.",
        "Blair: Yes, she was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: I thought we'd start with an omelette de fromage, Jack, served with a medley of fresh fruits and yam frites. That's French fries.",
        "Jack: I don't care what you call it. It looks like a pile of crap to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You want me to hide you? From what?",
        "Lola: Immigration.",
        "Langston: What happened? I thought Dorian's lawyers were going to fix things.",
        "Lola: Vanessa talked to them, but they said they couldn't fix anything. She has to go to court for some deportation thing.",
        "Langston: A hearing?",
        "Lola: Everyone's pretending like there's going to be some kind of change, and you know what? We're going to have to stay, but I know it's a lie. They're going to send her back, which means I'm going to get sent back, too. And I don't want to go back. I want to stay here with you and Markko where's it's safe and I don't feel scared all the time. Just, please, let me just stay and just hide me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sarah --",
        "Vanessa: No, she's right. If I have any chance of staying in this country, I can't be late for the judge.",
        "Cristian: We have plenty of time, don't worry. I was planning on going by the diner and getting breakfast anyway.",
        "Sarah: Oh, thanks. I'd love breakfast.",
        "Vanessa: Um, I'll be just a minute.",
        "Cristian: What's your problem?",
        "Sarah: If I hadn't been there -- she just wants you out of that towel.",
        "Cristian: No, she doesn't.",
        "Sarah: Cristian, open your eyes. I mean, it's obvious. She wants you. Do you want her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Look, I know it's scary dealing with lawyers and judges, and maybe having to go back home, but --",
        "Lola: I don't have a home. We've been moving around since my father was arrested.",
        "Langston: Okay, but all I'm saying is, hiding from cops from immigration? That's no answer. Trust me, I've been there.",
        "Lola: Langston, you don't understand. I will do anything to stay, anything. Just, just, please, hide me.",
        "Langston: Okay. Let's get out of here.",
        "Lola: Really, you'll help me?",
        "Langston: Yeah. Let's go.",
        "Lola: I knew you wouldn't let me down.",

        "Addie: Jack Manning, what was that?",
        "Jack: Well, it sure wasn't breakfast.",
        "Moe: Not anymore it isn't.",
        "Addie: Mr. Stubbs cooked you a beautiful meal.",
        "Jack: Grownups eat that stuff, not kids. And who the hell is Mr. Stubbs?",
        "Addie: Mr. Stubbs is this gentleman whom you've just offended. Now, you lower your voice and apologize.",
        "Jack: I'm not apologizing to anybody, ever.",
        "Addie: I am so sorry, Mr. Stubbs.",
        "Moe: I tried to make it kid friendly and still live up to Dr. Lord's expectations.",
        "Addie: You did a beautiful job. It's just that Jack -- all these children have been through so much the past few weeks. His sister is burying her little baby today. And I think maybe Jack just got lost in the shuffle, as usual.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sarah, I was in that shower with you. Thanks to Vanessa, I am here with you --",
        "Sarah: For five minutes. We were in the shower for five minutes, and she was throwing herself on the door. We haven't even had one night alone since --",
        "Cristian: What do you call last night?",
        "Sarah: A nightmare. We couldn't sleep, we couldn't fight, we couldn't make love. I -- I shouldn't have even stayed here.",
        "Vanessa: I'm ready to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I saw Todd.",
        "Carlotta: Que estas pensando?",
        "Antonio: Si estas aqui para defenderlo.",
        "Talia: Guys -- can you please speak in English, honey?",
        "T\u00e9a: Antonio, I'm a lawyer. That's what I do. I defend people who've been accused of crimes, but before you start jumping to conclusions --",
        "Antonio: Do you know what he did, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: I know what the state is alleging he did.",
        "Antonio: He held Marty Saybrooke in a house, kept her from her family. He lied to her, and he had sex with her.",
        "Talia: Which, in his case, means it was rape.",
        "T\u00e9a: If the state is able to prove its case, he'll be punished. But until that time, Todd has the right to be defended by an attorney.",
        "Carlotta: Yes, but why you, T\u00e9a? I mean, you know him. You know all of the terrible things he's done.",
        "Antonio: And don't bring your history into this.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're the only one invoking history. Prior bad acts are usually not admissible, by the way.",
        "Antonio: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm.",
        "Antonio: Prior bad acts with the same victim? You might want to brush up on your law books.",
        "T\u00e9a: And if Todd claims it was consensual?",
        "Antonio: And you believe him?",
        "T\u00e9a: What I believe is immaterial.",
        "Antonio: Of course. You're just doing your job.",
        "Talia: Is she for real?",
        "T\u00e9a: Antonio, this is not the first time you and I have been on opposite sides of a case, and we've been able to remain friends.",
        "Talia: T\u00e9a, is it? I don't think you understand. We were there when Marty was found. If you had seen the look on her face when she realized what he had done, that he'd lied to her, it was rape. And I don't think she's ever going to recover.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Poor, sweet child. You deserve so much more. I wanted to be here with all of you, but I think I've made a mistake, so I'm going to go for a walk.",
        "Cole: I'll go with you.",
        "Marty: You need to be here for Starr, and I'll be fine.",
        "Cole: Mom, you seem upset.",
        "Marty: We're all upset. It's a very sad day. But you need to say your goodbyes. I'll be fine. I'll see you in a little bit. And you, you're even prettier than your picture.",
        "Cole: John, should I go after her?",
        "John: She wants to be on her own, Cole. Sometimes, you got to trust that. Her being here today, that was a big step for her.",
        "Blair: How about we all go back to Dorian's for some lunch?",
        "Cole: Thanks, but I think I'm going to stay here for a while.",
        "Blair: Well, um, we'll be home all day, if you guys want to stop by.",
        "John: Hey, you mind if I stick around?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: As much as I'd like to put you on the stand, oh, boy, would I -- but I really would rather see Marty move on with her life. So, here's the deal. You take it, and together, we can make sure that Marty doesn't have to testify in open court. Oh, God, don't tell me you're getting off on all of this, are you? Seeing her face plastered in all the papers? The two of you combined together, with what they're saying, \"frat boy strikes again\" --",
        "Todd: I get the point.",
        "Nora: Well, then come on, Todd. Take the deal. It's getting worse. Do you know that the TV stations are now suing to have cameras in the courtroom? Yeah, can you imagine that? There's Marty on the stand with a camera in her face, while your attorney rips her apart.",
        "Todd: I never meant to hurt her.",
        "Nora: Then don't hurt her anymore. Stop the pain. Take the deal, plead guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I don't remember you. I don't remember anyone. Uh -- but if -- if you remember me -- I think I need a little help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Talia, I'm sorry that Marty felt so violated. Truly, I am, but that doesn't change the fact that Todd, that any defendant, deserves the right to an attorney.",
        "Antonio: And it has to be you?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, it doesn't have to be me, but I was here, and I offered.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I know that you think that Todd Manning is damaged goods, that he can't help what he does. But you're wrong. He knows exactly what he's doing. He played this like a mastermind. He took advantage of Marty Saybrooke's memory loss, and now he's taken advantage of you and your soft spot for him.",
        "T\u00e9a: What soft spot?",
        "Antonio: You've always had a thing for him --",
        "T\u00e9a: Just because I was married to the man several years --",
        "Antonio: To pull off another one of his schemes.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I divorced him for cause. That somehow disqualifies me?",
        "Antonio: I never said that.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, you didn't. You just know that I'm good, and you don't want me to represent him. Well, not to worry, I'm not, so get off my back.",
        "Antonio: You're not?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. He turned down my offer to represent him. He doesn't want to be defended. He thinks he deserves to be punished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What are you looking for, Todd?",
        "Todd: Nothing.",
        "Nora: Nothing? No time? You held a woman hostage.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know what I did. No matter what the court says, I'm going to have to live with it.",
        "Nora: Oh, so you're sorry for what you've done?",
        "Todd: What, does it matter?",
        "Nora: Oh, come on. What do you want -- what do you want from me, sympathy?",
        "Todd: I've already lost everything I want -- my kids.",
        "Nora: You didn't lose them, you pushed them away. If you cared about your kid, if you cared at all about your children, let alone Marty, you would stop this insanity right now. Do you know what it's like to grow up in this town with you as a father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: He threw his plate in the fireplace? Jack?",
        "Moe: He's got a good arm on him.",
        "Blair: But that's not like him. He's not rude.",
        "Starr: Oh, I've seen him throw his math book across the room.",
        "Blair: But to insult Mr. Stubbs like that --",
        "Addie: There's been a lot going on lately. I think maybe Jack's just gotten a little lost.",
        "Moe: I'll just take this to the kitchen.",
        "Blair: What are you saying, Mama? That I've neglected my son?",
        "Addie: No, of course not. But just think of what this family's just been through. His sister's lost her baby, and his father is unavailable at the moment. It takes its toll.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and I wasn't there for him last night, either.",
        "Starr: I'm going to go check on him.",
        "Blair: Starr -- are you okay?",
        "Starr: I'm always okay, Mom. It's my role.",
        "Blair: I could just kill Todd for what he's done to this family, just kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't need your help, Nora, raising my kids.",
        "Nora: Todd, you're not going to see your kids, let alone get a chance to raise them. Have you thought about that at all? How your kids turned out as well as they did, I don't know, that's mind-boggling. Losing you is probably going to be good for them.",
        "Todd: Yes, I'm aware of how much I've hurt my kids, thank you. Actually, Blair was just here the other day. She ran it down for me.",
        "Nora: Well, I can see you've taken it to heart.",
        "Todd: Nora, I fell in love with her. I still love her. Everything I did, all of it, was to help her recover.",
        "Todd: Me and you, and this little baby, we could form a little -- a whacked- out family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andrew: Marty?",
        "Marty: Uh, hello. Do I know you? I'm sorry; you have to help me out here. I have amnesia.",
        "Andrew: My name is Andrew Carpenter, and, um -- well, we knew each other very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Uh -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to --",
        "John: Forget about it.",
        "Cole: I know that's not your sort of thing -- emotion.",
        "John: I'm just not good at it. You know, your mom, she made a real effort today showing up for you.",
        "Cole: Yeah. She keeps telling me that we should try to get to know each other and not worry about who we used to be.",
        "John: Well, that's -- that's one way of looking at it. At least she's trying.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know. I know she's trying. And I know I sound ungrateful. I mean, she's alive, right? That's my kid in that casket -- my daughter.",
        "John: You need your mom.",
        "Cole: Do you know what it feels like to look at my mom and see that she doesn't know who I am?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Andrew Carpenter -- I know you. I mean, I remember you.",
        "Andrew: No. I know -- I know about your injuries and the memory loss. I'm so sorry.",
        "Marty: Thank you. I read about you online in a newspaper article. Ahem. It said that I -- well, I tarnished your reputation with false accusations.",
        "Andrew: That was a long time ago. Really, we got past it.",
        "Marty: Can you do something for me?",
        "Andrew: If I can.",
        "Marty: Can you tell me everything I did to you and why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hello. So I hear you did not like your squab?",
        "Jack: I hate all this French crap.",
        "Blair: Really? Well, I'm not too pleased with your language or your rudeness.",
        "Jack: So?",
        "Blair: \"So\"? Come on, Jack. I think we need to talk about your attitude here.",
        "Jack: I don't have an attitude. I'm just sick of being lied to.",
        "Blair: Who's lying to you?",
        "Jack: You!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You love Marty?",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Nora: Oh, Todd, really. Wow. So when you asked Zach and Powell to keep her in her room so you could rape her, that was love? And then when you convinced them to take turns raping her, that was love?",
        "Todd: That was a long time ago.",
        "Nora: No, but nothing's changed, Todd. Do you see? Nothing's changed. Just last week when John McBain went to your house and found Marty, she was under guard, right? That was love? Was that your love? When you lied to her about who she was? When you told her you were the only one in the world who cared about her, was that a loving thing to do? Keeping her from her son, her friends? When you convinced her that her only option was to let you rape her again, that was love -- that's your love? Is that your love, Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Todd -- Todd said that? He said that he was guilty?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, he apparently feels guilty. Whether or not he pleads guilty remains to be seen, but in any case, he turned down my offer to represent him.",
        "Antonio: Why would you make him an offer in the first place?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would you feel it's your place to tell me who I can and can't represent? Why is that your business?",
        "Cristian: T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh.",
        "Cristian: What a surprise. What are you doing here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Cristian, oh, it's so good to see you.",
        "Cristian: So good to see you. I want to introduce you to someone. This is --",
        "T\u00e9a: I know exactly who she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Vanessa? Vanessa? Good, they're not here. I'll just go get my stuff and we can get out of here.",
        "Langston: We're not going anywhere.",
        "Lola: What do you mean? You have to hide me.",
        "Langston: Well, that's not going to work.",
        "Lola: So you were lying to me in the car? You said you would fix this.",
        "Langston: No, until the authorities tell you that your situation has changed, you're going to have to stay here.",
        "Lola: Langston, Vanessa is going to get deported. You know that, I know that, and I'm going to have to go with her.",
        "Langston: Okay, if that's what they decide, then we'll fight it, but we're not running away and hiding before we even know what's up.",
        "Lola: I'm not staying here.",

I was so scared of child services and what they would do to me that I just pretended my parents were still away on one of their trips. I hid out for almost a year and a half lying to everybody, coming home to an empty house every night. I was so alone. It was terrible.",

        "Langston: No -- Lola, you can't hide any more than I could pretend that my parents were still alive, okay? You have to face this; you have to fight for what you want. Otherwise, your life's not worth living, and I don't want that for you. You're my cousin and I care about you, okay? So, no, you're not hiding -- not now, not ever.",

        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's just that I've known this man since he was a little boy in New York City, and I'm sorry but she's his type. Can I get some backup here? She looks exactly like Roseanne.",

Plead guilty, let her move on with her life -- that would be a loving thing to do, Todd. But you're not going to do that, are you? No, you're not, because this massive love that you're professing to have for her -- it's just another one of your big, fat lies. Fred, I'm done.",

        "Marty: Was I religious?",
        "Andrew: I think \"spiritual\" is probably a better word. You know what you had? You had this belief in a power that was greater than yourself and it was that belief that got you through, you know, so many challenges.",
        "Marty: You mean the rape.",
        "Andrew: Well, that was a terrible time, but you got through it. And you got married, you became a therapist, you had a beautiful son. You were a good wife. You were a great friend.",

I know you're searching for clarity, but if what you're suggesting is that somehow you deserved what happened to you and that somehow your personal growth is the result of Todd's selfish and sick and violent impulses, well, then I'm not going to accept that. You shouldn't accept that. You were a victim. You're the one who had to figure out what happened to you, who had to struggle through it, who had to choose a positive road for your life.",
