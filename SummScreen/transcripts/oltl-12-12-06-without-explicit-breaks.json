        "Spencer curses as he tries to free himself. He vows to kill Todd. His wrists are bloody from trying to damage the structure that holds him, and that water constantly dripping on his forehead is driving him crazy. \"I'm fine! I'm fine!\" he shouts to himself. Soon a bright light has flooded the room. \"You came. I am so glad to see you!\" It is Blair she wears a gold trenchcoat and when she takes it off, she has a skimpy, sexy dress on underneath. She swings her hips as she walks towards him and she undoes his cuffs, kissing him. \"I hate what Todd did to you.\" He is so glad that she hates Todd. They go to a corner in the storage room and fall to the floor to make love It has all been a dream. He has hallucinated the whole thing. No one is there and he is still tied up with duct tape. \"Blair?\" he calls out quietly. No one is there. Todd is at the police station and he is told that Spencer is missing. Todd fakes anger at that. Marty comes to the office and overhears Todd and Bo talking about Spencer. \"What happened to Spencer?\" She learns that he is missing. Bo is interested about why Todd has come there. He says that he came there to ask about what the hell went on in court. He leaves the office now to go. Marty follows him and asks if they can talk for a minute. \"We both have to live in this town, so we have to learn to co-exist.\" He orders her to stay away from him and to keep her kid away from his. Antonio and Bo are watching the two talk through the blinds and their Spidey sense tell them that Todd is all involved in this. They could pick him up as a person of interest, but they decide instead that they can learn more by leaving Todd alone and putting a trace on him. Marty returns to Bo's office, and Antonio looks like he smells something bad when he walks by her and leaves the room. \"I get that a lot,\" she explains. Bo thinks that she shouldn't be surprised. She has come to the station to tell Bo that she has applied for a job there as Profiler and with the way that people have been treating her, she thinks that it would be better if he just teared up her application. \"Are you sure you want me to do that?\" She is. She leaves the office and once alone, Bo gets out her application and reads. Spencer sees Blair again. This time she has a black leather coat on. \"Help me!\" She asks him why she should when she hates him. He reminds her that it is Todd that she hates. She denies it and he chokes her while she struggles It's all a dream, but still he calls for Blair while his hands are not balled up into red little fists. \"Come back Blair!\" he shouts angrily. \"Come back!\""

        "Viki: Well, at least you didn't throw your back out this time.",

        "Antonio: That's wingdale. And he never made it.",

        "Todd: Well, I do now -- you guys told me. So where is he?",
        "[Spencer pants]",
        "Spencer: You're not going to get away with this, todd. I swear to god, I'm going to kill you! And I'll get away with it, too. I'll get away with everything, even murder.",

        "Kelly: Is everything ok with the baby?",
        "Dorian: Well, there's a -- a little problem. Actually, there's a very big problem. Spencer truman --",
        "blair: Oh, now, we don't know anything.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no.",
        "Blair: No, no, we don't know anything yet. But if it is spencer's baby, I -- oh, god, I don't know what I'm going to do.",
        "John: Why isn't truman going to jail?",
        "Cristian: Sorry about that. When -- when I heard you say you were talking to natalie about the trial, I -- I thought you already knew.",
        "John: Last thing I heard before going into surgery was that the judge had dismissed everyone.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, uncle bo said that spencer went nuts or pretended to.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, supposedly truman banged his head against the wall until he bled. And then he used his own blood to write on the wall.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, so the judge did a 180 and had spencer committed to wingdale.",
        "John: How the hell did this happen?",
        "Cristian: Two words -- marty saybrooke.",
        "Marty: Excuse me. I would like to see commissioner buchanan, please.",
        "Officer: The lady who helped truman beat the rap? I doubt he wants to see you.",
        "Todd: I can't believe you guys let him get away. What kind of idiots you got working here?",
        "Bo: Where you been for the last few hours, manning?",
        "Todd: Um -- what, do you think I let him escape? After what he did to screw me over?",
        "Antonio: Well, can you account for your whereabouts?",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, I was -- I was taking pot shots at an inflatable snowman.",
        "Bo: I want a straight answer.",
        "Todd: Yeah, ha-ha. Uh -- I was at \"the sun\" trying to figure out tomorrow's headlines.",
        "Antonio: Anybody see you there?",
        "Todd: Probably.",
        "Bo: Yes or no?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I didn't think I'd need an alibi.",
        "Bo: I think you're going to need an attorney if we find out you had anything to do with truman's disappearance.",
        "Marty: Spencer's disappeared?",
        "Bo: Marty, what brings you here?",
        "Marty: What happened to spencer?",
        "Bo: The van that was taking him to wingdale was hijacked by a masked assailant.",
        "Todd: What the hell you looking at me for? She's the one who is so hot to keep m out of prison.",
        "Marty: Spencer truman is desperately dturbed and he won't run. No, he'll stay here, go after his enemies.",
        "Bo: Unless one of his enemies has already gone after him.",
        "[Christmas music plays]",
        "Viki: No, we have to put the lights on first.",
        "Clint: I know, but do you remember this?",
        "Viki: Yes. Joey made it in camp. We were up to our ears in popsicle stick art that year.",

        "Asa: If we're going to start moaning and crying over christmases past, I'm going to leave.",
        "Renee: Oh, don't give me that, softie. I caught you this morning looking at that photograph, that old photograph of clint and bo sitting on santa's lap?",
        "[Cli laughs]",
        "Clint: Yeah. Wasn't it amazing how much santa looked like asa?",
        "Asa: That's right. Somebody's going to have to take over santa's duties this year, what with all the new little ones bouncing around here.",
        "Renee: Yes, yes, yes. We've got a lot to celebrate this christmas.",
        "Viki: We really do. I wish we were all together, but you're right, renee. It's all working out.",
        "Renee: Oh, nothing short of a miracle.",
        "Clint: And here's jessica.",
        "Viki: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Here's jessica. I was just putting bree up to sleep.",
        "Renee: And where is that gorgeous husband of yours?",
        "Nash: Well, I think I finally got her to settle. Hi.",
        "Renee: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Antonio had to work, so nash brought bree and I home --",
        "viki: Oh.",
        "Jessica: And I invited him to stay.",
        "Viki: Good.",
        "Asa: Why?",
        "Renee: Asa?",
        "Nash: Well, I don't want to barge in on a family thing.",
        "Viki: No, no, no, nash, please. Please stay. You're always welcome here. You're bree's father.",
        "Nash: Thank you. Wow, that's -- that's quite the tree.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my gosh -- my stocking. I've had this since kindergarten. Wow. Who are these for?",
        "Viki: Well, sweetheart, I thought we'd wait till later to put those up, ok?",
        "Antonio: Can you verify that you were at work during spencer truman's disappearance?",
        "Antonio: Can you verify that you were at work during spencer truman's disappearance?",
        "Todd: You want to go through my security tape?",
        "Bo: We've been there and done that.",
        "Todd: You know, I didn't come here to be harassed about something I don't know anything about.",
        "Bo: Why did you come here, manning?",
        "Todd: I wanted to make sure that llanview's finest didn't let another criminal get away with it!",
        "Bo: We'll find truman.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh. Well, hey, speaking of criminals, what's llanview's finest doing about the creep who tried to rape my daughter, cole thornhart?",
        "Marty: Look, I thought that was settled.",
        "Todd: Nothing's settled as long as that son of a bitch is running around free.",
        "Marty: Look, he was on steroids.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes, he was on steroids. And spencer's nuts, so everybody gets a free pass.",
        "Bo: The incident between starr and cole -- that's under investigation.",
        "Todd: Why isn't he in jail?",
        "Bo: Because jail would warrant formal charges.",
        "Todd: So I'm right.",
        "Bo: And if you have a problem with any of this, you should take it up with the officer who's in charge of the case.",
        "Todd: All right. Better warn her I'm coming.",
        "Bo: Manning? Ahem. You know, marty's right. I -- truman might come after you. You better watch your back.",
        "Marty: Todd, wait.",
        "Todd: Marty? Don't try to defend your kid to me ever again.",
        "Marty: No, no, this isn't about cole. This is about you and me.",
        "bo: Hmm, no.",
        "Antonio: Which supports your theory.",
        "Bo: He's mixed up in this.",
        "Antonio: Well, I just wish we had something to hold him.",
        "Bo: No, I think he can do us more use on the outside. I want to put a tail on him. Maybe he'll lead us to truman.",
        "[Spencer pants]",
        "Spencer: Come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh, come on -- I don't have time for this! Ah! Oh, god.",
        "[Spencer pants]",
        "Spencer: This is not going to work on me, manning. This is not going to work on me! You understand? It's not going to work. It's not going to work. It's not going to work. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'fine. Fall, damn it! What --",
        "kelly: If spencer is the father --",
        "blair: He's not. It's impossible.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I wish it were.",
        "Kelly: Look, I don't want to tell you what to do, but I'm speaking from experience. When I got pregnant, I thought it was horrible, it was awful, but look how that turned out -- kevin loves zane like his own son.",
        "Blair: Kelly? We're talking about todd here. He's still mad at me because I turned to spencer in the first place. Spencer got rid of todd's son. Can you imagine what todd would do holding spencer's child?",
        "Kelly: Ooh, I don't even want to think about that.",
        "Blair: Right.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. You'd have to leave llanview. Oh, god. And then I'd be losing both of you.",
        "Blair: No, no -- well, you're not, ok? Because this child is todd's and it's going to bring us together.",
        "Doctor: Blair?",
        "Blair: Hello, dr. Chen.",
        "Dr. Chen: If you're ready, let's get started.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Kelly: Good luck.",
        "Dr. Chen: Just change into this and we'll find out everything we can about your baby.",
        "Blair: All right. Thank you.",
        "Natalie: Marty saybrooke's a shrink.",
        "John: I know who she is. She testified for manning a while back.",
        "Natalie: Look, it's not like spencer's getting away with it altogether. I mean, there's going to be a retrial as soon as the shrinks at wingdale say that he's ok for court. Look, you're going to get your justice, john.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "Natalie: Maybe you'll be well enough then to be there.",
        "Cristian: Evangeline's already prepping for a retrial. She's not going to let this go.",
        "John: Neither am I.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Cristian: That's her now. Maybe she has news. I'll be back.",
        "[John groans]",
        "Natalie: And, john, it's time for your pain medication.",
        "John: I'm fine.",
        "Natalie: I can see that you're in pain.",
        "John: No.",
        "Natalie: I see it in your eyes.",
        "John: Stuff makes me out of it, all right? And I want to -- I want to try to be here, be here with you.",
        "Natalie: I'm surprised that you didn't blow a gasket with this. I really thought you were going to lose it and set back your recovery.",
        "John: I can't do anything right -- right now, not from here. I'm going to have to let other people do it for me.",
        "Natalie: Can you do that, john?",
        "John: Bo, evangeline -- I trust them. Right now, I just want to concentrate on what's important.",
        "Natalie: John, we shouldn't do this. You could get an infection.",
        "John: Doctors don't know everything.",
        "Natalie: If I didn't know any better, I would think you were up to something.",
        "Marty: I know you think I testified on spencer's mental condition as some sort of slap to you. But it wasn't -- it had nothing to do with you. So I hope this business with cole isn't your way of getting back at me.",
        "Todd: I want some justice for my kid, that's all.",
        "Marty: So do I. Hey, like it or not, you and I are livingn the same town again. Our paths are going to cross, so we're going to have to find some way to coexist.",
        "Todd: How about this way -- you stay the hell away from me and make sure your son stays the hell away from starr.",
        "Antonio: Tail all set?",
        "Bo: Done.",
        "Antonio: All right. I'll check back with you later.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Marty: Well, I've been getting that look from everybody today.",
        "Bo: Well, what do you expect, marty?",
        "Marty: I was doing my job.",
        "Bo: Ok. Why don't you have a seat and you can do your job for me right now.",
        "Marty: Well --",
        "bo: Now, spencer truman -- I mean, you know him, right, from a -- a psychological standpoint. Do you think that -- that he would set up his own escape?",
        "Marty: Well, thanks for asking, since everybody else seems to think I'm a vengeful quack.",
        "Bo: Yeah, see, I've read your C.V. I've made a few calls to some of your references in california.",
        "Marty: I don't know whether I should be flattered or insulted.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm just doing my job.",
        "Marty: Well, I guess I must have passed the test if you're asking for my opinion.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: Look, I know everybody thinks spencer was faking it, but he wasn'T. But let's say it was an act. A renowned surgeon like him going to those lengths -- I mean, particularly against todd? Planning and faking margaret's murder, the disappearance of her son? Framing todd for the murders all the way to the death chamber? These are -- these are not acts of a sane man.",
        "Bo: But I'm not denying that he's a sociopath.",
        "Marty: Exactly. I mean, as a doctor, he would know what it means to be found unfit. In prison, he would at least have a chance at parole, but in a mental institution? No, his fate is in the hands of the doctors. He could be there for the rest of his life.",
        "Bo: Yeah, ok, but as a doctor, he could know how to convince them that he's cured.",
        "Marty: Well, then he goes back on trial and is probably found guilty.",
        "Bo: Ok. Let's get back to my original question.",
        "Marty: No, no. I don't think spencer planned his escape. By the way you were questioning todd, I don't think you do, either. You think todd had something to do with this?",
        "Bo: Do you?",
        "Marty: Why are you asking me?",
        "Bo: Because you know todd -- psychologically speaking. I mean, you did an evaluation on him a couple of years ago. Do you think that he was hiding something just now?",
        "Marty: Look, I really don't want to get involved in this.",
        "Bo: Oh. You already are involved in this.",
        "Marty: No, no, no. I -- I cannot weigh in on todd, not with our history.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you told me yourself spencer truman is a dangerous man. Now,f he's out there right now on his own, have to know that. But if he's not -- I mean, if he's out there but there's someone else who is responsible for his situation right now -- see, I have to know that, too.",
        "Marty: Then I think it would be smart to keep an eye on todd.",
        "Dorian: So zane is coming home tonight?",
        "Kelly: Yeah! I'm so excited but I'm terrified.",
        "Dorian: Does this mean you'll be leaving for london soon?",
        "Kelly: Well, I miss kevin and he misses zane. It's important for us to be together. You knew this day would come.",
        "Dorian: I was hoping it was going to be later rather than sooner.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Kelly: You always said yowanted me to be happy.",
        "Dorian: If you can be with kevin.",
        "Kelly: I really think we're going to make it this time. Please be happy for me.",
        "Dorian: Well, I am. I'm -- I'm happy for you. I'm just not happy that you're going to be so far away. I'm sorry. I can't help it.",
        "Kelly: I miss -- I'm going to miss you.",
        "Dorian: I'm going to miss you. Hmm.",
        "Dr. Chen: Excuse me -- dr. Lord?",
        "Dorian: Yes?",
        "Dr. Chen: You can go in now if you'd like.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you, dr. Chen.",
        "Kelly: Right.",
        "Dorian: Ok. How did it go?",
        "Blair: Fine.",
        "Kelly: Are you ok?",
        "Blair: Yeah. So it's going to take about a week for the D.N.A. Test, you know, to be complete. I just don't know if I can wait that long.",
        "Dorian: You're not going to have to because --",
        "blair: What are you talking about?",
        "Dorian: Yeah. I pulled in some favors from back when I was chief of staff here and they're going to get the test result to you in 24 hours.",
        "Blair: Oh, my god. You mean in a day, I'm going to know whether this baby is todd or spencer's?",
        "Spencer: Oh, I can't take much more of this. I got to get out of here.",
        "[Spencer pants]",
        "Spencer: Oh, thank god -- thank god you're here. Rachel ray here",
        "Bo: So do you think todd kidnapped truman, or maybe killed him?",
        "Marty: I am not the one you should be asking about this.",
        "Bo: Can't you give me a straight answer? Just leave the personal out of it?",
        "Marty: Yes, I can, but I --",
        "bo: Ok, well, then do it.",
        "Marty: Ok. Look, I don't know if todd had anything to do with spencer's escape, but there was something that bothered me.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Marty: Todd's reaction when the judge found spencer unfit -- or rather, his lack of a reaction. That's not todd's style.",
        "Bo: I thought the same thing. But look, you didn't come here to talk about todd, so what did you want to talk to me about?",
        "Marty: A job.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, no -- no, thanks for getting back to me so soon. I just need to make sure that it arrives in time. Yeah. Oh, it's for my beautiful wife. And I want to make sure she has the most wonderful christmas she's ever had.",
