        "Evangeline nearly falls over when she gets the news that Todd might be involved with Spencer's disappearance. She shutters when she thinks of what he might be doing to the man. Bo says that Todd had better be careful or he may just end up back on death row. Chris starts drawing a picture and it looks good. He hears someone coming and covers his paining to hide it. Antonio arrives and he asks if Chris is painting again. Cris denies that. Cris is glad to see his brother. He has been thinking about asking Evangeline to marry him but every time that he wants to do it, he changes his mind. He hasn't got money, or a career and he feels he should have something. Antonio tells him that this doesn't matter but Chris can remember a time when Antonio had issues like this with Jessica before he got his trust fund. Antonio admits it but now he knows that life is too short and if you have someone that you love you have to grab on to them. Evangeline comes home later and Cris puts on the music and gets the wine going as he gives Evangeline a massage from head to toe. Bo goes to the hospital and tells Natalie, John and Michael that Spencer has disappeared and that he thinks that someone has run off with the man namely Todd. John smiles. He knew it. He wants the doctors to speed up his recovery so that he can get the hell out of there. Natalie gets angry and tells that he will not be allowed out of there. Michael asked the doctors about a speedier treatment and they said no. John grows restless now. A nurse checks him out and sees that his blood pressure is out of whack. She goes running down the hall to get help from a doctor. John doesn't care. He will convince the doctor to let him out sooner rather than later. Natalie isn't happy but neither she nor Michael can change his mind. Michael goes to talk to the doctors again for his brother and Natalie quietly agrees to help John if she can. \"Just tell me that you are not going to leave me.\" John says nothing. Todd tells Blair that the problems between the both of them has always been secrets and lies. He doesn't want to do that anymore. He tells her that he has something that he has to confess to her. \"I kidnapped Spencer and I am torturing him.\" Blair is stunned. She feels that he has made a terrible mistake and that they should go and release the crazy bastard into woods or something to stop this. Todd can't let the man go free. \"Not until I get my kid!\" Todd figures that Spencer will either tell him where his kid is or go crazy. If he goes nuts then Todd will just call the cops, tell them where Spence is and they will put him in an institution. It's all win-win for him. Blair sees that she can't change Todd's mind, so she offers to help if she can."

        "Natalie: Give me the phone.",
        "John: I'll call you back.",
        "Natalie: Michael, it's Natalie, and no, there will not be any speeding up the process, so forget what he said.",
        "John: He's coming down.",
        "Natalie: Why do you do this?",
        "John: I need to get out of here.",
        "Natalie: And -- and leave before you're healing? I mean, come on, John. Does that make any sense?",
        "John: The doctors wouldn't do it if it was dangerous.",
        "Natalie: So why bother asking? If the doctors thought it was such a swell idea, they would've come up with it themselves.",
        "John: I just want Mike to ask, that's all.",
        "Natalie: Well, he can ask all he wants, but I'm going to tell you right now, I will not let u do anything to jeopardize your recovery. And I don't expect an argument from you because you will lose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I have got a tree tied to the roof of my car. Now, if you go and get it, I'll help you hang ornaments.",
        "Nash: Thank you, but I've had all the Christmas cheer I can handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Bo: Right.",
        "Evangeline: Bo, hi. Sorry to interrupt. I passed Marty Saybrooke on the way in here. Has she decided to rethink her assessment of Spencer's mental state?",
        "Bo: No, it's just the opposite, actually, but that's not the issue right now. We have to find Truman before he hurts someone.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, God, for that bastard to arrange his own escape -- I mean, if anything proves that this so-called psychotic state is a setup, Bo, it's that.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, he may not have escaped.",
        "Evangeline: What?",
        "Bo: We're starting to think that he as abducted -- by Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Oh, damn you, Manning. I will find a way out of here, so help me God, and when I do, you're a dead man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Come on, talk to me. The doctor really gave you a clean bill of health?",
        "Blair: Um -- well, she said that we needed to wait till we get the test results back, but there's definitely no tumor.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh. Know what it is. Yeah, I think I know exactly what's wrong with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Come on, John, you're clearly in pain. Let -- let me do something.",
        "John: Leave it alone, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: I'll hit the morphine pump for you.",
        "John: No.",
        "Natalie: God -- John, this isn't happening. You're supposed to lie here and stay calm. Do you want those second skin grafts to be rejected because do you know how bad that would hurt you?",
        "John: You're not a doctor.",
        "Michael: Yeah. But I am. And I'm on Natalie's side. It's not a good idea to speed up the skin-grafting procedures. There's no shortcut through this, Johnny.",
        "Natalie: There. Believe me now?",
        "John: Mike, I want you to go to the doctors, I want you to talk to them. Just find out if it's possible -- that's all I'm asking. Hmm.",
        "Michael: Okay. I'll talk to your doctors. But if they say no, it's no, Johnny.",
        "Natalie: Happy?",
        "John: Extremely happy. What are you going to do with that? Are you going to give it to me or throw it in my face?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: It's a start.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Cristian: Come in.",
        "Antonio: Hey!",
        "Cristian: Hey. I was expecting Evangeline.",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah. I just saw her at the station as I was leaving.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, I know. I heard about Truman's escape. I don't want her running around.",
        "Antonio: Well, I don't blame you. You painting again?",
        "Cristian: No, no, not really. So, what are you doing here?",
        "Antonio: I -- I came to talk to you about Christmas.",
        "Cristian: The Buchanans and the Vegas spending Christmas together this year, huh? Should be interesting.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, you -- you and Evangeline got any plans?",
        "Cristian: Well, I know that she wants to spend a couple of days with her parents either before or after Christmas. Aside from that, no, nothing. Actually, there's something that's been on my mind.",
        "Antonio: You -- you and Evangeline okay?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're doing great, we couldn't be better. It's just that -- well, every time I think about asking her to marry me, I realize that I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: You think Todd kidnapped Spencer?",
        "Bo: No question.",
        "Evangeline: Really?",
        "Bo: Yeah -- you don't?",
        "Evangeline: Well, Todd does stupid things, reckless things, no question, but he fought really hard to get his freedom back. I don't think he would risk it.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but there's one thing you can say about Manning -- no matter what he's into, he thinks he can get away with it.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, you are so right about that. Oh, my God, Bo. If Todd does have Spencer, I don't even want to think what he's doing to him.",
        "Bo: Well, with his sense of justice, you know he could end up back on Death Row.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Now, don't go second-guessing my doctors, okay? We got good news -- there's no tumor, so why don't we just relax and feel lucky for once in our lives?",
        "Todd: You don't feel lucky, Blair.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I do. I feel -- I feel lucky.",
        "Todd: You look like you feel guilty. I think that's what's making you so tense and giving you these headaches. It's not hard to figure out -- I just didn't see it till now.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah?",
        "Todd: Hmm. You did everything you could to bring Spencer down, but it wasn't enough and you blame yourself.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I -- I do. I mean, I let you down, I let the kids down, and I was a fool enough to buy into Spencer's bull and I'll never get over that, I don't think.",
        "Todd: Lies, Blair -- I think that's what's kept us apart. No more. We can't afford secrets and lies anymore. Am I right?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: So I have to confess something to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Too much Christmas cheer? Is that even possible?",
        "Nash: Obviously, it is. Look, Jessica, thank you for coming by.",
        "Jessica: Okay. I know that the Buchanan Christmas can be a little much, but you can't just ignore it.",
        "Nash: Why not, Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Because -- you'll get depressed, and I don't like seeing the people that I care about depressed on the holidays, okay? It's just easier to enjoy them.",
        "Nash: I'm not depressed. I just -- I got stuff on my mind, all right?",
        "Jessica: Nash?",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Jessica: You're having a Christmas. There is a tree tied to the roof of my car and I am not dragging it back inside Llanfair.",
        "Nash: A tree is a waste for one man. All right?",
        "Jessica: It's not just going to be one man. I -- I'm here and Bree's going to be here. Bree is looking forward to spending Christmas with her dad.",
        "Nash: You're not going to be here, and Bree is not going to miss a Christmas tree. She's an ankle biter.",
        "Jessica: Really? Well, maybe not now, but when she flips through those photo albums that you're putting together for her, she is going to be pretty disappointed that her dad didn't go all out for her first Christmas.",
        "Nash: Cheap shot.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. Now, are you going to help me go and get that tree or am I going to have to do it myself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: So you want to propose to Evangeline, but you can't?",
        "Cristian: That's what I said.",
        "Antonio: Well, why not?",
        "Cristian: How's it going to work?",
        "Antonio: What do you mean, \"how's it going to work?\" What, you need money, money for a ring?",
        "Cristian: Don't do that. Look, if I can't afford to buy Evangeline a ring, then I have no right to even think about asking her to marry me.",
        "Antonio: Oh, Cris, what are you talking about? Look, if Evangeline loves you -- which she does -- having a ring right now shouldn't even matter.",
        "Cristian: It's not about the ring, man. It's -- it's about what it represents. I want to be able to take care of her, give her the kind of life that she deserves, the kind of life that I'd -- that I'd want to give her.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Cristian: And want to be able to hold my head up in our relationship, you know, not have people looking at us like I'm some lazy freeloader living off his wife.",
        "Antonio: Oh, you know, first of all, no one's going to think that, and second of all, since when do you care what other people think? I mean, this -- this is about you and Evangeline making a commitment. Money shouldn't even enter into it.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, easy for you to say. Hey, come on, man. You and Jess had plenty of issues before you got your inheritance, and you didn't get married. And now, whatever Jessica needs or wants, you give her.",
        "Antonio: Oh, no, wait a second. The only thing Jessica needs is my love and my loyalty, and if I thought otherwise we wouldn't be together.",
        "Cristian: Coming out of the mouth of a rich man.",
        "Antonio: You know, maybe it's not the money. Maybe you're not ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Todd has to have more sense than that, right? He wouldn't do something so self-destructive.",
        "Bo: Look, Manning's never been a favorite of mine. I hate the way he takes the law into his own hands, but I can understand how the possibility of Truman never being punished -- I can see how that'd drive him crazy.",
        "Evangeline: Does John know about Spencer going M.I.A.?",
        "Bo: Not as far as I know. I want to be the first one to tell him.",
        "Evangeline: You know, he's going to flip out when he hears about this.",
        "Bo: I don't know who wants to see Truman get punished more -- Todd or John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Natalie: You know, if I knew it wouldn't set your recovery back for weeks, I would throw this at you except for, then, the doctor would know I gave you soda.",
        "John: Huh. Thank you.",
        "Natalie: You know that I love you with all of my heart and I would absolutely never do anything to hurt you. However --",
        "John: Oh, boy. Here it comes.",
        "Natalie: I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that you do nothing to compromise your recovery and I mean everything. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Of course. Huh. I understand. Yeah, thank you.",
        "Natalie: Michael?",
        "Michael: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: They said what you expected, right?",
        "Michael: Yeah, I knew what they were going to say. What John wants to do, it's -- it's insane.",
        "Natalie: I know and I am so worried. You know, when I told him about Spencer, he acted so calm. He actually said that he was going to let other people take care of Spencer and concentrate on what's important.",
        "Michael: Hmm.",
        "Natalie: And then the minute I turn my back -- I should just make them take the phone away from his room.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Nat, this is my brother we're talking about. He'd find another way.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, he would. He says he's changing, and with me -- with me, he is.",
        "Michael: Yeah, but that -- you have to understand. That was before, after he locked Spencer up. But now, all bets are off, because until the man that killed our father is brought to justice, he won't be able to put it behind him. And one thing he's definitely not going to do is listen to reason -- not from you, not from me, not from anybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Look, Cris, if it's money you need, I mean -- or anything -- bro, don't -- don't let pride get in the way of asking for help.",
        "Cristian: It's not like I can ask for help and know that I'd be able to pay it back.",
        "Antonio: Oh, what -- now you're never going to make a good living? How about having a little faith?",
        "Cristian: Faith in what, man? I have nothing that I can take to the bank right now, nothing.",
        "Antonio: I got an idea. How about you stop thinking about what you can't do and start focusing on what you can?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Supposing I let you put your Christmas tree in my house. I don't have any ornaments, I don't have ornaments, I'm not going to buy any ornaments, I'm not going to waste any money. What?",
        "Jessica: I have ornaments for you right here.",
        "Nash: You're too much. You know that? You're too much.",
        "Jessica: I love Christmas. I want my daughter to love Christmas and it would be really nice, Nash, if you loved Christmas, too.",
        "Nash: You can't shove Christmas cheer down somebody's throat. They either got it or they don't. I'm sorry -- I don't.",
        "Jessica: Wow. Have you always been this scroogey or is this just a new development?",
        "Nash: I love Christmas. I love it. I'm going to do Christmas. I'm going to -- I'm going to spoil her with gifts, I'm going to take pictures. I'm going to do the whole Santa Claus thing. I'm looking forward to it.",
        "Jessica: Let me help.",
        "Nash: That's just the thing -- you're not helping. Christmas trees are for families.",
        "Jessica: You have a family.",
        "Nash: It would be great for the five or six hours that Bree was here, but then it'd just be a tree in the corner.",
        "Jessica: You have a family, Nash.",
        "Nash: I'm barely a part-time father. It doesn't exactly count. I'm not depressed.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. Well, if you're not depressed, you're coming very close to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You got a beautiful woman who loves you. Why don't you concentrate on that?",
        "Cristian: You know damn well it's not that simple.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, because you're making it complicated!",
        "Cristian: Fine. So I should just ignore the fact that I have no money and no career?",
        "Antonio: Oh. All right, look, Cris. You've been through a terrible ordeal, all right? Most people only have nightmares about what you've actually lived, all right? And -- and you got your life back, all right? That in itself -- you should be so damn proud of it, man, not to mention that you almost won the cruiserweight championship. I mean, how many guys get that far? All right? And you -- and you would've actually won it if -- if Vincent hadn't rigged it. And if that's not enough, you're a kick-ass painter.",
        "Cristian: With a bum hand.",
        "Antonio: All right, look, so, uh -- maybe you can't paint, maybe you can't sculpt, all right? But you'll find a way to express yourself. All right? We're all -- look, what I'm trying to say is that -- that life is too short, okay? And if you love someone and someone loves you back, then you need to enjoy the hell out of it, and why am I having this conversation with you?",
        "Cristian: All right, you're right. I should know this, and I do.",
        "[Antonio sighs]",
        "Antonio: Good. Good, because I got to go. I've got to meet Jess at Nash's.",
        "Cristian: Jessica at Nash's? What's she doing over there?",
        "Antonio: Oh, she's bringing him some Christmas decorations. What?",
        "Cristian: Nothing. I -- I just don't know how you do it, man. I wouldn't be able to.",
        "Antonio: Nash is a good guy, Cris.",
        "Cristian: All right.",
        "Antonio: Okay? And he's connected because of Bree and he's a part -- he's going to be a part of this family and I'm not going to fight that, okay? And -- and, you know, the bottom line is, is that Bree and Jessica, they -- they love me, all right? And if I start to feel threatened by Nash, then that means I start to doubt Jessica and I'm not going to go there.",
        "Cristian: Hmm.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Evangeline: Sorry to interrupt you guys.",
        "Antonio: No, no. Actually, you're not interrupting anything. Remember what I said.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Oh. Thanks, huh?",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Evangeline: Bye.",
        "Antonio: Bye.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, Cris. Hmm. Oh, God, you have no idea how much I needed this.",
        "Cristian: Bad day, huh?",
        "Evangeline: Oh, it was the worst.",
        "Cristian: Don't worry. I know just how to make it better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Uncle Bo.",
        "Bo: Mike.",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "Bo: How's the patient doing?",
        "Natalie: Impatient, but he's doing better all the time.",
        "Bo: Oh, oh. Well, that's good to hear. I -- did you hear about Truman?",
        "Michael: Only that the judge declared him incompetent to stand trial, shipped him off to Wingdale.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, listen --",
        "Natalie: Well, is there something else?",
        "Bo: I -- I think John should hear this, too, okay, so why don't we just go on in?",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "John: Hey, boss.",
        "Bo: How you doing, John?",
        "John: I heard Truman tried to get himself a section eight. We're not going to let him get away with that, are we? What?",
        "Bo: Well, there's no easy way to tell you this, so I guess I should just tell you. The van that was taking Truman to the sanitarium was hijacked. Truman was taken from the scene by a masked assailant. Hmm.",
        "John: Well, as ridiculous as it sounds, he probably arranged it.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, that's what we thought, at first.",
        "John: But now?",
        "Bo: Now, it's starting to look like Manning is behind it.",
        "Natalie: Why would you think that?",
        "Bo: Because Manning hates Truman and because Manning always seems to want to take the law into his own hands. Plus, he was just way too calm when the judge called a mistrial. That's not the way you'd expect him to react.",
        "John: You put a tail on him?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Plus I have every available cop looking for Truman. The entire eastern seaboard's been alerted. Sorry that I have to give you this news.",
        "John: No, no. Thanks for coming down to tell me, you know. Go catch this guy for me, will you, Bo?",
        "Bo: We'll do that.",
        "John: Thanks. And for his sake, I hope you're wrong about Manning.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Oh, yeah, me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: No, you see, Todd, there is something you don't understand about me -- I don't lose. And I'm not going to lose this time. There is no way in hell --",
        "Woman's voice: Spencer?",
        "Spencer: Ma? Ma?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You want to confess something, Todd?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? You're -- you're scaring me --",
        "Todd: No, no, no.",
        "Blair: You're -- what is it?",
        "Todd: You told me once that you thought that if I had confided in you about Margaret and the baby and what happened at the lake, that maybe you wouldn't have run to Spencer. Right?",
        "Blair: Well, things might've -- might've been different, yeah.",
        "Todd: They might've been? Of course there's no way to tell now, but anyway, the point is -- I realize now lying to you was a mistake, even though I thought that lying to you at the time was the best thing for you, but it didn't end well. I almost lost everything as a result of it.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: Uh -- so now, because I feel this regret about lying to you and because I have vowed never to do it again, I feel like I have to tell you about something. I feel like I should tell you about something that I've been planning and am doing that I didn't fill you in on.",
        "Blair: Something that you've been planning?",
        "Todd: Yes. Now -- if you love me like you say you love me, then you're going to support me with this, and you're going to understand. And if you don't, I don't know what's going to happen because I feel like I'm risking everything by telling you, so --",
        "Blair: Todd? What did you do?",
        "Todd: I kidnapped Spencer and I'm keeping him prisoner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yeah, I wish I could stay.",
        "Michael: You can't stay, Bo. You got to get out there. You got to catch this guy.",
        "Bo: No, you're right, okay. You take care, John, okay?",
        "John: Thanks, Bo.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
