        "Helen: Well, I say chuck it. The man was a menace.",
        "Blair: You know, don't you wonder why that is? I mean, he had everything: Good looks, great job, all kinds of money, me. Then he had to go and do all those... terrible things. He could have had a really great life.",
        "Helen: If only he hadn't killed all those people.",
        "Blair: Well, all I can tell you is whatever he hid in this box, he put in a safe deposit box, and it could have the answers to all kinds of questions. Now, aren't you just a little bit curious about that?",
        "Helen: Nope.",

        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm. Didn't sound like it.",
        "Todd: Well, that's 'cause my P.I. won't call me back. I hired him to dig up some dirt on Eddie Ford, and I haven't heard anything.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you're just investigating the guy. You're not--I thought you put a hit out on him. Todd? Tell me you didn't do anything stupid.",

        "James: Well, that's my dad for you.",
        "Starr: Well, not to mention he said horrible things to me, Langston, and Dani, and I know that that bothered you. I mean, it bothered all of us, so I wouldn't blame you if you went over to your dad to teach him some manners.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Doctor: Does the name Nora mean anything to you?",
        "Gigi: She's a friend of ours, but I couldn't tell you why he said her name. Doctor, he's gonna make it, right? I mean, I know he's unconscious, but--",
        "Doctor: I can't tell you anything until I've finished examining him.",
        "Nurse: If you could wait outside.",

        "Charlie: What happened?",

        "Charlie: How bad is it?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. He hit his head.",

        "Aubrey: I know, what are the odds? Ha! Well, God has a sick sense of humor. How else do you explain me winding up seated next to the woman who is still in love with my fianc\u00e9? Oh, no. She told me. When I was telling her how I went after what I wanted and met someone. Great advice, huh? No, she had plenty of chances to tell him how she felt about him, and she never did, and then when she found out that Joey and I were together, she bent over backwards to smooth things over. Yeah. She told him that she got back together with his brother. I know. Crazy chick, right? But hey, works for me.",

        "Echo: Uh, I don't know what Charlie told you--",
        "Viki: You don't?",
        "Echo: Uh-uh.",
        "Viki: Why? Did you have a blackout? See, that's what comes from binge drinking.",
        "Echo: B--ha ha! Binge drinking? Ha ha!",
        "Viki: What would you call downing several pitchers of mimosas at brunch?",
        "Echo: Well, I had two drinks, 3 tops.",
        "Viki: Right, right. Anyway, we were talking about your memory lapse, so let me fill you in. It seems that when Charlie brought you home, you threw yourself at him, told him that you two belong together, and, um, um, well, other rubbish. Ring any bells?",
        "Echo: Well, yes. Charlie was kind enough to bring me here. That's true.",
        "Viki: Oh, you don't need to verify anything for me because I know exactly what happened. Memory kicking in a little? No? Well, then, here's some more. It seems that you asked Charlie to keep your little, um, well, let's call it a meltdown, shall we? A secret from me. No surprise there. Ha ha! Lying has always been your occupation.",
        "Echo: Oh, yes, well...",
        "Viki: Makes me wonder what else you're lying about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: What sort of short-sighted scheme have you cooked up now, huh?",
        "Todd: Since when am I short-sighted?",
        "T\u00e9a: You will be if you lie to me.",
        "Blair: Oh. Good. You are home. Here.",
        "T\u00e9a: What's this?",
        "Blair: A box.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, yeah, I can see that. What's the occasion?",
        "Todd: Christmas?",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair and I don't do Christmas.",
        "Todd: Oh, my God, it's your birthday.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, my God, it's not. Oh, my God, you don't know when my birthday is?",
        "Todd: Yes, of course I do, but this is Blair.",
        "Blair: Who happens to be standing right here.",
        "Todd: She doesn't always play by the rules.",
        "Blair: Look, it's no occasion, all right? I--I just don't want it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, so you're re-gifting?",
        "Blair: No. Well, yeah, kind of, yeah, I guess.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, what is it?",
        "Blair: I don't know.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't know what's in the box?",
        "Blair: Well, whatever, I don't want it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, what makes you think I want it?",
        "Blair: Oh, you want it. It's from Eli.",

        "Aubrey: Okay, Aubrey, what to wear for a visit with your future mother-in-law? Want to make a good first impression, but I don't want to look like I'm trying too hard. Hmm. What about this? Eh, close but no cigar. This is Viki Banks we're talking about. Although, from what Joey says, his family doesn't really have time for fashion. So, huh? I need something casual, low maintenance that says, \"I don't have time for trivialities. I'm too busy saving the whales and ending poverty as we know it.\" Definitely not. I would not be caught dead saving whales in this. Stop it, Aubrey. You're making too big of a deal of this. When you met Joey, you were not trying to impress anyone. He just fell in love with you as you are, as I'm sure his mother will. So... just be yourself.",

        "Joey: Danish? Juice? Coffee?",
        "Kelly: Uh, maybe just some tea. Thank you. I don't think my stomach could take it anyway.",
        "Joey: Are you sick?",
        "Kelly: Uh, no, no. I--I--you know, I have stress. I have stress, and so my stomach gets a little...",
        "Joey: What are you stressed about? What's going on, Kel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: I'm sorry that I asked Charlie to lie to you.",
        "Viki: Why? Oh, because you got caught.",
        "Echo: No, because it put Charlie in an awkward position, and it wasn't gracious. You've been very generous.",
        "Viki: Mmm. And it would be such a shame to see this free ride end, wouldn't it? To find yourself banished from the premises and far away from Rex and Shane and Charlie.",
        "Echo: Is that how you want it, Viki? Me banished?",
        "Viki: Ha ha! My husband wants to get to know his son, and I would like that for him, and he seems to think that he needs you to make that happen. So I am going to give you one more chance. You can thank me now.",
        "Echo: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Oh, you're so welcome. You know, if I actually thought that Charlie was in any way susceptible to your, well, charms, you'd be upstairs packing your bags right now.",
        "Echo: He felt very susceptible when we kissed.",
        "Viki: Excuse me.",

        "Charlie: He's alive. Just come and let Viki know.",

        "Blair: So I'm safe.",
