        "At Todd's trial, Tea convinces Todd that he did not rape Marty. And he changes his plea to not guilty and lets her be his lawyer. Everybody is outraged. A judge tells Vanessa that there is no way she has legal grounds to stay in the US and that she and Lola will have to be deported. But at that point, Cristian decides he will marry her so that she does not have to go back to Columbia. It seems that Jessica has turned into Tess after attending the group therapy, hearing Brody talking about taking a child from his mother, and realizing that she did something very similar. She agrees to sleep with Brody in exchange for his help in busting her out of St. Anne's. And the doctor catches them."

        "Todd: Not guilty, Your Honor. Not guilty.",
        "Nora: Your Honor, this is absurd. Please. There was a deal in place for the defendant contingent upon a guilty plea.",
        "Blair: I told you. I told you. T\u00e9a would walk in here and get Todd to change his plea.",
        "Starr: He knows what he did was wrong, doesn't he? He knows he's guilty.",
        "Todd: I am not guilty, Your Honor. I did not rape Marty Saybrooke, not this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Do you want to marry Vanessa so she can stay in the country? Just tell me.",
        "Cristian: I told you, no. I won't do that to you.",
        "Cristian: I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't marry you.",
        "Vanessa: It's all right, mija. It's all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] I need to be with my baby and Bree. I need to see my girls.",
        "Brody: They're okay. You said your family's taking care of them.",
        "Tess: They can't take care of them like I can.",
        "Brody: But they love them.",
        "Tess: They don't know anything about them.",
        "Brody: What do you mean?",
        "Tess: The Christmas lights. They don't know about the Christmas lights.",
        "Brody: What Christmas lights?",
        "Tess: Well, last year, Nash put these blinking Christmas lights on this tree outside of our window and Bree and I sat and watched them for hours.",
        "Brody: I'm sure your mom has Christmas lights.",
        "Tess: They're not the same. And Chloe? She doesn't even know me. It's my baby's first Christmas and I'm not going to be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Let's see, oh, look -- that's the sugarplum fairy. She's pretty, huh? You know what? Maybe one day we'll take a ride into Manhattan and you can see her for real.",
        "Jared: Hi. I know, you said we don't need any more presents.",
        "Natalie: I said that? Because I don't remember saying that.",
        "Jared: Right.",
        "Natalie: What's wrong with spoiling them?",
        "Jared: Well, because no matter what we get them, it's not going to make up for what they're missing this year.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You don't know what it's like not to be able to hold your baby.",
        "Brody: I've got a pretty good idea. You'll have lots of Christmases with her. You can show her the blinking lights.",
        "Tess: I don't even know where they are. Nash put them away somewhere. It's my first Christmas without him, too.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. Christmas when you've just lost somebody you love, it sucks.",
        "Tess: No one here understands how I feel. No one knows what it's like to lose everything, not being able to take care of your children, not even being able to see them.",
        "Brody: I understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Order. Mr. Manning, I've just read a laundry list of charges against you.",
        "T\u00e9a: My client pleads not guilty to every one.",
        "Nora: Uh, procedure, Your Honor?",
        "Judge: Just a minute, Ms. Hanen. Is your client aware that any deal he made prior to changing his plea is now null and void?",
        "T\u00e9a: He is.",
        "Judge: Well, I would like to hear him say that. Mr. Manning?",
        "Todd: Yes, I'm aware of it.",
        "Judge: Well, so be it. A plea of not guilty is hereby entered.",
        "Marty: Is he really changing his plea?",
        "Nora: It appears so.",
        "Marty: What happens now?",
        "Nora: Unfortunately, we go to trial.",
        "Marty: I have to testify?",
        "Nora: I'm very sorry.",
        "Marty: What about Todd?",
        "Nora: Him? I rip him limb from limb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Vanessa, I'll do anything to help you and Lola, but I can't marry you. I'm sorry.",
        "Lola: You're not sorry. You just want whatever Sarah wants.",
        "Vanessa: Basta. Cristian has already done so much for us.",
        "Lola: What's going to happen when we go back to Colombia?",
        "Langston: Lola, it's going to be okay.",
        "Lola: Did you think that when you were supposed to go to Colombia with my father?",
        "Sarah: Lola, he's not going to hurt you. He's in prison.",
        "Lola: You don't know that.",
        "Sarah: Look at how hard it was for Cristian to get out. He's not going to get out.",
        "Lola: What are you talking about? Vanessa bought him out of there. Someone can do that for my father.",
        "Vanessa: Sarah's right. Ray is in prison now. We are going to have plenty of time to figure out a way to protect ourselves. You can't always rely on other people, no matter how wonderful they are.",
        "Lola: So we're just going to leave?",
        "Vanessa: Look, we don't have another choice, Lola.",
        "Cristian: T\u00e9a will think of something.",
        "Vanessa: Look, I know you believe in your friend, but she can't work miracles.",
        "Cristian: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You did the right thing, Todd.",
        "Todd: Nora looks pretty pissed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait till you see her face when you get bail. I'll have you out of here before you know it.",
        "Judge: We will proceed now with the question of bail. Now, may I remind counsel that in order to be released from custody the defendant must demonstrate that he will appear in court at the appointed time, that he will not flee the jurisdiction, and that he poses no threat to the community.",
        "Blair: Yeah, that's right, that's Todd in a nutshell.",
        "Judge: Need I remind those seated in the gallery to please refrain from comments? Good. Ms. Hanen?",
        "Nora: Yes, Your Honor. Before I make my request regarding bail for the defendant, I'd like to offer some -- well, these supportive documents, please. Given the breadth and scope of this information, the people request remand, Your Honor.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Nora: Yes, the people request that Todd Manning be held without bail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Todd's arraignment is today.",
        "Jared: Is your mom going?",
        "Natalie: I don't think that she wants to have anything to do with him right now.",
        "Jared: Right, I guess I get that.",
        "Natalie: Is this for the kids?",
        "Jared: Maybe.",
        "Natalie: You know, because if you got me a tutu I am so going to kill you.",
        "Jared: Oh, well, then I can take it back.",
        "Natalie: What'd you get me?",
        "Jared: I'm not going to tell you.",
        "Natalie: This bag, isn't it?",
        "Jared: No. It's not.",
        "Natalie: It so is.",
        "Jared: See? It's exactly what you wanted, right? Socks.",
        "Natalie: Fine. Then I'm not going to tell you what I got you, either.",
        "Jared: I know which one it is.",
        "Natalie: You do not.",
        "Jared: It's that one.",
        "Natalie: No. Actually, that's for Jessica. And I better get it in the mail really soon, because obviously I'm not going to be able to deliver it in person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You know how it feels. You had to say good-bye to Shane twice.",
        "Brody: He deserves to be with his real parents.",
        "Tess: That doesn't mean that you love him any less.",
        "Brody: The Christmas card helped. Seeing me and him, smiling together.",
        "Tess: Sounded like it made it worse.",
        "Brody: Shane can never make anything worse. But talking about what happened, it made me think about me and him. It made me miss him.",
        "Tess: But at least you know that he's with his parents, right? I mean, my little girls, they must think that their mommy doesn't give a damn.",
        "Brody: What if somebody brought them for a visit?",
        "Tess: I'm not allowed.",
        "Brody: Yeah, me neither.",
        "Tess: You know, before this happened I had never spent one night away from Bree. And Chloe -- I miss them both so much. It's like this aching inside of me, this hole, and it hurts so bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: So that one is for Jessica. And this one is for me.",
        "Natalie: No. Actually, it's for the kids. And I think I'm going to give it to them right now.",
        "Jared: What about Santa?",
        "Natalie: Hello? That's nine days away.",
        "Jared: Excuse me, eight days, ten hours, twelve minutes, and 35 seconds. 34, 33 ...",
        "Natalie: Whatever. I think they can use it. Look, girls. This is for you.",
        "Bree: Mommy!",
        "[Natalie laughs]",
        "Jared: That's a good call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Tess sighs dramatically]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] I'm okay, thank you.",
        "Brody: You sure?",
        "Tess: I'm fine. I just need to look at them.",
        "Brody: They are beautiful.",
        "Tess: It's all I have left of them. And they don't have anything of me. They'll probably forget all about me.",
        "Brody: They won't. You'll see them again. You have a whole lifetime with them.",
        "Tess: No, I need to be with them now.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.",
        "Tess: It's okay, you're fine. Thank you.",
        "Brody: I just wish there was some way I could help you.",
        "Tess: You know -- maybe there is.",
        "Brody: Whatever you need, I'll do it.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Really? No, no. I can't, it's too crazy.",
        "Brody: Uh, I thought that's why we're here.",
        "Nun: You two wouldn't want to miss the movie.",
        "Brody: What movie?",
        "Nun: The third Tuesday of every month in the common room. At the end of the hall with the Christmas lights.",
        "Tess: It's a sign.",
        "Brody: You want to go watch the movie?",
        "Brody: Yeah?",
        "Tess: We can't talk about it here. Come with me to my room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Do you think that Bree really likes the album?",
        "Jared: Even more than the nutcracker.",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I guess I go a little crazy when it comes to Christmas, anyway.",
        "Brody: With two little girls and one little boy? Not possible.",
        "[Natalie laughs]",
        "Natalie: Sometimes I think I'm just making up for when I was a kid.",
        "Jared: Was Roxy not into making eggnog and trimming the tree?",
        "Natalie: Not so much. I mean, it wasn't totally bad, because there was this kid Justin who lived a couple of houses away. And his family, they had a train that went around their Christmas tree.",
        "Jared: So did my cousin. I was always so jealous.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I used to lay underneath there for hours just waiting for that train to come by again and see the sparkling light. It used to make me feel like everything was going to be okay.",
        "Jared: There is a hobby shop down the street.",
        "Natalie: I thought you were getting me socks. Well, unless you want a couple right in the kisser.",
        "Jared: Yeah, no, no. I don't want you to get me anything. I told you that. I have everything I want. You know, when I didn't know where you were, it was like losing everything. And if Tess wanted me to know what it felt like to lose Nash, well, it worked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Okay, what is it? And why can't you tell me in public?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You were a Navy Seal, weren't you? I mean, that's what you said in group.",
        "Brody: Yeah. What does that have to do with helping you?",
        "Tess: Well, you've been on secret missions. You know how to get people into and out of places.",
        "Brody: I'm a patient here, too.",
        "Tess: So?",
        "Brody: We can't just run away.",
        "Tess: I need to see my kids.",
        "Brody: I know.",
        "Tess: I need to see them now, okay? I need to make sure that they're okay. So please, help me. Help me get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Call me when you get this, T\u00e9a. Thanks. I'm sorry; I don't know where she is.",
        "Vanessa: We better get going to the courthouse. Are your bags packed, Lola?",
        "Lola: They're right here.",
        "Vanessa: Good. Now say good-bye to Cristian -- and thank him.",
        "Langston: We'd better go, too.",
        "Markko: I got it.",
        "Langston: Thanks.",
        "Vanessa: Um, I'm really sorry. She's usually not so rude.",
        "Cristian: It's okay. It's understandable.",
        "Vanessa: Yeah. Well, I guess I better get going as well, so --",
        "Sarah: Good luck, Vanessa. I hope things work out for you.",
        "Vanessa: Thank you. Um, would you mind? I would just like a moment with Cristian.",
        "Sarah: Um -- yeah, sure. I was going to grab a paper, so I'll be back in a minute,",
        "Vanessa: I don't know why I asked her to leave. I really don't know what to say.",
        "Cristian: You don't have to say anything.",
        "Vanessa: But I have to find a special way to say thank you to someone who's meant so much to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, the defense is ready to make its request for bail. Unfortunately, I haven't viewed D.A. Hanen's greatest hits.",
        "Judge: Don't try my patience, Ms. Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm simply trying to explain that whatever documents the D.A. has dredged up are irrelevant and dated. My client is no threat to society.",
        "Nora: This is not ancient history, Your Honor. There is a restraining order currently in place against Mr. Manning.",
        "T\u00e9a: That hardly proves he is a threat to society.",
        "Nora: Just to his children.",
        "T\u00e9a: Proving he has a reason to stay in the area and is not a flight risk.",
        "Nora: He was planning on leaving the state with the woman he was holding hostage.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry, was that proven?",
        "Nora: I found him myself trying to escape from the hospital.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh, where a gunshot was heard.",
        "Nora: A single gunshot. The incident was contained and no patients were evacuated.",
        "T\u00e9a: The victim of the gunshot was, I believe, Mr. Manning's daughter's doctor. Maybe he was trying to help?",
        "Nora: Oh, please.",
        "Judge: Order. I won't remind you again. Now, counsel, approach.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Listen to her, talking about Todd as if he's some great father, as if she knows.",
        "Marty: It's her job, isn't it?",
        "Blair: He paid her $5 million to take Starr away from me before.",
        "Marty: I'm just saying, she seems like a good lawyer.",
        "Blair: Yeah, she is. I think that's the problem.",
        "Marty: I don't know what I'll do if Todd gets off.",
        "Cole: Mom, don't worry. Todd's not going to get off. Everyone knows he's guilty.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but --",
        "Cole: Yeah, but what? What?",
        "Starr: He's pleading not guilty.",
        "Cole: He's lying, like he always does.",
        "Starr: Okay, I know that. I know the truth. It's just --",
        "Cole: It's just, it's just. He's your dad.",
        "Starr: Okay, not just him, but T\u00e9a, too. I loved them, okay? And now they're the enemy.",
        "Marty: Do you really think it's possible for him to walk away from this?",
        "John: There's a lot of evidence against him.",
        "Marty: What if it doesn't matter?",
        "John: If there's justice it will.",
        "Marty: But what if it doesn't?",
        "John: He's guilty. You have to believe the law's on your side.",
        "Marty: Was it on your side when you were trying to get me out of his house?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: The people have stated that my client is a flight risk. That is patently untrue.",
        "Nora: He owns his own private plane.",
        "T\u00e9a: And how is he going to fuel it? His assets are frozen, Your Honor. Even if he wanted to leave town, he doesn't have the funds to do it.",
        "Nora: He probably has fuel already in it. And I'm sure he has plenty of ways of making money.",
        "T\u00e9a: It doesn't already have fuel in it; I know that for a fact. And why would he even try to make money? He's easily recognizable.",
        "Nora: He faked his multi-personality disorder in order to avoid prison. I'm sure he has got lots of ways.",
        "Judge: I am aware of Mr. Manning's history.",
        "T\u00e9a: That has no bearing in this courtroom, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: Where did you do to law school, Ms. Delgado? A defendant's background has all the bearing in the world on a bail hearing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it obviously does in this courtroom, because you've already convicted Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: I really thought T\u00e9a would help us, but now it's over.",
        "Langston: Well, look how it turned out for me.",
        "Markko: Yeah, maybe something will work out, just at the last minute.",
        "Lola: I don't think it will work out for me that way.",
        "Langston: Well, then we'll come visit you anyway. I really want to see the Gold museum.",
        "Lola: How did you know about that?",
        "Langston: When we thought I was going to Colombia, Markko bought me a book about it.",
        "Lola: You did?",
        "Markko: Yeah, and the Cartagena de Indias. I read about it in the guide book.",
        "Lola: You would really come visit me?",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? We're family.",
        "Markko: And friends.",
        "Lola: Thanks.",
        "Langston: And I won't let you forget about us. And since I don't have a book about Llanview -- here.",
        "Langston: I'll send it to you.",
        "Lola: Thanks.",
        "Langston: I never thought I'd have a cousin. I hate this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: I -- I wrote you a note to thank you for everything that you've done, but it's not enough. It's so much more than that. I'll never forget you.",
        "Cristian: I'll never forget you, either.",
        "Vanessa: Your kindness is rare in this world, especially in mine. To meet someone like you, I didn't think it was possible. And when I kissed you -- and I know I had no right -- I'm going to hold that in my heart forever.",
        "Sarah: I was just looking at the time. I didn't want you to be late for your hearing.",
        "Vanessa: Thank you. I should go get Lola.",
        "Cristian: Sarah and I can go with you.",
        "Vanessa: No, we've already said our good-bye. Nunca te olvidare.",
        "Sarah: I just didn't want her to be late for her hearing. You know, I mean you get some crazy judge who just throws the whole case out.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Sarah: Hey, I'm sure they're going to be all right.",
        "Sarah: You know, for a minute there I thought you were actually going to say you would marry Vanessa.",

        "Natalie: All right, Bree. Are you almost ready? Almost time to go see Santa.",
        "Jared: Are you going to sit on Santa's lap, too?",
        "Natalie: I don't need to. I already have everything I want.",
        "Jared: You sure? Because I could take the socks back.",
        "Natalie: I'm going to take Bree to the lady's room. Come on, little lady.",
        "Jared: Okay, well, I'll watch the baby.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Jared: Chloe, what's going on? Did you get all your Christmas shopping done? Good, because I need your opinion about something -- Natalie's gift.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Tess asked me that before and I said no.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] No, Brody, come on. It's me, it's Jessica. I'm going to come right back. Just take me to my home and let me be with my girls at Christmas time.",
        "Brody: That's all you want to do?",
        "Tess: No one will even know that we were gone.",
        "Brody: I don't know.",
        "Tess: I'll look at them through the window, okay? Please, I hate being here.",
        "Brody: It's the only way we're going to get better.",
        "Tess: I thought so, too. But being away from my girls, it's killing me.",
        "Brody: Maybe I should talk to Dr. Levin.",
        "Tess: He won't do anything.",
        "Brody: He'll listen.",
        "Tess: He'll make me wait. My girls, they're my only reason for living, okay? And without them, I don't care what happens to me. You know, it's like how you were in Iraq, okay? Please. Please help me.",
        "Brody: All right, I will.",
        "Tess [As Jessica]: Thank you. Thanks so much.",
