        "Viki tells Natalie that Mitch survived. She senses that Natalie is upset about more than just that news. Natalie is about to tell her about it when Charlie comes home unexpectedly. Viki asks Charlie if the bottle she found in the year belongs to him. Charlie lies and says he has not been drinking. Jessica overhears. When Viki leaves, Jessica tells Charlie that she had only agreed to keep his secret because he swore it only happened once. He tells her that the bottle her mother found was from that one time. Jessica confides in Brody that Charlie has been drinking. She also tells him that she doesn't think Mitch tried to kill himself and asks Brody if he thinks Natalie tried to kill Mitch. He admits that John's behavior with the evidence collection was suspicious. Brody says he doesn't know what he is going to do about it, but he doesn't want John and Natalie to get hurt. John goes to the hospital to put the unconscious Mitch Laurence's fingerprints on a letter opener to create evidence to corroborate his story that Mitch attempted suicide. Mitch wakes up and asks John if he put Natalie away for stabbing him. John tells Mitch that he tried to kill himself. When Brody arrives, Mitch tells him that John McBain stabbed him.",

        "Delphina: I see a dark place from which there is no escape.",
        "Dorian: I'm not afraid of prison.",

        "Delphina: Okay. How's this for specific? It's someone in this room.",

        "Amelia: Forget the chicken soup. Just call me whenever you need me.",
        "Nick: What I need is --",

        "Amelia: I got to go.",
        "Langston: Wait. Is this because of Nick Chavez? Because if those hatemongers who attacked him come after my family, I --",
        "Dorian: They would have to do it over my dead body.",
        "Delphina: Well, you are right about that.",
        "Dorian: Of course. Because my reputation precedes me.",
        "Delphina: No. Because you're the one who's going to die.",

        "Dorian: And that is why I intend to continue the fight and fulfill my campaign promise.",
        "Starr: Even if it costs you your life?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. I am going to fight for the rights of same-gender couples to marry starting with my own. Oh, and here she is, my partner.",

        "Jessica: It's what happened at the police station yesterday.",
        "Brody: Jessica, I can't --",
        "Jessica: You didn't. Look, I knew it was weird that Mitch tried to commit suicide, and I know you didn't buy it either. So you think someone tried to kill Mitch, right? Who?",

        "Amelia: What prediction?",
        "Starr: She told Aunt Dorian that she was going to die if she didn't tear up the marriage license.",

        "Jessica: What about the letter opener?",
        "Brody: He wouldn't let me bag it as evidence. And then he didn't want me to take Natalie's statement. I tried to talk to her after --",

        "Brody: I've got information that could implicate John, not to mention your sister.",
