        "Cole: Hey, you know what you are? Pathetic.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi, Starr. I don't believe I've had the pleasure. I --",
        "Cole: You think you're some hotshot lawyer, showing up here, pushing everyone around, telling us how things are going to be. Like letting a monster like Todd Manning out of prison is the right thing to do?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd Manning is entitled to due process under the law.",
        "Cole: Let me tell you something. You're nothing but Manning's toy, just like my mom was. But my mom had an excuse. Todd was out to destroy her, and he'll do the same to you or worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Well, it's clearly a situation between Colombian nationals. Their government is going to have to deal with it.",
        "Cristian: But they'll never be safe there. Can't we apply for some sort of asylum to protect them?",
        "Judge: Their situation does not fit the criteria for asylum in the United States.",
        "Cristian: But if a death threat doesn't do it, then what's going to do it?",
        "Judge: You have to establish a well-founded fear --",
        "Cristian: Your Honor, they're lying --",
        "Judge: Of prosecution based on political opinion, race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social organization. The facts of Ms. Montez's case do not fit these criteria. This court has no choice but to uphold the original I.C.E. ruling. Vanessa and Lola Montez will be deported.",
        "Lola: No!",
        "Cristian: You can't do that, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: Do not test the patience of this court.",
        "Cristian: Vanessa Montez is going to be my wife.",
        "Judge: Excuse me?",
        "Cristian: Vanessa and I are in love and we're getting married. Please, don't take my fianc\u00e9e away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, now, listen. Just because he's big, from the North Pole, and rolls nine reindeers deep, does not mean you have to be scared of him. We will be right here with you every step of the way.",
        "Shane: Ha-ha, very funny.",
        "Gigi: You do realize he got wise to Santa a while ago.",
        "Rex: Not this Santa.",
        "Shane: Look, I'm not a kid. Santa doesn't exist. They're all fakes.",
        "Bo: Sure you want to take that chance, kid?",
        "Rex: I believe in you, man. What are you going to bring me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Okay, so don't try this at home because snooping through presents -- it's wrong. And Santa Claus, you know, he really doesn't like it. So when he's making his list, checking it twice, finding out who's -- ow!",
        "Jared: Ha, I caught you, see? You know what happens to naughty little girls when they go digging in places they're not supposed to?",
        "Natalie: They get spanked?",
        "Jared: Yeah, they get coal in their stockings.",
        "[Natalie giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Jessica!",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Brody: I called him.",
        "Tess: What? I -- I thought --",
        "Brody: You thought wrong.",
        "Tess: Well, why?",
        "Brody: Because I know who you are, and I know what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Do you have to go?",
        "Langston: No, I'm just wondering what Lola's doing right about now.",
        "Markko: Freaking out. I just hope this isn't a done deal. Maybe something could happen at the hearing today that will let Lola and Vanessa stay in the country.",
        "Langston: Like what, another gunshot?",
        "Markko: Like the judge having a heart.",
        "Langston: Well, the one I got sure didn't. I mean, the guy put my custody in the hands of a man I barely even knew.",
        "Markko: But you're still here in Llanview and not in Colombia with Ray.",
        "Langston: Yeah, because Vanessa shot him trying to protect Lola.",
        "Markko: We just lit candles in church. How about putting some positive vibes out into the universe?",
        "Langston: I'm trying, but it's just so close to home, you know? I mean, it feels like just yesterday I was saying my good-byes to you and Starr and everybody else. I know what it feels like to be told that you're getting on a plane and being shipped off to another country just because some judge says so.",
        "Markko: I know.",
        "Langston: And what do you do when you get there? I mean, they're going to have to go straight into hiding to protect Lola from Ray. You heard Lola today. She doesn't have any friends. She couldn't even stay in the same school for longer than a few months. They could end up homeless for all we know.",
        "Markko: Or worse if your Uncle Ray gets his hands on them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: You two are engaged to be married?",
        "Cristian: I know it's a surprise, but we were keeping it quiet.",
        "Judge: Oh, were you? Well, judging from the look on the face of your stepdaughter, you did a great job.",
        "Cristian: Your Honor, I know how this looks.",
        "Judge: Oh, do you? Because from where I'm sitting, it looks an awful lot like fraud.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: T\u00e9a, Cole has been through so much.",
        "T\u00e9a: Never apologize for anyone else, Starr. And even then, think twice about it.",
        "Cole: You see nothing wrong with what you're doing?",
        "T\u00e9a: I wish we'd met under different circumstances and I wish I had time to answer all your questions, but I really do have to go.",
        "Cole: Hey, you know what? Todd Manning raped my mom, okay? And after she lost her memory, he lied to her about who he was so he could rape her all over again.",
        "T\u00e9a: What happened between Todd and your mother --",
        "Cole: Was rape.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is complicated. Todd made mistakes, yes. But haven't you ever done anything that has given your loved ones pause?",
        "Cole: Are you comparing me to Todd?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm just saying no one's perfect. And I'm willing to bet that whatever happened isn't the result of a black and white situation. Neither is this one.",
        "[Cole scoffs]",
        "Cole: Oh, way to twist things. You are what everyone loves about lawyers.",
        "T\u00e9a: I really do have to go. I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So could you hook me up with one of those eyeglasses with the special hidden camera built in? Oh, and I'm also going to need a globe tracker extreme with GPS. It would really help boost the surveillance side of my P.I. business. Oh, and I'm going to need all the bells and whistles, too. Aren't you going to say \"Ho ho ho\"?",
        "[Santa grunts]",
        "Bo: All I want is for the police athletic league to find somebody else to do this next year. That and maybe a bottle of ibuprofen.",
        "Marcie: I might have some in my purse if you want it.",
        "Bo: That's all right, Marcie, really, I'm okay. You enjoying yourselves?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, Rex and Marcie are helping me show Shane his first Yankee Christmas.",
        "Bo: Well, all right. How's that going?",
        "Shane: Uh, it's good, I guess, but I wish they'd stop taking me to all this baby stuff.",
        "Gigi: You'll always be my baby, baby.",
        "Shane: Mom!",
        "Gigi: So I hear you're on tap to light the Christmas tree later. Are you going to lead us in caroling, too?",
        "[Bo laughs]",
        "Bo: No, see, Gigi, the goal is to treat the senses, not punish them. You know what? I'm due for a break. What do you say I treat everybody to a cup of hot chocolate?",
        "Rex: Oh, big spender. Who's in?",
        "Gigi: I'll have one.",
        "Marcie: Actually, I'll have apple cider if they have it.",
        "Bo: You got it.",
        "Rex: It'll be all right?",
        "Bo: Yeah, it's cool.",
        "Gigi: Marcie, I'm really glad you came out tonight.",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah, me, too. Michael's on duty and, you know, I really didn't want to be alone in that apartment all by myself.",
        "Gigi: You can always call me, anytime. You don't have to go through Christmas by yourself.",
        "Marcie: No, I know that. It's just that I --",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Marcie: Well, you were there for me almost a year ago when I lost Sam, and now I'm supposed to lean on you again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I will take this one, thank you very much.",
        "Natalie: My present's in there, isn't it?",
        "Jared: Did you get all your Christmas shopping done? Good, because I need your opinion about something -- Natalie's gift. What do you think? You just couldn't wait, could you? You had to snoop.",
        "Natalie: It so is. That's why you set the trap.",
        "Jared: It was a deterrent. Now maybe you'll think twice before ruining the surprise.",
        "Natalie: You know what? I had a really, really good reason for going through these bags.",
        "Jared: Oh, well, I'd love to hear this one.",
        "Natalie: Well, it's our first Christmas together, you know, and I had to find out how much you were doing it up. You know, I mean, I didn't want to overdo it or underdo it.",
        "Jared: I'll give you a clue -- I went all out.",
        "Natalie: You did?",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Like, how \"all out\"?",
        "Jared: Oh, you're not getting any more out of me. Any more questions shall be directed at Santa.",
        "Natalie: Oh, yikes! Bree, are you ready to go see Santa Claus? Because we have to get there before he closes up shop. Uncle Bo would be so mad if he didn't get to see his little girls. I'm going to take lots and lots of pictures.",
        "Jared: For Jess.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, well, I figure if she can't spend the holidays with her kids, we'll bring her kids to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] This was a trick?",
        "Doctor: No, what it was, was a flagrant violation of St. Ann's rules. You are both well aware of our policy regarding sexual activity between patients.",
        "Brody: We didn't have sex.",
        "Tess: No, we didn't have sex because you walked in. Brody didn't push the call button, I did.",
        "Brody: What? Now, hold on a second.",
        "Tess: It's true. He tried to force himself on me.",
        "Doctor: Send two orderlies to this room, stat.",
        "Brody: If I tried to force myself on her, then why was she the one that got all bent out of shape when you came in?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Well, that's because I -- I wasn't expecting you. You know, I thought they'd send in two orderlies, but thank God you came when you did. I was so scared.",
        "Brody: Oh, come off it. Where are the signs of a struggle?",
        "Tess: You're a Navy Seal, for God's sake. If I had struggled, then you would have tried to kill me -- like how he tried to kill Rex. Brody, I trusted you. I confided in you my fears about Tess and my kids, and I comforted you when you talked about Iraq, but none of that was an invitation to sex.",
        "Brody: I didn't want to have sex with you. I just wanted to prove you're Tess.",
        "Tess: Dr. Levin, Brody is way worse off than we thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I'll go bring these to Mom and Marcie.",
        "Rex: Thanks, I appreciate it.",
        "Shane: No problem.",
        "Rex: Does Matthew get like that around this time of year, too?",
        "Bo: What, extra nice, very helpful?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Actually, Matthew is like that generally all the time, but around the holidays, room's a little cleaner, you know, gets the homework done a little quicker.",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "Bo: How are you and Shane doing?",
        "Rex: Good, I guess.",
        "Bo: I think there's a \"but\" in there somewhere.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: I'm short of cash this Christmas. Any chance you could throw some work my way?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Thanks for the cider, Shane.",
        "Shane: Bo's the one who bought it. I just brought it over here.",
        "Gigi: Well, thank you for that. Shane, do you mind checking with Noelle to see if she is free to join us for the Christmas tree lighting?",
        "Shane: Is she at the Bon Jour?",
        "Gigi: The Buenos Dias.",
        "Shane: It's the same exact place.",
        "Gigi: In a different state.",
        "Shane: If it looks like a duck and smells like a duck, guess what? It's a duck, Mom.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Gigi: Oh, my, he is going to be a teenager before I know it.",
        "Marcie: He's a great kid.",
        "Gigi: I know.",
        "Marcie: You know, you guys are really lucky to have each other. You are.",
        "Gigi: Listen, Marcie, what you're dealing with -- you can lean on me as hard as you want because I'm tough and so are you.",
        "Marcie: Yeah? I don't feel very tough, you know. I mean, I look at all those presents under that tree and all I really want for Christmas is to hold my baby in my arms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Do you want to get out of here?",
        "Cole: More than anything.",
        "Starr: Look, I would apologize for T\u00e9a, but she kind of had a point about not apologizing for people, so --",
        "Cole: Are you really sticking up for her?",
        "Starr: No, no, Cole, I'm not. I just know her in a completely different way. When she was married to my dad, she was special to me. I promise you that she's not just a barracuda.",
        "Cole: I really don't want to hear about her soft side, okay? Anyone who would defend your dad after he held my mom hostage and everything else he did is less than human.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: I find it curious that the two of you waited until now to announce your intentions.",
        "Cristian: Well, we knew it would sound --",
        "Judge: Convenient.",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Judge: So you decided to withhold information vital to your status.",
        "Cristian: Your Honor, I can assure you we --",
        "Judge: Here's what I can assure you. You live in a post-9/11 world. Immigration fraud is considered an extremely serious crime in the United States.",
        "Vanessa: Your Honor --",
        "Cristian: We understand that,",
        "Judge: Oh, do you? Do you also understand that if you persist in this marriage gambit, you will be investigated by the Department of Homeland Security. And when they find out -- and they will find out that this is a marriage of convenience -- not only will Ms. Montez be deported, her name will be placed on a list of persons who will never be allowed inside this country again. And you, Mr. --",
        "Cristian: Vega.",
        "Judge: Vega -- will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, so think carefully before you answer my next question. Will this marriage be a real one?",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course it will be.",
        "Judge: And you are?",
        "T\u00e9a: T\u00e9a Delgado, counsel for Ms. Montez and her stepdaughter. I apologize for being late, Your Honor. I was detained in another courtroom on a separate matter.",
        "Cristian: T\u00e9a, we just gave the judge the good news.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, did he congratulate you? I know this is sudden, and you're right if you think that my clients are getting married as a means of obtaining a stay of deportation, but this is by no means a marriage of convenience. Vanessa Montez and Cristian Vega are deeply in love with each other. They plan to build a life together, and they're going to do it right here in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You guys look whipped.",
        "Markko: What happened in court today? Oh, no.",
        "Starr: My dad was going to plead guilty, but then his lawyer --",
        "Cole: Starr's former stepmom.",
        "Starr: His lawyer convinced him not to.",
        "Markko: What?",
        "Langston: So then what did he plead, not guilty?",
        "Starr: Yep.",
        "Langston: But that's insane. There's so much evidence against your dad.",
        "Markko: Since when has that stopped a rich guy from beating the rap?",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry, Cole.",
        "Starr: Now his lawyer pushed for this hearing that happens tomorrow to decide whether there will be a big trial or not.",
        "Langston: Seriously? And this woman used to be your stepmother?",
        "Starr: So how did your cousin's case go?",
        "Langston: I don't know. We're still waiting to find out.",
        "Cole: You sound worried.",
        "Langston: Can you blame me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Well, you and your clients are welcome to roll the dice if that's what you want, but I have already informed them that if they persist in this marriage status application, they will automatically trigger a Homeland Security investigation.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, I can assure you my clients are very much in love. Vanessa Montez rescued Cristian Vega from a lifetime of false imprisonment in Colombia. They spent an extended period of time together before coming back to the U.S., and they have been inseparable ever since. Somewhere along the way, they fell in love. Your Honor, my clients can't be faulted for having kept their plans under wraps given Vanessa's ambiguous legal status.",
        "Judge: Don't tell me what I may or may not fault them for.",
        "T\u00e9a: To prematurely announce their engagement might have taken an enormous emotional toll on Ms. Montez's stepdaughter. I understand your skepticism, Your Honor. But if I understand correctly, the Department of Homeland Security guidelines specify that a disclosure of this nature merits a full B.I.A. review. I am confident that my clients will be able to answer any and all questions regarding the nature of their relationship.",
        "Judge: Do you two love each other?",
        "Cristian: Yes, Your Honor.",
        "Vanessa: Si, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: Well, you better be ready to prove it. You've got 24 hours. Be here tomorrow for a full B.I.A. review, after which, I will render my final decision. This court is adjourned.",
        "Lola: Oh, my God. Thank you so much.",
        "Vanessa: Gracias.",
        "Cristian: We really appreciate this, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't thank me yet. We still have to pull this off.",

        "Bo: All right, Balsom, what's going on?",
        "Rex: Well, Shane has his heart set on a Z-box this year.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, but they just dropped the prices on those things -- at least that's the news that Matthew's been using to hustle me. So you and Gigi can skip a couple of date nights. You ought to be able to swing it.",
        "Rex: Well, there are no date nights for Gigi and me right now. Between going to Texas and getting shot, my credit cards are maxed out. U.V.'s not doing so hot. I haven't been able to take any cases. I'm tap city, Bo, and I've already promised Gigi and Shane both that a Z-box is in the works.",

        "Tess: [As Jessica] He is out of control. He is worse off than when he got here.",
        "Brody: You can say whatever you want. It doesn't change that Jessica's disappeared and Tess has taken her place.",
        "Tess: What? He would say anything not to get tossed out of here.",
        "Brody: There's got to be some kind of test you can run to prove which personality she is.",
        "Tess: Okay, he forced himself on me. Why are we standing here talking about it?",
        "Dr. Levin: Jessica, please --",
        "Tess: No, I want to call the police. I want to press charges. And my uncle is the police commissioner, by the way. So get the police on the phone, now!",
        "Brody: She came to me. She said she had to see her kids and she begged me to break her out of here.",
        "Dr. Levin: So you responded by initiating sexual contact?",
        "Brody: I had to know who I was dealing with. No, listen -- look, the last time she begged me to break her out of here, she came on to me. But it wasn't Jessica, it was Tess. You know, and then when I told Jessica what Tess did, she was mortified because that's not who Jess is. Jessica would never use her body to get what she wants, but, Tess, she didn't even blink.",
        "Tess: You don't believe that bull, do you?",
        "Dr. Levin: Mr. Lovett will have to be removed. And you, Tess, need to take a nap.",

        "Rex: I don't want your money.",
        "Bo: Just take it.",
        "Rex: I don't need it.",
        "Bo: You just told me that you're short of cash, you're looking for work.",
        "Rex: Right -- work, not a handout.",
        "Bo: Call it a loan.",
        "Rex: You know, there were times when I would have made up this story just to get some money. Those times are over.",
        "Bo: All right, all right, Balsom. Look, I'll keep an eye out for something for you, okay? But don't let your pride get in the way of a little help.",
        "Rex: Can't do it, Bo.",
        "Bo: Balsom --",
        "Rex: Bo, what kind of father would I be if I let another man pay for my kid's Christmas present? Now, your offer means a lot, it really does, but it's not a big deal. I can handle it.",

        "Markko: So you guys want to hit the mall? I still have some Christmas shopping to do.",
        "[Markko sighs]",

        "Langston: Same. But if I stay here any longer, I feel like my butt's going to grow roots.",
        "Markko: We could go ice skating. There's singing and stuff in Angel Square, we could go and do that.",
        "Langston: Yeah, no, that sounds fun. And it wouldn't take a lot of energy. Okay, look, I know that today sucked for everybody, but it's not going to get any better just sitting here.",
        "Markko: Okay, if Angel Square is lame, I'll join the Polar Bear Club tonight.",

        "Lola: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! I can't believe it. After everything that judge said, you're really going to marry my stepmother? This means we get to stay, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it's not a foregone conclusion, but we do have a pretty good shot. Especially if you guys get married before the hearing.",
        "Vanessa: Ma\u00f1ana?",
        "T\u00e9a: Si, ma\u00f1ana. I'll set up the ceremony. In the meanwhile, you and Cris need to learn everything there is to know about each other so you can convince the judge that you're the real deal.",

        "Dr. Levin: That's enough.",

And we're not talking about our nightmares, right, Brody? He walks around in the halls, all filled up with bullet holes, wondering, \"Why? Why did you kill me Brody?\" Isn't that right?",
