        "Nash and Layla weren't grooving on each other but they are liking each other now Jessica isn't amused. She tries to get Layla to leave with her but Nash offers to take her home. Jessica tells Antonio that she has made a mistake. She thinks that with all of Nash's baggage he may hurt Layla. Antonio doesn't understand then why she set them up. Todd rushes down from the rooftop. Blair and Spencer lay motionless. Spencer hears Todd arrive and go to Blair who is a few feet away from him. \"You killed her,\" Spencer says. Todd ignores him and tends to Blair. Todd calls for an ambulance and gives them the location. Spencer can't move but he can see Todd when he turns his head. He blames Todd for what he has done. When Todd tries to move Blair, Spencer tells him not to. \"What do you care?\" Todd snaps. Spencer says that he loves Blair and would give his life for her. He asks Todd if he would do the same. The sirens of the ambulance are soon heard and Todd takes a nearby garbage bag and throws it in Spencer's direction. It lands perfectly and Spencer is hidden from view. Spencer falls into unconsciousness, so when the EMT attendants arrive, they don't see Spencer Truman and Todd doesn't let on that the crazy bastard is there. Blair is loaded into the ambulance and carted off to the hospital. At the hospital, Blair is brought in and Michael puts Todd in the hall so that he can assess Blair's situation. Bo has gotten a call that there was an accident and that Spencer might be involved. He heads to the warehouse with backup and with guns drawn they start searching the area thinking that Spencer might be inside. \"Hey commissioner!\" Bo comes running. They find an unconscious Spencer laying with the garbage. Bo checks for a pulse. Todd is in the emergency room when Spencer is brought in. He just looks down at the man, unmoved. \"Where's you find Spencer?\" Todd asks Bo when he sees the man walking up. Bo isn't sure what happened at the warehouse, but he knows that Todd is under arrest for kidnapping. He gets the brass cuffs out and waves them at Todd. Todd says that Bo can't do this now. Blair is fighting for her life. \"You will have to shoot me to get me away from here.\" Bo says that he can arrange that. Bo is firm about taking the man in, and so Todd puts his wrists out to get cuffed. The door to Blair's room flies open and Blair is pushed out on her gurney. \"We have to get her to OR right away!\" someone shouts. The gurney stops momentarily so that Todd can talk to Blair who is now awake. \"You'll be okay,\" he tells her. \"Oh Todd,\" Blair whimpers. \"What about the baby?\" Todd's face goes pale.",

        "Spencer: And I threw him in the ocean.",
        "Blair: Get off of him, Spencer, you son of a bitch.",
        "Spencer: Now he's shark bait, you hear me?",

        "Roxy: Hey, what's up, toots?",
        "Jessica: Hi, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Whoa. Look at Layla and Nash getting their groove on. Do they look hot together, or what?",
        "Jessica: You really think so?",
        "Roxy: Ooh, yeah -- smokin'. Hmm. You know, when Nash lost Tess, he was like a sad little guppy, and I said to him, \"You got to forget about her and you've got to find somebody new.\" Looks like he took my advice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Look, I did not testify for Spencer. I did a psychiatric evaluation and I testified based on my findings. And I told the truth based on those.",
        "Starr: But that wasn't the truth -- he isn't insane. He was probably just doing that so that he wouldn't have to go to jail.",
        "Marty: And I respect your opinion, Starr. But in my professional opinion, Spencer Truman is very sick and he suffered a severe mental breakdown.",
        "Starr: Well, how is he sick in your professional opinion?",
        "Marty: Well, um -- there isn't really anything specific, but as with most cases, he had a very traumatic childhood.",
        "Starr: So did my dad. Does that mean he shouldn't be punished for what he did to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Blair! Blair!",
        "Todd: Blair!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Hey. Who is that?",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Marcie: Who's that? Is that Daddy? Is that Daddy?",
        "Michael: Look, it's my family.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Michael: How you doing, buddy? Hmm? How are you?",
        "Marcie: I'm okay.",
        "Michael: What are you doing here?",
        "Marcie: I brought my very handsome, hard-working husband some dinner.",
        "Michael: Oh, please. Tell me that this is a cheeseburger from Rodi's.",
        "Marcie: And a salad, but no French fries.",
        "Michael: No French fries?",
        "Marcie: You need your vegetables, Dr. McBain.",
        "Michael: Hmm, okay. Thanks anyway.",
        "Marcie: Hmm.",
        "Michael: Thank you, Tommy. But I bet you if Tommy had anything to say about it, there would be fries in this bag.",
        "Marcie: So, how's the E.R. going?",
        "Michael: Not too bad, you know, kind of slow. I've been catching up paperwork.",
        "Marcie: I -- I called Natalie a couple of minutes ago, you know, to see how John was doing. She said that he's giving her a very hard time.",
        "Michael: Yeah? Well, it's Johnny.",
        "Marcie: He's going to be okay.",
        "Michael: Yeah. You know, I keep praying that that's true. But I -- I wish I had some good news to tell him, you know, like Truman stepped off a curb and got smashed --",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: By a bus while on the run.",
        "Marcie: Michael, Michael, that's just bad karma. We don't need that.",
        "Michael: Yeah -- you want to know something, honey? I'm starting to not believe in this whole karma thing. I mean, this guy kills my father, lives a great life, and now he's going to go to some sanitarium where he gets to play golf and tennis all day? That is if they even catch this guy.",
        "Marcie: They're going to catch him, okay? Spencer is going to be punished for the crimes that he has committed, one way or the other. That, I am sure of.",
        "Michael: Where does that come from, that -- that undying faith of yours?",
        "Marcie: I get it from you.",
        "Michael: From me?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. You know, you make me believe that everything's going to be okay. I look at you and I -- I look at those cute little dimples.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: You make me positive, you make me optimistic. It's the reason that I married you -- well, it's one of the reasons.",
        "Michael: Yeah?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. What?",
        "Michael: I love you.",
        "Marcie: I love you, too.",

        "Jessica: So you told Nash to find himself a new girl?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Best way to get over a broken heart -- fall in love with somebody else.",
        "Jessica: When did you guys have this conversation?",
        "Roxy: I don't know. You know, all the days kind of run into each other. Let me think here -- oh, yeah, yeah. It was at Rodi's. It was while you were on your honeymoon. I had a real nice conversation with him. He's a great guy, and killer smile, not to mention that bod.",
        "Jessica: Okay, so, and you talked about his broken heart?",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. I accused him of still being in love with you.",
        "Jessica: What, with me?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, it wouldn't be so weird because Jess and Tess -- they are the same girl. I mean, I know Tess is gone, but she kind of got swallowed up in you or whatever --",
        "Jessica: Okay, um, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: What did Nash say when you accused him of being in love with me?",
        "Roxy: Oh, well, he got into this \"No way, Jose,\" but he did say that he was still in love with Tess, but Tess is gone.",
        "Jessica: That's true.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, fine -- you know, whatever you say. So that's why I said to him, you know, in order to get over Tess the mess once and for all, he's got to find a new chick. You don't got a problem with that, do you?",
        "Jessica: Me? No! Of course I don't have a problem with that. I mean, it was my idea to set Nash and Layla up in the first place.",
        "Roxy: Oh, you are good, because they are smoking together.",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah. Hey.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Antonio: Hey, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Hey, hot stuff.",
        "Antonio: What's going on? You enjoying the music?",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, man. I am grooving on it. I got to tell you your gorgeous other half over here, she did a good job fixing those two people up.",
        "Antonio: Uh, yeah -- yeah, they're hitting it off, aren't they?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Do you know, maybe you ought to have a dating service, you know, on the internet? And you could stay at home all day in your P.J.s and just make these love connections and I'd be the first to sign up. Of course, you got to give me a discount because I came up with the idea.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, and that -- that sounds like a good idea.",
        "Roxy: All right, I can see it now -- findasmokinhottie.com.",
        "[Antonio laughs]",
        "Roxy: What do you think?",

        "Bo: Starr, uh, what --",
        "Marty: Um -- look, Bo, it's not what you think. We just ran into Starr here.",
        "Bo: Oh. So were you here with someone?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I was with my friend Langston, but she left.",
        "Bo: Have you talked to your parents in the last couple of hours?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Bo: Do you have any idea where they might be right now?",
        "Starr: Why would you want to know?",
        "Bo: I believe that finding your mom and dad -- that could lead us to Spencer Truman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Please. Open your eyes. Please.",
        "Spencer: She's dead, Todd. You killed her.",
        "Spencer: You pushed us off the rooftop. You murdered her.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I need -- I need an ambulance right away. Uh -- uh -- the -- it's a -- it's a -- it's a warehouse complex. It's off of -- um -- it's off Route -- Route 9. There's been an accident, a terrible accident. You have to get here right now.",
        "Spencer: It was no accident.",
        "[Spencer chuckles]",
        "Todd: Uh -- well, she fell off the roof. Who? Blair, uh -- Blair Cramer! Uh, okay, hold on. No, I don't think she's breathing. I don't know. I don't know! I can't tell! Okay, just get here right now before it's too late. We got to get her to the hospital.",
        "Spencer: It already is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Wow. You do put your heart and soul into it, I'll give you that.",
        "Nash: Oh. But how about those facial expressions, huh?",
        "Layla: Yeah, you had some great facial expressions out there.",
        "Nash: Layla thinks I am a terrible dancer.",
        "Layla: No, I didn't say you were terrible. You asked if I thought you were good, and I said not really.",
        "Nash: You were being gentle on me. Admit it.",
        "Layla: Okay, fine. I admit it -- you are the worst dancer I've ever seen in my entire life.",
        "Nash: You see? Now we're talking.",
        "Roxy: Oh, don't listen to her, because nobody was looking at your feet, especially me. You two were real hot together.",
        "Layla: Thank you.",
        "Nash: Well, thank you, Roxy. I'm glad that somebody appreciates my unique talent.",
        "Roxy: Oh, I'll say that I do. All right. Merlot -- lighter and fruitier than carbonet with fab personality.",
        "Nash: Holy Roxy. Anytime you want another lesson, please, I --",
        "Jessica: What are you talking about?",
        "Roxy: Oh, he gave me a wine lesson -- merlot -- pinot greasy. What was that one that goes with vodka?",
        "Nash: Cranberry juice.",
        "Roxy: I guess I need another lesson.",
        "Layla: You know, Nash, I'd like to learn about wine. Would you consider taking on another student?",
        "Nash: It would be my pleasure. Anytime.",
        "Jessica: Nash is a great teacher.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. I mean, he's got such a great face that he can even teach gutting a mackerel. And if he did, I'd sign up like that.",
        "Nash: \"Gutting a mackerel.\"",
        "[Fast music plays]",
        "Layla: Wait a second -- another good song. Do you want to -- do you want to try to redeem yourself?",
        "Nash: Oh, listen, we all seek redemption, honey bunny.",
        "Layla: Let's go.",
        "Nash: Let's go.",
        "Jessica: Oh, guys -- it's getting late.",
        "Nash: It's barely time for me to get a wine. It's, like, 10:00 something.",
        "Jessica: I know. I -- it -- I'm sorry. Antonio and I told the sitter that we'd be home at 11:00.",
        "Roxy: Well, you should've brought the baby. You know, I used to take Nattie to all the clubs that I used to go to and she never cried at all. What'd I say?",
        "Jessica: Nothing, Roxy. It -- it's okay.",
        "Roxy: Well, you know I got hoof-in-mouth disease.",
        "Jessica: Don't worry about it. We should get going, though.",
        "Roxy: Oh, wait -- wait a minute. Wait -- all right, well, okay. You know, you and Antonio could go, but that doesn't mean that the party has to end, because I'm not done with my merlot, and Nash and Layla aren't done with their date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Why would my parents know where Dr. Truman is? It's not their fault he escaped.",
        "Bo: No. No, it's not. I wonder if they know where you are.",
        "Starr: Well, what does that mean?",
        "Bo: I just wonder if it'd be okay with them that -- that you're wandering around at night all alone, with Spencer Truman out there somewhere.",
        "Starr: They'd think that I'm at Langston's house.",
        "Bo: Oh, I see. Well, maybe that's where you should be, then.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but I can't because we got in a fight.",
        "Bo: I see. Okay, why don't I take you home?",
        "Starr: Oh, okay.",
        "Bo: Okay. Come on.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Bo: Uh -- excuse me just one second. Buchanan. I'm on my way. All right. Marty, could I talk to you for just a second?",
        "Marty: Of course.",
        "Bo: We got a 911 call at the station. It's about Blair -- she's had some kind of an accident.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God.",
        "Bo: I don't have any of the details right now, but judging from the location, I think it must have involved Spencer Truman some way.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Bo: Now, I don't want Starr to know about this. I don't want to upset her right now. Could she stay here with you, maybe have dinner?",
        "Marty: Oh -- yeah, yeah, of course. I'll -- I'll look after her.",
        "Bo: Okay. Thanks, Marty.",
        "Marty: Sure.",
        "Starr: Where did Bo go? Was it about Spencer?",
        "Marty: Um -- it could be. He's following a lead and that's all I know.",
        "Starr: Oh \u0096",
        "Marty: Um -- what were we talking about before Bo came in? That's right -- you asked me a question and I have not given you an answer yet, so why don't I buy us all dinner and we can talk?",
        "Cole: Dinner? But you just said that Starr and I shouldn't hang out together.",
        "Marty: I know, what I just said, but I'm going to make an exception.",
        "Cole: Why?",
        "Marty: Because I'm hungry and I said so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, okay, okay. Just hold on, Blair. Just -- just hold on. You're going to be just fine. It's just a couple of minor scrapes, no problem. You're going to be all right.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, good as new.",
        "Todd: You shut up and die already!",
        "Spencer: Hey --",

        "[Spencer moans]",
        "Spencer: Don't, don't -- don't move her. It's too dangerous.",
        "Todd: What do you care, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: I love her, Todd. I love her more than my own life. Can you say the same? Can you say you love her, Todd?",
        "[Siren]",
        "Todd: Blair, can you hear me?",
        "Spencer: Can you say you love her? You can't say it, can you?",
        "[Siren approaches]",
        "Spencer: That's what I thought.",
        "[Spencer coughs]",
        "[Siren stops]",
        "Todd: Over here.",
        "E.M.T.: What do you got?",
        "Todd: She fell off the roof. I don't know if she's breathing or not. I can't -- she have -- do you have a pulse?",
        "E.M.T.: We got a pulse, yeah.",
        "Second E.M.T.: All right, you get the C-collar; I'm going to get the backboard, all right?",
        "First E.M.T.: Okay.",
        "Todd: Well, hurry up!",
        "E.M.T.: What about you? Are you okay?",
        "Todd: No, I'm fine. Get the backboard.",
        "E.M.T.: Anybody else hurt?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Layla, honey, sit down. Sit down. Nash, you sit down. Finish this date -- or better yet, maybe you should light the trip fantastic on the dance floor. You like this song, right?",
        "Layla: Yeah, but we're --",
        "Both: We're not on a date.",
        "Roxy: If this isn't a date, what do you call it -- an appointment?",
        "[Nash chuckles]",
        "Roxy: A tea-to-tet? Well, you know, whatever the hell you call it, it looks like you two got good chemistry and you're having a load of fun.",
        "Antonio: You got a way with words, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: I know, thank you.",
        "Nash: You know, I wouldn't mind hanging out a little bit if you --",
        "Jessica: Oh, we came in the same car, so --",
        "Nash: Well, I got a car. I can give her a ride home.",
        "Layla: Yeah, that'll -- that'll be fine.",
        "Jessica: Okay, yeah.",
        "Antonio: Okay?",
        "Jessica: Well, then I guess we'll be leaving and see you guys later.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, you guys -- you guys have a good time -- you, too, Roxy. And the bill's taken care of, so order whatever you want.",
        "Roxy: Uh -- waitress? I'd like a case of merlot to go. I'm only joking. Oh, well, I got to go. See you soon.",
        "Jessica: Oh, wait. You're leaving, too?",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. I got to get up real early tomorrow. Hair Haven opens up at 11:00. I got to get my beauty rest.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but you just said you didn't finish your wine.",
        "Roxy: That's a good point.",
        "Roxy: All right, now that I've done that, um -- well, I'd tell you to have a very good time and don't do anything that I wouldn't do, which isn't much.",
        "Nash: See you, Roxy.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Take care.",

        "Michael: What do you say we head over to the five-star cafeteria cafe and have ourselves a couple of plates of meat brick? It's on special.",
        "Marcie: As tempting as that sounds -- doesn't that sound tempting? -- I think that we got to go home, right? Because you're getting very sleepy. I can see it.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: He's looking a little tired, isn't he?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Well --",
        "Michael: Are you tired, buddy?",
        "Marcie: We did have a very big day. I took him to the park, I took him to the playground. We went and got boots. We went boot shopping, didn't we? Yeah.",
        "Michael: And still you found time to come and see me.",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, I thought I'd spare you from the meat brick.",
        "Michael: How'd I get so lucky? Got a beautiful wife, a wonderful son.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, don't you forget it. Come here.",
        "Michael: You know, though, it is sort of starting to cause a little bit of a problem.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Michael: Well, some of the other physicians are getting a little jealous at the fact that I get home-cooked meals and they have to eat from the cafeteria.",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah.",
        "Michael: It's making it hard to maintain relationships.",
        "Marcie: Well, they haven't tasted my cooking, so --",
        "Michael: That's true.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",

        "Antonio: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: Want a cup of tea?",
        "Antonio: Sure. What, you disagree?",
        "Jessica: I don't disagree. No, no, they got along. They seemed to be having a lot of fun together.",
        "Antonio: But?",
        "Jessica: But -- nothing. I just -- I guess I just don't want Layla to get hurt.",
        "Antonio: Well, why would Layla get hurt?",
        "Jessica: Well, because Nash is on the rebound. I don't want her to be the rebound girl.",
        "Antonio: Well, why would you set Layla up with Nash in the first place?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: First, keeping the glass on the table, you swirl the wine.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "Nash: Next, you notice how the wine adheres to the glass. This is the wine's viscosity.",
        "Layla: \"Viscosity,\" right.",
        "Nash: Viscosity.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "Nash: As you can clearly see here, we have a wonderful cab of viscosity. Wonderful color. Blackberry and chocolate.",
        "Layla: It smells delicious.",
        "Nash: Drink.",
        "Layla: Finally. Mmm.",
        "Nash: Ah.",
        "Layla: It's good.",
        "Nash: You are a quick study.",
        "Layla: I can be. As long as there are no square roots involved. I'm terrible at math. You know what? Scratch that. I'm excellent at math. It's just boring. I'm terrible at being bored.",
        "Nash: Me, too. I get all in my head, and my head is a terrible place to be.",
        "Layla: Another thing we have in common.",
        "Nash: Definitely. Yes.",
        "Layla: It's funny, you know. I haven't been fixed up in a very long time.",
        "Nash: Really? Me, either.",
        "Layla: Last time, it was a total disaster. The guy was about a foot shorter than me, no sense of humor, and he was hard of hearing.",
        "Layla: And when we pulled up to the restaurant, he tripped out of the car and broke his arm.",
        "Nash: Sounds like a fantastic date.",
        "Layla: Well, I actually made up the broken-arm part. But he really was deaf.",
        "Nash: The question is, what did the person who set you up have against you?",
        "Layla: Crazy. You know, this is really going well, huh?",
        "Nash: Better than it started.",
        "Layla: Even though we said we're not on a real date. And I don't think that's what Jessica had in mind anyway. I think it's more she hoped we would be friends.",
        "Nash: Yes, that's -- that's probably what she hoped.",
        "Layla: Because I -- I'm not ready for anything serious, anyway. Not even dating. I'm just getting over a bad breakup.",
        "Nash: You want to talk about it? Because if you don't want to talk about it, you can --",
        "Layla: No, no, no. No, I -- I don't mind. It's Vincent. Did you know we were involved?",
        "Nash: Yeah. I thought he was head over heels for you.",
        "Layla: He came on really strong at first. So romantic. Always sending me flowers, telling me how much he was crazy about me. And then all of a sudden -- boom, it's over.",
        "Nash: Out of the blue.",
        "Layla: No. I had to break up with him because of what he did to Cristian. It's funny, you think you know someone, and then they turn out to be a totally different person. Everyone warned me against him, and I just -- just didn't listen.",
        "Nash: Huh. Well, no one knows what's right for you. You cared about him.",
        "Layla: Foolish me. I actually thought that he could have been the one. Do you know what that's like? You care about someone so much. And then all of a sudden, it's just over.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Yeah, I know exactly what that's like. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: This is where they found Blair Cramer.",
        "Officer: And Manning was the one who dialed 911?",
        "Bo: Yeah. It's the same warehouse where Spencer Truman delivered Margaret Cochran and Manning's baby. It was a son. My guess -- Manning hijacked Truman, brought him here to force him to tell Manning where his son is.",
        "Officer: Something went wrong.",
        "Bo: Yeah, it went real wrong, Mick. According to the 911 operator, somehow Blair Cramer either fell or was pushed off the roof.",
        "Officer: Think Spencer's still up there?",
        "Bo: I don't know. He could be. Or he could be inside. You two go around the back. I'm going to go in the front in three minutes, okay? Got it, Mick? Let's go.",
        "Officer: Commissioner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Okay, guys, come on. Hurry up. Get her into cubicle B. Come on. Move it!",
        "Todd: McBain, you got to save her.",
        "Michael: Get him out of here, now.",
        "Todd: No, I'm not going anywhere till I know she's okay.",
        "Michael: Look, we're not going to know if she's going to be okay for quite some time. Now, if you would just give me some room to work, please --",
        "Todd: Blair?",
        "Michael: Go!",
        "Todd: Sweetie --",
        "Michael: Gentlemen, will you escort Mr. Manning out of here, please?",
        "Todd: I'm not going to leave you, honey. I'm not leaving you, Blair. I'll be right outside.",
        "Spencer: Let go of me, Manning!",
        "Blair: Get off him, Spencer!",
        "Spencer: He's shark bait! You --",
        "Blair: Get off of him! Oh -- oh--",
        "Todd: What have I done? Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Do you not like your food? You haven't eaten anything.",
        "Starr: Um -- I'm not really hungry. I shouldn't have ordered. I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: No, no, that's okay.",
        "Starr: I'm just really worried right now, that's all.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Starr: Well, Bo seemed really upset about the phone call he got earlier, so I've been trying to get in touch with my parents ever since. All I've been getting is voicemail.",
        "Marty: Um -- you know, I'm sure that they are going to be calling soon. And you know, I still haven't answered your question. You -- you had said that your father had had a bad childhood, too. And if I thought because of that, that he shouldn't be punished for what he did to me.",
        "Starr: Well, what's the answer?",
        "Marty: There's no excuse for what your father did. There was no extenuating circumstances. And as a matter of fact, he wasn't punished for what he did. His prison sentence was cut short, dramatically so. So actually, he -- he didn't pay.",
        "Starr: You must have been pretty upset about that.",
        "Marty: I was. But I got over it, and I've moved on.",
        "Starr: Dr. Saybrooke, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what my dad did to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Where the hell did Spencer come from?",
        "Bo: I think you already know e answer to that question.",

        "Michael: He's outside.",
        "Blair: Oh.",

        "[Blair groans]",
        "Michael: You're in the hospital.",
        "Blair: What about -- what about the baby?",
        "Michael: What baby?",
        "Blair: Mine. I'm pregnant, Michael.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't know what you're talking about, Bo.",
        "Bo: Can the innocent act, Manning. I'm not sure what went down at that warehouse, but I am sure that you're under arrest for kidnapping Spencer Truman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I'm sorry I reminded you about Tess.",
        "Nash: It's all right. Everything reminds me of Tess.",
        "Layla: I heard about you two and how you met, and how complicated everything was.",
        "Nash: \"Complicated\" is an understatement.",
        "Layla: And it still hurts.",
        "Nash: I'm working getting over it. I'm lucky I have Bree and she's a part of Tess. She helps me get on with my life and makes it worth it.",
        "Layla: I bet she does. I saw you two together in the park.",
        "Nash: When?",
        "Layla: A few weeks ago on that random warm day. You two were sitting there, kind of dreamy.",
        "Nash: Why didn't you come by and say hi?",
        "Layla: Well, I was in a rush and I was walking to work. And besides, you two looked like you were having a great time, and I didn't want to interrupt.",
        "Nash: Well, we wouldn't have minded.",
        "Layla: Well, next time.",
        "Nash: Next time.",
        "Layla: Hmm. She seems like such a good-natured baby.",
        "Nash: Yes.",
        "Layla: Does she ever get cranky?",
        "Nash: Does she get cranky? With Tess and me as parents, it is a genetic requirement. You kidding me? But yeah, it doesn't last long. Baby faces and funny noises -- the requisite peek-a-boo thing -- hmm.",
        "Nash: And she's cheery again. She's a great kid.",
        "Layla: I bet you're a great father.",
        "Nash: Oh, \"great\"? No. I wouldn't say that. \"Amazing\" --",
        "Layla: Oh, really?",
        "Nash: Yes.",
        "Layla: Well, if you ever need to go out anytime, I am a world-class babysitter. You can add that on to one of my many hyphens.",
        "Nash: Well, thank you. If I have need I will, but I got to be honest. I doubt it. I relish every minute I get with her.",
        "Layla: Well, just in case. Emergency backup.",
        "Nash: You really need this?",
        "Layla: I really need what?",
        "Nash: I am a single dad with a broken heart. I'm not really available.",
        "Layla: And I told you before, I am not ready to be involved with anyone. But you are really great and sweet. And I actually would like to hang out with you sometime -- as friends, of course, if that's something that you might be interested in.",
        "Nash: Very much. Friends.",
        "Layla: Well, let's toast to that. To friendship.",
        "Nash: With benefits.",
        "[Nash chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know why I tried to set Layla up with Nash.",
        "Antonio: Well, I thought I did. But now you are afraid that Layla will get hurt by Nash, so I'm a little confused.",
        "Jessica: Fine, I didn't think it through. Okay? Of course I want Nash to find somebody, but after seeing them together tonight, I considered what might happen. I just don't think that Layla's the right person for him.",
        "Antonio: And isn't that for them to figure it out on their own?",
        "Jessica: Well, I wasn't going to interfere, Antonio, if that's what you're implying. You asked for my opinion, and I gave it.",
        "Antonio: Okay, there's no need to get defensive.",
        "Jessica: I'm not -- I just don't want you to misunderstand, that's it.",
        "Antonio: Oh. Fine, okay. Why don't we just stop talking about Layla and Nash, and focus on you and I, since we are right for each other?",
        "Jessica: That, I --",
        "Antonio: Perfect, in fact.",
        "Jessica: That's something I agree with.",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Antonio: So why don't we stop talking and concentrate on this? And on this.",
        "[Jessica giggles]",
        "Antonio: And on this, and this, and this, and this.",
        "Jessica: I love you, Antonio. I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Sorry? You did nothing wrong.",
        "Starr: I know. It's my father. And I'm a part of him, you know? And what he did was horrible. I feel so bad about it and whenever I think about it, I feel really sad, because I can't believe that my dad would do something so horrible. And I feel really bad for you, Dr. Saybrooke, that you had to go through something so humiliating. Look, I love my dad. And nothing will ever change that. And I know that he wasn't always a good person.",
        "Marty: Thank you, Starr. You are a very sweet, sensitive and intelligent young lady.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, no, Bo. No. No, no, no. Not now. Don't do this to me now.",
        "Bo: Manning, don't make this harder than it is.",
        "Todd: Blair is in that room fighting for her life at this moment. I'm not about to leave her. If you don't like it, you can shoot me.",
        "Bo: It can be arranged.",

        "Michael: We need to get her into O.R., stat.",
