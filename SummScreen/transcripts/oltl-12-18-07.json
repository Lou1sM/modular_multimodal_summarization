        "John: Hey. Good morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, what the hell were you thinking, Michael? You skip your court hearing, you leave the damn jurisdiction knowing the second you're caught you're going to be tossed in jail. Where the hell did you go?",
        "Michael: Paris, Texas.",
        "Rex: Because?",
        "Michael: Marcie.",
        "Rex: She was there? You saw her?",
        "Michael: No. But the last lead my brother gave me put Marcie in Paris, Texas.",
        "Rex: Come on. Michael, Marcie's been spotted in at least three separate states that we know of.",
        "Michael: You weren't there, Rex. I was. I know in my gut I was close to finding her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: $24 in breakage, Moe?",
        "Moe: I'm docking your pay, and if you break any more of my dishes today, you're fired.",
        "Marcie: Oh, Moe, I --",
        "Gigi: It's not like you've never had a case of the dropsies around here, Moe.",
        "Noelle: Tell it, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm. Guess who's all thumbs when a certain customer from Hollywood comes to town visiting in-laws.",
        "Moe: That's none of your affair.",
        "Gigi: I swear, if miss thing comes back one more time, this place will go belly up from all the damaged inventory. So don't feel bad. Just don't try to carry too many plates at one time, okay?",
        "Marcie: You're right.",
        "Moe: You --",
        "Noelle: What?",
        "Moe: I need you to work an extra shift today in case this one doesn't work out.",
        "Noelle: Oh, no, you don't. The judge is coming to taste our pies today, and there is no way you're getting between me and my perfect pie crust.",
        "Moe: Your pie crust is not my problem, Noelle.",
        "Noelle: And your lack of management skills isn't mine, Moe. But we both have to deal, don't we?",
        "Moe: I'm trying to run a restaurant here.",
        "Marcie: Thanks for saving my job. I need all the hours I can get before your friend Viki comes home and wants her job back again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Read the sign! Do not disturb!",
        "Charlie: Oh. Viki --",
        "Viki: Hello, Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Morning.",
        "Nash: Wow, look at this. Didn't waste much time getting these made up, now, did we, Uncle Jared?",
        "Jared: I had every right to get these made up, and if you're here to get on my case again, you know what?",
        "Jessica: We're not here to get in your face. That's not it at all.",
        "Jared: Then what? You guys here to welcome me with open arms?",
        "Nash: Gag me.",
        "Jessica: The point is, you got the D.N.A. test.",
        "Jared: I know what I did.",
        "Jessica: And those things don't lie. J",
        "Jared: Okay.",
        "Jessica: So no matter what we thought before --",
        "Nash: Or may still think.",
        "Jessica: Um -- Nash and I are here to officially welcome you to the family.",
        "Jared: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: How about getting Carlotta a really great vacation, like a cruise? What do you think?",
        "Cristian: Perfect.",
        "Antonio: Done. Sold.",
        "Cristian: Now all we have to figure out is where she'd like to go.",
        "Adriana: The Caribbean. I stopped in the diner on my way here.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. I love you.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm. Carlotta also mentioned making sure that Talia's coming to Christmas dinner.",
        "Antonio: No -- no, no, no. Yo no creo que -- que ella va a poder venir.",
        "Adriana: That's too bad. She also said something about Sarah.",
        "Cristian: Sarah is probably going to spend time with her family.",
        "Adriana: What is with you guys?",
        "Antonio: Nada.",
        "Cristian: What do you mean?",
        "Adriana: It's almost Christmas. Get happy, and if you're not happy, then just do what I'm doing and fake it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You know in your gut? What, are you a P.I. now?",
        "Michael: I'm Marcie's husband. More than that. I am her soul mate. It's like we knew each other before we ever met. I know what she's thinking. I know what she's feeling. And I know when she's near me.",
        "Rex: Okay. Psychic connections aside, what did running down to Texas accomplish other than getting you arrested?",
        "Michael: I wanted to see her and Tommy again. I wanted to help her.",
        "Rex: And being in a jail cell is helping her now?",
        "Michael: Okay. I know. I screwed up. I haven't exactly been thinking straight since the moment I found out that Todd was actually Tommy's father. I should have told her the truth. I keep thinking about last Christmas, you know, before I knew about Tommy and how happy we were, and how full of hope for the future. I can't stand the thought of Marcie out there, scared, broke, and having to hide with Tommy on Christmas.",
        "Rex: I wish there was something I could do.",
        "Michael: There is.",
        "Rex: Name it.",
        "Michael: I can't help Marcie from in here, but you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Moe: You plan on serving their breakfast for dinner?",
        "Marcie: Sorry, Moe.",
        "Gigi: Someone needs to give that man a chew toy.",
        "Noelle: Well, it's not going to be my blue ribbon, I'll tell you that.",
        "Moe: Want to bet?",
        "Noelle: Why gamble when I've got a sure thing.",
        "Gigi: Ugh. Lord, please let the judge come soon so I don't have to listen to any more bake-off drama.",
        "Marcie: It's a really big deal, huh?",
        "Gigi: Oh, it's only the Indy 500 of baking. Noelle's been runner-up for the past two years in a row -- so close to that prize money, and then Moe decides to horn in on the action, and they've been at it ever since.",
        "Marcie: Well, who do you think's going to win?",
        "Gigi: Who knows? Moe's the one who made Noelle feel proud of her baking, and now he's trying to outdo her. Anyway, just keep your head down and don't let either one of them trick you into saying who's the better baker, okay?",
        "Marcie: Got it. Thanks for the 411.",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie: So, is -- is Moe that mean all the time?",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, no, don't let him scare you. He's just a big pussycat.",
        "Marcie: Actually, I kind of like the way everybody relates around here, you know? It's like a -- like a big family.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I know that you're missing yours, and hearing those cops drag off your poor husband the other night a week before Christmas -- it's the worst, and I'm sorry.",
        "Shane: Hey, Mom. Hi, Sally Ann.",
        "Marcie: Hey, Shane.",
        "Gigi: Hi. They finally let you out for Christmas break, huh?",
        "Shane: Not before making us do a stupid Christmas pageant.",
        "Gigi: Someone didn't like being one of Santa's helpers?",
        "Shane: I'm starving. What's good today?",
        "Gigi: I'm hoping your report card. Come on, cough it up.",
        "Shane: Okay. Just don't get mad. Please?",
        "Gigi: \"Don't get mad\"? Hand it over. Oh, no.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. \"Particularly dislikes reading\"? \"Tutor recommended\"? I can't afford that.",
        "Marcie: This is great.",
        "Gigi: Excuse me?",
        "Marcie: Well, I have been looking for a way to repay you for everything that you've done for me, right? And now I found it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Cream, no sugar?",
        "Natalie: Thank you. You remembered.",
        "John: Not a whole lot I forget.",
        "Natalie: So I guess we should talk about this, huh?",
        "John: About what?",
        "Natalie: Hmm. That's right, you don't like to talk about things, especially when they're personal, so -- here. See ya.",
        "John: You sure you don't want any coffee? I made it myself.",
        "Natalie: Okay. I'll go first. So guess what I did last night. Well, I had a really bad day, and I got myself really, really drunk, and then I ended up sleeping with my ex.",
        "John: What a coincidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: What are you doing here?",
        "Viki: I'm visiting you.",
        "Charlie: No, you should go.",
        "Viki: Uh -- no. No, I -- I don't think so, not quite yet.",
        "Viki: Do you think we could just sit and talk for a minute?",
        "Charlie: Let me get this.",
        "Viki: Charlie, last time we spoke on the phone, you sounded so hopeful. You said you were going to meet your son. What happened?",
        "Charlie: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Charlie: He hates me. My son hates me.",
        "Viki: So, you -- you met him.",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah! I met him, I saw him, and then he sent me packing. But that was right after he told me he never wanted me to bother him again. Huh.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry.",
        "Charlie: Well, that's not the best part. You know, he's got a whole new life. I saw it with my own eyes. He's got a new business, new connections with the rich and snooty people.",
        "Viki: But -- but you know, that doesn't mean he -- that you can't be part of his life.",
        "[Charlie chuckles]",
        "Charlie: He said it in 10 different ways, and it was all just the same thing. He thinks I'm nothing more than a drunk. And he feels like he's given me too many chances already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Welcome to the family.",
        "Nash: We would like to invite you to a little holiday shindig at the cottage. Just a little Nat King Cole, a little eggnog, a little red wine, a little quality time with Bree. Bring a present. After all, you are her great-uncle.",
        "Jessica: It's not going be a big thing -- just you, me, Nash, and Bree.",
        "Jared: Hmm. Thank you. But I don't think I'm going to be able to make it.",
        "Nash: Oh, come on, what's the matter? Are you all booked up?",
        "Jessica: Well, you haven't been in town very long, and you don't know that many people, so what's wrong with a little night with family?",
        "Jared: Okay, you know what? You two have hated me since I rode into town, and I'm not saying that I blame you. But I sure as hell don't buy this 180. So tell me, what's going on here, huh? Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why don't we try a little give and take? You know, conversate.",
        "John: Let's do it.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Because I really got to wrap my head around this, about what happened. So, you know, what did happen?",
        "John: We were there. And you were there, and I was there, and then you -- and me, too. And -- look, we didn't plan anything, right? We were at that place, and then we ended up -- here, and that's what happened.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I wasn't that drunk. I remember everything that happened last night.",
        "John: Me, too.",
        "Natalie: So why did it happen?",
        "John: I was drinking by myself. I expected it to stay that way.",
        "Natalie: So -- here's a good one. It seems as though I've been making out with this guy who turned out to be my uncle.",
        "John: I think I'm going to need another round.",
        "John: It seemed like a good idea at the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What are you upset about?",
        "Adriana: I had a big fight with Dorian.",
        "Cristian: What did she do now?",
        "Adriana: She tricked me into thinking that she's really okay with Rex, and then -- you know what? It's not worth getting into.",
        "Antonio and Cristian: Okay.",
        "Adriana: But let me say one thing. You and Antonio are so lucky to have Carlotta. She supports you and she minds her own damn business.",
        "Antonio: Well, she's -- she's not Dorian.",
        "Adriana: Who is?",
        "Cristian: Well, she finitely makes her thoughts known.",
        "Adriana: Like the dinner invites for Talia and Sarah?",
        "Cristian: Listen, Adriana, you actually have a relationship for Dorian to interfere with.",
        "Adriana: Why doesn't she just give up? Nothing she's going to say about Rex -- his income, his lifestyle, his ability to commit -- nothing she's going to say is going to change my mind. So you know what? No matter what she says, Rex and I are going to have the best Christmas ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I want to hire you as a P.I.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Michael: You found out about Tommy before anybody else did.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and look how well that turned out.",
        "Michael: No, I made the decision to lie, not you. Come on, if anybody can find Tommy and Marcie before the F.B.I. and Todd's goons, you can.",
        "Rex: Michael, I don't --",
        "Michael: Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.",
        "Rex: Not a day goes by where I don't think of a way to make this right for you.",
        "Michael: No, you don't owe me anything, but you can help. You're a great P.I., Rex. You can get into places that the cops can't. You know how to talk to people; you know how to get them to trust you.",
        "Rex: You said Marcie was last seen in Paris, Texas, right?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Rex: Then it looks like I'm headed for Paris, Texas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: They're only accepting one entry per town, so it's either my pie, or Moe's.",
        "Moe: Don't worry about hurting her feelings. Go ahead. Tell the truth, shame the devil.",
        "Shane: Can't one of you pretend to be from Sulphur Springs or Texarkana?",
        "Moe: Hear that?",
        "Noelle: I am from Paris, Texas, born and raised. You're the Johnny-come- lately. You move.",
        "Moe: I can beat you now or beat you later. Either way, it doesn't matter.",
        "Noelle: I chopped up the pecans. Makes them easier to eat, and it brings out the flavor. Which one's better?",
        "Shane: The truth?",
        "Moe: You bet.",
        "Shane: I didn't like either of them. Sorry, I just don't like pie. I like cake.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. \"A little less talky, more worky,\" huh? Good job.",
        "Marcie: You're a little young to be looking for a job, don't you think?",
        "Shane: I'm looking for a movie to see.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Well, what kind of movies do you like?",
        "Shane: All the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies.",
        "Marcie: Cut it out -- me, too. Like, they're totally awesome. You must have liked that book -- \"The Pirate of Grover's Gulch.\"",
        "Shane: I never read it. Is it good?",
        "Marcie: Are you kidding? It's only the best pirate story, like, in the world. There's this kid, right? He's actually -- he's, like, about your age, and he goes into his backyard and he discovers this big treasure chest, but when he opens it \u0096",
        "Shane: What? What did he find?",
        "Marcie: No. No, I -- you know what? I don't want to spoil \u0096",
        "Shane: Come on, tell me.",
        "Marcie: No, I don't want to spoil it for you, but you have to read it. If you want to know what happens, you have to read it.",
        "Shane: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Moe: Sally Ann, back to work.",
        "Gigi: I forgot. You're a writer and a teacher.",
        "Marcie: Oh -- my former life.",
        "Gigi: Well, you could do it again.",
        "Marcie: I -- I need a license to teach, so -and -- and publishing -- I don't want to draw any attention to myself, so -- huh.",
        "Gigi: You've given up so much.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but not the most important thing in the world, right? My son. And don't you think it's worth the sacrifice?",
        "Gigi: All day long, honey. All day long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Last I heard, she was flat broke and scared that somebody was going to turn her in if she didn't pay them off.",
        "Rex: How did you hear that?",
        "Michael: I just -- I don't -- John must have told me or --",
        "Rex: Michael -- I need to know all of it if I'm going to help you find Marcie and Tommy.",
        "Michael: She called me again.",
        "Rex: After Thanksgiving?",
        "Michael: The day before I took off. She didn't sound good, Rex. She sounded desperate, alone. And you know what I told her? I told her she was on her own and she was endangering Tommy and that I wouldn't help her.",
        "Rex: You were just trying to get her to come home.",
        "Michael: No, I was angry and I shot my mouth off without thinking. And I woke up the next morning with the worst hangover, and I got a tip from a guy who had seen one of the fliers and I knew what I had to do.",
        "Rex: Did you get anywhere?",
        "Michael: I met a woman named Sally Ann. She lives in a motel across the street from a little cafe. I think she knows something.",
        "Rex: Good. I'm going to figure out how to play this and book the next flight to Paris, Texas.",
        "Michael: I can't tell you how much this means to me.",
        "Rex: It's nothing.",
        "Michael: With Christmas around the corner? You kidding? It's huge.",
        "Rex: Oh. Oh, I totally spaced. I'm sorry, Michael, I can't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So we had a few more drinks, poured my heart out to you.",
        "Natalie: You've been through hell. Want to talk about it?",
        "John: No. But I'll listen to you.",
        "Natalie: You sure?",
        "John: I'm sure.",
        "Natalie: Okay, here it goes. So you know, I -- this guy -- I -- we -- we were pretty into each other, wanted to see where it was going to go. Went over to ask him out for breakfast, and Nigel rips open this letter that reveals that Jared is my grandpa's long-lost son. My uncle.",
        "John: Disgusting.",
        "Natalie: Oh, it gets better. So -- um -- then tonight, he kissed me again, knowing we're related. Yeah.",
        "Natalie: I know that this is nothing compared to what happened to Marty.",
        "John: It's not nothing.",
        "Natalie: Look, to be going through what you're going through, I -- it can't be -- it can't be easy.",
        "John: I can't talk about it. I just can't.",
        "Natalie: It's cool. I understand. You know, we've been in the trenches together many a time, and I still care about you, so if -- I just want you to know, if you need to talk to me, you can talk to me about anything.",
        "Cristian: Hey, guys, it's past closing. Can I get you a couple of cabs?",
        "Natalie: Uh --",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, just -- okay, you know what? One's fine, thanks, Cris.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "John: Shh, shh, shh.",
        "[Natalie giggles]",
        "John: Come here. You didn't need to come all the way up here.",
        "Natalie: I just wanted to make sure you could walk okay.",
        "John: Irish blood, babe. We can always walk.",
        "Natalie: Right.",
        "[Key drops]",
        "[Natalie giggles]",
        "John: Ignore that.",
        "Natalie: Thank you. Thank you for listening to me, because I just don't think that I was ready to go home yet.",
        "Natalie: So that's what happened last night. So what happens now?",
        "John: I honestly don't know what happens next.",
        "Natalie: I think I do. I mean, I'm not sorry at all about what happened last night. I just think we were two people in a funny place, alone, not needing to be. So we found each other, again. But it won't happen again, because we're exes.",
        "John: No regrets, then?",
        "Natalie: None.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Ahem. You know, for what it's worth, I don't think that you shot Miles. I don't really know what happened, but I have a feeling it has something to do with protecting Cole.",
        "John: Well, for what it's worth, I'm sorry you're hurting about what happened with this fellow.",
        "Natalie: My luck, huh?",
        "John: You know, something better's going to come along. You deserve that. You deserve to be happy.",
        "Natalie: I just thought I was going to be happy with Jared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay, I won't lie to you. We still don't like you and we still would really like it if you disappeared.",
        "Nash: But since you're not going to disappear --",
        "Jared: Wow, what a way to welcome a guy to a family.",
        "Jessica: Hey, you asked for it straight and we gave it to you, you know? The truth is, the situation stinks, but it is what it is, so we're trying to make the most of it.",
        "Jared: This is a ringing endorsement for that holiday party.",
        "Nash: Let her -- let her finish.",
        "Jessica: Your D.N.A. says that you're a part of the family, and as you've probably already noticed, our family's pretty tight, and I adored my grandfather.",

        "Charlie: Oh, no, he of course reminded me of how I had broken his heart when he was a kid, how I'd always show up three sheets to the wind when I did show up. And -- you know how many times I -- I borrowed his allowance? All the promises I made that I just couldn't keep, and that's -- you know, that's -- that's when I wasn't being just downright mean.",

        "John: Oh -- so you're really involved over there.",
