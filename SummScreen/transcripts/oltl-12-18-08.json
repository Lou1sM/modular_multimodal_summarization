        "Dorian finds out from Mo that he values other things more than material wealth. Rex has a similar conversation with Noelle when he tells her how he is determined to find a very expensive Christmas gift for Shane to make up for the time they've lost. While Todd's trial is underway, Tea makes it clear that she will not allow her client to be railroaded nor denied a fair trial by the prosecution or the people that don't like him. After Antonio finds out that Cristian has married Vanessa in order to keep her safe from going back to Columbia, he tells his brother he could be in legal trouble as well as trusting a woman who may not be worthy of his trust."

        "Guard: Manning, wake up! You've got company.",
        "Todd: Who?",
        "Guard: Says her name is Margaret.",
        "Todd: Marty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: \"In a surprise move, Mr. Manning has retained his ex-wife, former Llanview resident T\u00e9a Delgado, to represent him in this case.\"",
        "Carlotta: I thought T\u00e9a said that Todd didn't want an attorney.",
        "Antonio: Well, it looks like T\u00e9a changed his mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I told you yesterday, I'm in. They don't suspect a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I knew it from the very beginning. The minute T\u00e9a showed up in Llanview, she was here to represent Manning.",
        "Carlotta: Did you see this?",
        "Cristian: No. I need to talk to you about something.",
        "Carlotta: What's wrong?",
        "Cristian: Nothing, nothing. In fact, it's good news. I'm getting married.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, you proposed to Sarah! Oh, that's wonderful. You love each other so much, I'm so glad.",
        "Cristian: No, Sarah and I broke up.",
        "Carlotta: What? You -- you're getting married, but you broke up?",
        "Cristian: I'm marrying Vanessa.",
        "Carlotta: Oh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Hey, Rex. What'll it be?",
        "Rex: Water.",
        "Noelle: Water, and?",
        "Rex: Water with a side of water.",
        "Noelle: That's all you want?",
        "Rex: I can't afford anything else. My bank account's empty and my credit cards are maxed out.",
        "Noelle: Oh, you poor thing, and it's the week before Christmas, too.",
        "Rex: And my kid wants a Z-box for Christmas. I'm trying to raise the cash --",
        "Noelle: A what?",
        "Rex: A Z-box? Never mind, it's a very expensive video game system. I'm trying to raise enough cash. I got to find one for him if it kills me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Cashmere socks. Oh, I know, I'll put them in the Christmas stockings. That'll be adorable. Mani-pedi spa certificates for the girls. That'll be great. Maurice? Moe? Did you make enough Christmas cookies so that I can drop some off at the neighbors'? There's something about homemade presents that's just so je ne sais quois.",
        "Moe: Soon as they're cool, they're going in the tins.",
        "Dorian: Wonderful.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Now, I still have to get two really special presents for the boys. Where are Santa's helpers when you really need them?",
        "Starr: Good morning.",
        "Dorian: Good morning, darling, and good morning, Cole. What a surprise. Would you like some breakfast?",
        "Cole: No, thanks, I'm not hungry.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you know, we'll probably grab something on the way there.",
        "Dorian: And may I dare ask on your way to where?",
        "Starr: We are going to my dad's hearing. And don't even try to talk us out of it. My mom already tried.",

        "Blair: And here I thought you hated the holidays.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Everything is going according to plan.",
        "Marty: I'm Marty Saybrooke, and you're the woman who's trying to set Todd Manning free. I think we should talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Marty?",
        "Margaret: You can call me anything you want, lover.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I put up half my life for auction last night. With a little luck, I'll raise enough cash to buy Shane the Z-box.",
        "Noelle: So, you're selling your stuff to buy Shane a computer game?",
        "Rex: It's worth it. Gigi can't afford it, and I've been out of commission the last few months, so neither can I.",
        "Noelle: Rex, I know you want him to be happy on Christmas morning but --",
        "Rex: Look, this is the first Christmas he's had a father. I was a no-show for 10 years.",
        "Noelle: I know better than anybody, that wasn't your fault.",
        "Rex: If I can just show him that -- he had this idea that his father was a hero. I may not be a Navy Seal, but if I can come through for him at Christmas --",
        "Noelle: He'll love you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: We didn't plan it, it just happened.",
        "Carlotta: But Sarah loves you.",
        "Cristian: Look, I'm really sorry about Sarah, but Vanessa and I love each other, and we're getting married -- today.",
        "Carlotta: Today? Dios mio. Is she pregnant?",
        "Cristian: No, no, she's not pregnant. Look, it's just that -- well, why wait?",
        "Carlotta: What's the rush? Will you talk some sense into your brother?",
        "Antonio: So, do you want to tell me what -- what's really going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: He did not give you dental floss on your date.",
        "Layla: Yes, and foot powder.",
        "Talia: Foot powder? Why would --",
        "Layla: Yes, yes.",
        "Talia: Hi.",
        "Layla: Uh, no. No, no, no -- no. When you didn't come home last night, I told Talia that you and Cristian made up.",
        "Sarah: I stayed at my Aunt Viki's.",
        "Layla: What happened? I thought you and Cristian were okay.",
        "Sarah: I don't think there can be a me and Cristian. He's marrying Vanessa.",
        "Talia: Did she just say --",
        "Layla: That he's marrying Vanessa?",
        "Sarah: It wasn't his idea.",
        "Talia: What, Vanessa asked him to marry her?",
        "Layla: And he couldn't say no?",
        "Sarah: He doesn't want to. It was all T\u00e9a Delgado's idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You and I shouldn't be talking, Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Marty: And you shouldn't be defending a psychopath, Ms. Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know you're friends with Nora Hanen, but if I were you, I wouldn't take your cues from her. Little chat she had with Todd in jail -- that's what allowed me to convince the judge to change Todd's plea from guilty to not guilty.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it was very clever, but not surprising, given your history with Todd. Married him for $5 million? And then fell for him? Not so clever. But typical of women who get too close to Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: I learned my lesson.",
        "Marty: That's why you flew in to defend him?",
        "T\u00e9a: Every defendant deserves --",
        "Marty: Deserves his day in court. No, that sounds like a woman who's learned her lesson. When exactly did you put it all together? Was it after he threw you out of his house half naked or was it after he punched you in the face? Or perhaps, it wasn't until he convinced you that he had a split personality, only he didn't.",
        "T\u00e9a: I see you haven't forgotten how to use the internet.",
        "Marty: You may know how to work the system, but I think you've forgotten what's important.",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you want, Marty?",
        "Marty: I want to know why you would defend Todd Manning after everything he's done to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Starr, hasn't there been enough drama and pain? T\u00e9a Delgado is just going to raise the ante.",
        "Moe: Sometimes, simple things like eggs over easy, bacon, and toast can make a bad day seem better. Sorry, Dr. Lord. Come on, kids, sit down.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: Cole -- how's your mother?",
        "Cole: Great. The amnesia hasn't let up, and now she has to be the star witness at the trial.",
        "Dorian: Would you like me to recommend a neurologist, a specialist who does research in this area?",
        "Cole: Yeah, that would be great.",
        "Dorian: Good.",
        "Starr: So T\u00e9a Delgado --",
        "Dorian: Oh, don't get me started on her. Oh, good.",
        "Cole: You think she's even going to make a difference? She's just a lawyer.",
        "Dorian: You'll learn that there are lawyers and then there are lawyers. T\u00e9a's clever, and she's ruthless, and she's got this really peculiar bond with your father. Anyway, here's the doctor's name. He has privileges at Llanview Hospital, the number's there, and also for his private clinic.",
        "Cole: Thank you.",
        "Starr: You know, T\u00e9a was so nice to us at the courthouse. She said how sorry she was that we lost the baby, but I still do not trust her.",
        "Dorian: See? You're a Cramer.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: I mean, you have got these instincts, and you have got to trust them.",
        "Starr: I know what my instincts are. We should be getting to that hearing.",
        "Dorian: Do you think your presence in the courtroom is going to change anything?",
        "Cole: Well, I want to be there for my mom, even if she doesn't really know me.",
        "Dorian: Cole, she's a very loving and sensitive person, and amnesia or not, she's been through a terrible ordeal. Maybe she just needs you to give her some space.",
        "Starr: Well, we both need to be there to make sure that my dad pays for what he's done.",
        "Dorian: If justice is served, he will.",
        "Starr: Well, he needs to know that he is not getting away with this.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Starr: It's not okay. And I'm going to make sure that he knows that I'm never going to let him hurt me or my brothers or anyone else ever again.",
        "Dorian: Your mother's right. You are our bright, shining star.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, what about his kids? And what he's done to them? I mean, she obviously thinks he's worth saving. For a smart woman, she's as dumb as they come.",
        "John: She seems to know her way around a courtroom.",
        "Blair: It's probably not the only room that she knows her way around. Okay, you know what? I'm being catty. I can be a mean girl when I have to. But come on, John, I mean, how many women have to come back from Todd's past and wreck everything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Margaret, what do you want?",
        "Margaret: You. I want a second chance.",
        "Todd: No, get off me. Ooh, you're dead.",
        "Margaret: And you're as cute as ever. Oh, don't push me away, Todd. We had a child together. We were lovers. I want a do-over.",
        "Todd: Lovers, my ass. And you don't get any do-overs, you're dead.",
        "Margaret: Admit it, Todd, if things were different, you would want me.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: I've never wanted you, Margaret. You raped me, remember?",
        "Margaret: And you raped Marty, too, but she gave you a second chance, and you fell in love. That's all I want, Todd, is to fall in love with you again.",
        "Todd: Just get out of my head, Margaret. You're not real.",
        "Margaret: It's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I know I can't buy my kid's love, but if I could at least be the one to put a smile on his face Christmas morning, is that so terrible?",
        "Noelle: Oh, honey, I get it. I was there for some of those holidays with Gigi and Shane, and it was tough. I mean, she'd be pulling extra shifts, walking to work. One time, she even cut her own hair. And she still couldn't afford those expensive, electronic doodads that all the kids wanted. And Shane, well -- he was a trooper, don't get me wrong, but, well, he's a kid. It had to hurt.",
        "Rex: That's all I'm saying. I just want to make a difference in their life.",
        "Noelle: One year, ugh, when Gigi opened a Christmas account, she was not going to get caught short again. She saved up $500. Then Shane had one of his asthma attacks, and her insurance wouldn't cover it for some dumb reason. Gigi ended up on the hook to the E.R. for over 1200 bucks. Christmas that year? We're talking a baseball and a couple of framed photos. It was bleak. I caught Gigi in the backroom crying her eyes out into a dish towel. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Look, Vanessa and I spent some time together in Colombia -- not that anything happened. I wouldn't do that to Sarah.",
        "Antonio: Right, because you love her.",
        "Cristian: Because I wouldn't do that. But Vanessa saved my life, and then we got back here, we got close, and -- I'm sorry about Sarah, but --",
        "Antonio: Look, save it, okay? You're doing it so that Vanessa and Lola don't get deported.",
        "Cristian: We're not having this conversation.",
        "Antonio: Yes, we are.",
        "Cristian: Antonio, you're a cop. You're the chief of detectives. I'm not discussing this with you. I'm not getting you involved.",
        "Antonio: I'm your brother.",
        "Cristian: I didn't have a choice.",
        "Antonio: There are worse things than getting deported.",
        "Cristian: You're right, there are. Like Vanessa getting a death threat right before the hearing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Okay, so he shows up at the deportation hearing and tells the judge he's marrying her?",
        "Sarah: Yep. So she can stay here in this country instead of going back to the dangers of Colombia. But you didn't hear that from me.",
        "Talia: Yeah, um, there's a -- there's a problem with this plan.",
        "Layla: Uh-huh, aside from the fact that it is illegal, and he's breaking your heart.",
        "Talia: The problem is, that whoever's threatening Vanessa is obviously already here.",
        "Sarah: I didn't say it made sense.",
        "Layla: So what are you going to do?",
        "Sarah: If he goes through with it, I don't know, I -- I guess we're done.",
        "Talia: Who is this T\u00e9a Delgado person?",
        "Sarah: Apparently, she's Vanessa's lawyer.",
        "Talia: So wait, she's representing Vanessa now?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, I guess. If she hadn't shown up, they would be back in Colombia by now.",
        "Layla: Oh, honey, than this T\u00e9a's got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: She's a shark. And I know, all lawyers are sharks, but she takes the cake. I mean, you know what, if she gets Todd off, what happens to my kids, huh? I mean, at least if he's put away, locked up, there's a chance that they're going to have, like, a halfway normal life. But if T\u00e9a Delgado puts him back out on the streets --",
        "John: Push her out a window?",
        "Blair: Don't you hit me.",
        "[T\u00e9a screams]",
        "Blair: You know about that?",
        "John: Yeah, someone might've mentioned it to me.",
        "Blair: That window thing -- that was -- an accident.",
        "John: Well, remind me to stay on your good side.",
        "Blair: Come on, John, you know I'd never throw you out a window.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margaret: I'm in your head for good, Todd. We had a child together, which is more than you and Marty can say. Besides, I've changed.",
        "Todd: No, you haven't changed.",
        "Margaret: And if I were still alive, I would be different.",
        "Todd: You haven't changed, and I'll never want you. You just -- you make me want to puke, Margaret. If you weren't already dead, I'd kill you.",
        "Margaret: Now you know how Marty feels.",
        "Guard: Manning! It's time for court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't fly to Todd's defense. I happened to be in town when I heard that he was in jail. I visited him out of curiosity more than anything else, but when I learned that he wasn't hiring an attorney, it became clear to me that he was in some kind of altered state. And no, by that, I don't mean that he was unable to tell right from wrong. I mean, he was unable to act on his own behalf, which is why I stepped in.",
        "Marty: I see, so you're just an angle of mercy.",
        "T\u00e9a: Every defendant deserves --",
        "Marty: You? I admit I fell for him, but I didn't know what he had done to me. I didn't know who he was. You knew everything about Todd. How could you let yourself get involved with him?",
        "T\u00e9a: He can be very charming. I guess I overestimated my ability to walk away from him.",
        "Marty: Well, I couldn't walk away from him. And when I could move around, he posted a guard, an armed guard outside my door, which means effectively, I was a prisoner. And then he lied to me. He told me I had no friends, he told me I had no family. And then he brainwashed me into believing that he was the only one that could keep me safe from enemies that he invented. That's why I believe that he raped me all over again. And you want to defend him? How could you possibly think you are doing the right thing?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm just curious, Marty. Are you angry at me for representing Todd or are you just jealous as hell that once upon a time he was all mine.",
        "[T\u00e9a grunts]",
        "Nora: Marty \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Starr, you sure you wouldn't like to come Christmas shopping with me?",
        "Starr: Hmm, I'm positive. We have to get to the courthouse, but thank you so much, aunt Dorian, and thank you, Mr. Stubbs.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it was great, thank you.",
        "Moe: Call me Moe.",
        "Dorian: Call him Maurice.",
        "Moe: Lunch is at 1:00 if you're hungry.",
        "Starr: Thanks. Bye.",
        "Dorian: Bye.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Dorian: Maurice -- would you like to come shopping with me?",
        "Moe: Me? I've already got everything I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Rex, if I had the money for this Z-whatever, I'd give it to you.",
        "Rex: Bo's already offered, but I can't take somebody else's money. That's the point; it has to come from me. My bank account's empty.",
        "Noelle: Mine, too. This move wiped me out, and with the economy the way it is, people are not eating out, and when they do, they're not tipping.",
        "Rex: Tell me about it. Ultraviolet's about as popular as the morgue. I still got to figure out a way to pay my staff, the electric bills, the vendors. Ugh, I can't think about this right now. I need to focus on the task at hand, and that is selling everything I own for Shane.",
        "Noelle: Well, what do you got? Maybe I can buy something.",
        "Rex: Uh, okay. Are you in the market for a vintage T-shirt collection? No, no, no. CDs, I have everybody.",
        "Noelle: You got any Dixie Chicks?",
        "Rex: No country, sorry. How about a flat-screen TV?",
        "Noelle: I'd love to, but I can't afford it.",
        "Rex: Whoa. Minx35 can. Okay, somebody just bid $500 for my TV.",
        "Noelle: Oh, how much did you pay for it?",
        "Rex: Well, 1,000, but 500 will buy me a Z-box. Okay, uh, sold. Money goes into my checking account. Yes, okay, boom. I've got to get to the mall. What do I owe you for the water?",
        "Noelle: Oh, honey, it's on the house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: This T\u00e9a is not the problem. She's just a lawyer. Vanessa is the real snake.",
        "Talia: Honey, do you think anything's happened?",
        "Sarah: What, besides the hug and the walking around the apartment half naked and the whole getting-married thing?",
        "Layla: Okay, I'm sorry, but that requires a serious explanation.",
        "Sarah: Okay, well, the hug was apparently completely innocent. He was just comforting her. And the whole \"walking around half naked\" thing is, uh, I don't know, the way Vanessa dresses, all the time. There's a serious lack of wardrobe going on.",
        "Layla: And now, he's marrying her.",
        "Sarah: Do you guys think I'm wrong to not go along with this?",
        "Talia and Layla: No.",
        "Sarah: So you don't think I'm being jealous and selfish and paranoid?",
        "Talia and Layla: No.",
        "Sarah: So if he does this, I have to break up with him, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: The note was shoved under the door.",
        "Antonio: Okay, why didn't you tell me?",
        "Cristian: There wasn't time.",
        "Antonio: Or bring it to the attention of the judge?",
        "Cristian: I did. The guy couldn't have cared less.",
        "Antonio: Okay, I'll need the note. I'll get it to forensics, see what I can get.",
        "Cristian: I don't have it.",
        "Antonio: Well, where is it?",
        "Cristian: I gave it to T\u00e9a.",
        "Antonio: What is she doing with it?",
        "Cristian: Well, she's sort of representing Vanessa.",
        "Antonio: Wait a second; is this whole thing her idea? This whole bogus marriage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay, Marty, step back, step back, step back.",
        "T\u00e9a: Get your client under control or I will file charges against her.",

        "T\u00e9a: Your friend Marty Saybrooke just hit me.",
        "John: You okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm fine. Thank you so much for caring.",

        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
