        "Markko: I'm supposed to be working.",
        "Langston: So? I'm supposed to be studying.",
        "Markko: If Carlotta finds out--",
        "Langston: Oh. No flan for a week? We'll survive.",
        "Markko: We shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Langston: You've never had any complaints before.",
        "Markko: Yeah, well, that was then. And tonight was Delphina. And remember what she said? That you Cramer women are in danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well?",
        "Mitch: Hmm. Very avant-garde. Who's the artist?",
        "Dorian: You are no artist. You're a sadist.",
        "Mitch: You think I did this?",
        "Dorian: Of course I do.",
        "Mitch: But why would I desecrate such a beautiful family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't do this tonight.",
        "Blair: I'm not here to fight.",
        "T\u00e9a: Good, because I'm going to bed.",
        "Blair: No. If you don't let me say what I need to say, I might not say it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Even better.",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Who's she?",
        "Todd: You weren't supposed to see that.",
        "Starr: Why not?",
        "Todd: Because it's none of your business.",
        "Starr: Dad, you're carrying around a picture of a girl who's young enough to be your daughter.",
        "Todd: I'm not dating her.",
        "Starr: No?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Starr: Okay. Then who is she?",
        "Todd: She's T\u00e9a's daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: There you are.",
        "Clint: Nora.",
        "Nora: Nigel said you were working, but what are you doing in bed? Are you not feeling well?",
        "Kim: Honey, I can guarantee you he's never been better.",
        "Nora: What the hell?",
        "Clint: Well, I guess she caught us.",
        "Nora: What is this?",
        "Clint: What does it look like? Like I'm having an affair?",
        "Nora: Hey, that's mine.",
        "Kim: Fine.",
        "Nora: No, no, no, keep it. Close it. Who is this person?",
        "Clint: Sorry. You haven't met. It's my new assistant.",
        "Kim: Kimberly Andrews.",
        "Nora: What happened to Sandra?",
        "Clint: She retired, so I hired Kim. She's been doing very well. Mind like a steel trap.",
        "Nora: Oh, yes. I can see it's her mind you're drawn to.",
        "Clint: Oh, and Kimberly's full of surprises. I'm sorry. I would've introduced you sooner, but you were never around. You were always jetting off somewhere with Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, Nora. I guess your phone ran out of juice again, huh? Well, all's well here. The kids are sitting down to order dinner, and I got to make a call to the department, check in. Other than that, we're just here at the Buenos Dias. Do me a favor. Would you call after you talk to Clint about Danielle moving in? And, um, I miss you.",
        "Nigel: Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Destiny.",
        "Destiny: I need to tell Matthew how I feel about him, and you're not gonna talk me out of it.",
        "Nigel: Yeah, I see. Well, far be it for me to interfere in the love life of a Buchanan, but--",
        "Destiny: Is he upstairs?",
        "Nigel: Matthew has returned from Seattle, but he went out for a bite to eat.",
        "Destiny: Where'd he go?",
        "Nigel: I believe he said something about the Buenos Dias Cafe. But he is with our new houseguest: Miss Danielle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I'm sorry I'm such a downer.",
        "Matthew: It's not like you don't have a reason. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Dani: It's okay. It's not like I can pretend it didn't happen. My father was murdered. He's gone. I couldn't even--",
        "Matthew: It's gonna be okay.",
        "Dani: How? He's dead! And everyone's glad except for me! He didn't even get a funeral! I couldn't even say good-bye, and nobody cares, not even my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You came here to apologize?",
        "Blair: Yes. Well, is that so hard to imagine?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, the last time you \"apologized\" to me, it felt more like an assault.",
        "Blair: Well, you hit me first.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you just told me you'd slept with Todd.",
        "Blair: And I was apologizing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. Good-bye, Blair.",
        "Blair: No, no, no, no, no. T\u00e9a, this time it's different. I--you're right. The last time I was rubbing your nose in it because you were so smug and aggravating.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. So this is all my fault?",
        "Blair: You bring out the worst in me. What can I say? Let's just take Ross, for instance. I never would've sent him to Seattle if you hadn't have just pissed me off.",
        "T\u00e9a: Let me know when you start apologizing.",
        "Blair: No, T\u00e9a! I was wrong. I was wrong. Todd and I have used our children to hurt each other more times than I even care to count, and it is wrong. The only people that end up getting hurt are the children. And nothing ever-- nothing ever seems to be settled. So the long and short of it is that I'm so sorry that I drug Dani into all of this and, well, I hope that you can forgive me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that it?",
        "Blair: More or less.",
        "T\u00e9a: Apology not accepted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: T\u00e9a has a daughter?",
        "Todd: Yep. Surprise, surprise.",
        "Starr: How long have you known about her? What's her name?",
        "Todd: Danielle. I met her about a week ago in Seattle.",
        "Starr: So that was T\u00e9a's big, dark secret? Not that she was stealing your money, but that she has a daughter?",
        "Todd: She wasn't after my money.",
        "Starr: So Mom was lying? Oh, my God! So where has she been all this time?",
        "Todd: Recently, boarding school.",
        "Starr: Okay. Well, who's her dad? I mean, she does have a dad, right? Who's he?",
        "Starr: So who's her dad? Do we know him?",
        "Todd: Danielle's dad is--well, she grew up in Tahiti. They were all in Tahiti together: T\u00e9a and Ross and--and Danielle.",
        "Starr: Oh, Ross Rayburn? The one who was on the island with you and T\u00e9a. So that makes sense, the timing and everything like that. So T\u00e9a's married to Ross Rayburn...",
        "Todd: They're not anymore.",
        "Starr: What? The divorce went through?",
        "Todd: No. I don't know. Maybe.",
        "Starr: Is she married to him or not?",
        "Todd: No, no. He's dead.",
        "Starr: He's what? How?",
        "Todd: I killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You can't not accept my apology.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you really think an \"I'm sorry\" could settle all of this? You--you screwed up my divorce. You destroyed my marriage to Todd, told him that Ross and I were trying to steal his money.",
        "Blair: Well, I can't help it if Todd was stupid.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you played Todd, and you know it!",
        "Blair: Well, Todd is Todd, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. You are you, and God help you both!",
        "Blair: Oh, so you're perfect?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't deliberately hurt people! You sent Ross after Daniella and me!",
        "Blair: I didn't know that he had anger management issues.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ohh--",
        "Blair: Listen, I apologize, and I'm truly, truly sorry.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, Daniella won't even speak to me! The only father she knows is dead, Blair!",
        "Blair: Well, then you're just gonna have to take that issue up with Todd. T\u00e9a, come on. As far as Daniella is concerned--listen, I know what it's like to have a teenage daughter that thinks that she hates you. And if I could say anything to her or to help you get through to her, then I will.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine. Apologize to her. Explain to her why her father is dead. Tell her that you would do anything to get your hooks back into Todd, that you're the reason her father is dead!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Your dad didn't deserve what happened to him.",
        "Dani: Not according to my mom.",
        "Matthew: Look, forget your mom. Just because she's not planning a memorial for him doesn't mean we can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: So Laurence is gonna make it?",
        "Officer: Commissioner, the docs say he should pull through.",
        "Bo: That's too bad.",
        "Officer: Sir?",
        "Bo: Is that it?",
        "Officer: Well, he has a visitor, the mayor.",
        "Bo: Dorian Lord? That mayor?",
        "Officer: I tried to stop her, but--",
        "Bo: I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I would never do anything to harm the Cramer girls unlike the person who sent this card. He--or she--clearly has no concern for their safety.",
        "Dorian: You and I both know you are the one who sent that card. Do I need to remind you that I am now mayor of Llanview? Do you have any idea what that means?",
        "Mitch: All hail the powerful Dorian. I've been thinking of nothing else: You in all your glory, and how much you're going to help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I thought I was superstitious.",
        "Markko: I'm not superstitious.",
        "Langston: Then why are you buying into everything Delphina says?",
        "Markko: Look, she's never wrong.",
        "Langston: Except when she's lying, which she totally admitted.",
        "Markko: Still...",
        "Langston: Still nothing. The whole thing was just a scam to get back at Dorian for marrying Amelia.",
        "Markko: Okay. So tell me this. How come you always believed her before?",
        "Langston: Okay, I'll believe anything that's good. All right? But when she goes on about all this death and destruction, anybody could say that. It's the good stuff that takes real talent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All right. You know, I got to check on something. It's police business. You two go ahead and just get whatever you want, all right? Son, just cancel my burger and fries.",
        "Matthew: You're not coming back?",
        "Bo: No, no, no. I'm gonna come back. I'll pick you up. Just text me, okay?",
        "Matthew: So then I'll get them to go.",
        "Bo: You are a keeper.",
        "Dani: So he's the guy you were running away from? He's great.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, he is. So what do you think? You want to have a memorial for your dad?",
        "Dani: You'd do that for me?",
        "Matthew: After what you did for me? Come here. Check this out. Look.",
        "Dani: Ohh--looking good!",
        "Matthew: Yeah. So just pick a date and we'll set it up.",
        "Dani: You're the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So all of this is revenge for me being out of town?",
        "Clint: She was gone an awful lot.",
        "Kim: When was she here?",
        "Nora: Can we not do this with her here?",
        "Clint: All right. I'm sorry. Kimberly, will you excuse us? I need a moment with my wife.",
        "Kim: Whatever you need. Do you mind? I need a little privacy myself.",
        "Nora: I beg your pardon?",
        "Clint: The lady needs to get dressed.",
        "Nora: The lady is dressed.",
        "Kim: And she can wait in the hall.",
        "Kim: Somebody's unhappy.",
        "Clint: You okay?",
        "Kim: Yeah. She doesn't scare me.",
        "Clint: Good. I want to thank you. I appreciate your enthusiasm. I haven't felt this good in an awfully long time.",
        "Kim: Well, if you were my man, you'd feel like this all the time.",
        "Clint: Listen, Kimberly, you can look forward to a raise. I mean, Lord knows that you've earned it.",
        "Kim: Just know I'm always here for you. Whenever you need me, big guy, just call.",
        "Clint: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What the hell was that?",
        "Clint: My assistant.",
        "Nora: Oh, \"your assistant,\" my ass. What the hell is going on here, Clint?",
        "Clint: Are you sure you want to know?",
        "Nora: Yes, I want to know!",
        "Clint: All right. It started the night before our wedding.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Clint: The party at the lodge? I went for a walk in the woods just to get some air and clear my head because I've been having some doubts.",
        "Nora: Well, why didn't you say anything?",
        "Clint: I don't know. I guess I just didn't trust you. I couldn't bring myself to talk to you, so I went for a walk, and I ran into Kim. And we walked along together, and then something happened. And I stopped her, and in the moonlight, we kissed. And I thought about telling you later that night, but I didn't think that you would understand. So I went through with it and I married you, and it was okay at first. You know, I could play that I was being happy. But every time I would see Kim, I wanted her more and more. And I could tell I was falling in love with her and out of love with you. But you know that, firsthand, how those things work, don't you, Nora?",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. You know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Me? Help you?",
        "Mitch: Yeah. It'll be fun.",
        "Dorian: Hmph. It'll never happen.",
        "Mitch: Oh, come on. Think of the possibilities: Your power, your access, my genius.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha! Really? Your \"genius\" landed you in the ICU chained to a hospital bed.",
        "Mitch: Don't underestimate me, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Don't insult me, Mitch.",
        "Mitch: Whoever sent you that card is clearly deranged. Fortunately, I have experience with troubled souls. I can rein them in.",
        "Dorian: From the ICU chained to your hospital bed?",
        "Mitch: You're wondering how I would know that Starr is at home with her father, that Langston is at the quaint Buenos Dias cafe with her boyfriend Markko, and that Blair is visiting T\u00e9a Delgado at the Palace Hotel.",
        "Dorian: If that is true...",
        "Mitch: How would I know chained as I am to my hospital bed?",
        "Dorian: What do you want?",
        "Bo: Well. The mayor and the Mitch. What do we have here? Is this a meeting of the minds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Admit it, Blair. You would do anything to get Todd back. You're willing to hurt anyone. Not even Todd is safe. You would ruin his life before you'd see him be happy with someone else.",
        "Blair: Well, what do you want me to say, T\u00e9a? That I got in your way, huh? Is that what you want me to say? Okay, I did. I got in your way, and people were hurt. I wanted him back. And I did things, yeah, that I'm not proud of to make that happen. Ross might still be alive if it weren't for me. Danielle might not hate you. Todd might not hate either one of us, and I might not hate myself, if I just let you have Todd. But I didn't, did I? I got busy, and people got hurt. Now, are you satisfied? Does that change anything? Does that make you any less responsible in all of this? Because, yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm guilty. But you're in this just as deep, T\u00e9a. Because I may have fought hard and played dirty, but you've been lying to Todd for 15 years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Ross kidnapped his own daughter and Mom?",
        "Todd: Yeah. He was panicking. And he knew there was no way out, and he was gonna force Danielle over the bride with him.",
        "Starr: He was gonna kill his own daughter?",
        "Todd: Yeah. He kept insisting they'd be okay, but he was really losing it. Of course, I couldn't let that happen.",
        "Starr: No. Of course you couldn't.",
        "Todd: I had a gun. I told him I'd shoot him with it, and I tried to stop him. And I was only trying to wing him, really.",
        "Starr: And Danielle...",
        "Todd: Just watched him disappear into the river.",
        "Starr: But you saved her life.",
        "Todd: She hates me for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Welcome home!",
        "Matthew: Destiny. Hey. How are you?",
        "Destiny: Fine. I stopped by your house. Nigel said you'd be here. He didn't say anything about Danielle. Hi.",
        "Dani: Hello.",
        "Matthew: Uh, Danielle's staying with us. So what's up, Des?",
        "Destiny: Nothing. I wanted to talk to you about something.",
        "Matthew: What?",
        "Destiny: It can wait. So what happened? You obviously got rescued.",
        "Dani: Hardly.",
        "Destiny: Well, you're here, aren't you? I mean, it's better than being dragged around at gunpoint. So what happened to your crazy father when the police caught up with him?",
        "Matthew: Destiny--",
        "Destiny: He's going to jail, right?",
        "Dani: Wrong.",
        "Destiny: Why not? He pulled a gun on me!",
        "Dani: My father's dead, okay?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Good heavens. What happened to your clothes?",
        "Kim: I took them off.",
        "Nigel: Yes, I can see that. The question is, why?",
        "Kim: Ask your boss. It was his idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What is it you think I know? Let's hear it.",
        "Nora: Clint, please.",
        "Clint: And, Nora, I'm not gonna take pity on you.",
        "Nora: I don't want your pity. I want you to understand.",
        "Clint: Then you should've talked to me, respected me, refused to marry me, but you didn't. And you couldn't tell me that you were having doubts that night at the lodge and that you had kissed my brother. And you couldn't tell me at the church rectory. You couldn't tell me at the altar, the reception, or even later that night when we were in bed?",
        "Nora: I loved you. I married you because I loved you.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah? Then why were you carrying on with my brother? And all the while letting me think that the two of you were just sick with grief over your son?",
        "Nora: We were grieving. And you're right. I was wrong not to have told you that I was confused. And how confused I was, and that I--I had these feelings. But I didn't even understand them. I didn't even know what-- what these feelings were or if they were even real. What I did know was that I loved you and you loved me, and that's all that mattered. So I brushed aside those doubts. Because that's all they were...",
        "Clint: Uh-huh?",
        "Nora: Doubts.",
        "Clint: You still have doubts, Nora, or are you sure? Oh, come on. For once in your life, have the guts to tell me the truth.",
        "Nora: Fine. I'm in love with your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Why are you here, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: I'm here in my capacity as mayor.",
        "Bo: And what capacity is that?",
        "Dorian: I want to make sure that Llanview's most notorious criminal is secure.",
        "Mitch: And you're interrupting a private conversation. Ugh!",
        "Bo: You're a prisoner. You have no right to privacy.",
        "Mitch: Mayor, I appeal to you.",
        "Dorian: The police commissioner is just doing his job.",
        "Mitch: Oh. So this is the kind of police reform you talked about in your campaign? This conversation's over.",
        "Dorian: It's over when I say it's over.",
        "Mitch: Come, now, Commissioner. There must be other affairs for you need to attend to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Believe me, Clint. We didn't plan it. It--it just happened. We didn't-- we didn't even know what it was at first. We thought it was just--it was just all the grieving over Matthew and spending all that time together. We even talked about it, and we decided that we--we just wanted to stay friends.",
        "Clint: How did that work out?",
        "Nora: I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you. There just was always a crisis, you know. First, Jared, and Natalie and Jessica were missing, and Matthew.",
        "Clint: Oh. You're gonna blame this on Matthew?",
        "Nora: No, I'm not blaming anyone. I'm just trying to make you understand.",
        "Clint: Well, yes, I would like to understand why you chose to lie to me and marry me and stay married while you're having sex with my brother.",

        "Clint: Yeah. And you expect me to believe that after you've been lying to me for months? Oh, dear God. Half the family knows about you and Bo.",
        "Nora: Oh, nobody knows, Clint.",
        "Clint: Oh, don't kid yourself, Nora! I'm the only one foolish enough to believe your lies! Love is blind, and I proved it! There I was calling you, telling you I love you, I miss you, I can't wait for you to get home. And all the while, you couldn't wait to get off the phone so you could get it on with my brother!",
        "Nora: It's not like that! That was not how it happened! And look at you! What are you doing here? You're standing there telling me about your doubts, and you didn't say anything to me?! My God, at least Bo and I tried to do the right thing! We didn't want to hurt you, so we tried to respect your feelings by picking a time to tell you! And what do you do? You go out and buy some two-bit whore and bring her into my house and bang her in my bed?! Jeez. God, Clint. What the hell is that?",
        "Clint: I never had any doubts. And I did not have sex with her. We just made it look that way so you could feel as stupid as I do.",

        "Blair: So you don't think any of this is your fault, that you're just an innocent bystander here? Well, let me tell you something, T\u00e9a. This is all of your doing because you chose to lie. You hid Dani from Ross, knowing how violent and crazy he could get. And then instead of sitting Todd down and telling him the truth and trusting whatever, that endless love you got going with him, you chose to lie to him knowing full well how he would react when he found out. And then you get on me and say that I put my love life before my children's happiness? Well, hell. You make me look like an amateur.",

You're why he had to take us hostage! You're why we had to run away from the cops! You're why Todd Manning shot him! It's all your fault! My father would still be alive if it weren't for you!",

I wouldn't do that to you. I loved you. It just was when Matthew was injured. It just seemed that all the old hurts went away.",
