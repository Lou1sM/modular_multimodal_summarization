        "Antonio and Jessica are making love, when the phone rings. Antonio hates to do it but he answers. Jessica goes to the window and sees Nash and Layla walking. They are smiling and familiar. They laugh and then hug. Antonio comes to Jessica at the window to tell that he has been called into work. Jessica ventures to the window again after Antonio leaves but the baby starts crying and so she tends to her. Jessica dresses the child and gets in the car to see the Christmas lights. She finds Nash walking and offers him a ride. He accepts and wonders what she is doing there. She tells that the baby wouldn't sleep. She asks about the date and learns that Nash and Layla hit it out of the park and will be seeing each other again. \"That's great,\" Jessica manages to say. Blair is wheeled off for her surgery. \"Is it mine or Truman's?\" Michael tells Todd that he has to do this surgery or Blair could possibly bleed out on the inside. He follows Blair's gurney out of the area. Bo starts walking to Todd again to cuff him. Todd tells the man that his family is on the line right now and he begs to be allowed to stay at the hospital. \"Blair's pregnant!\" Bo had no idea. Spencer is laying nearby on his stretcher and he overhears Todd talking to Bo. \"Blair's pregnant? Then we're gonna have a family,\" Spencer says. \"I got to tell Blair how happy I am that we are going to have a baby,\" Spencer smirks from his gurney. Todd's face turns lethal and it is a good thing that Bo is there to stand before him and stop him from taking the couple of steps over to the man to fix his wagon again. \"Dad! Dad!\" Starr shouts running in. \"Where's mom? Is she going to be alright?\" She looks up into her father's face frantic with worry. He isn't pleased to see Marty and her son there, but Bo explains that he left Starr with Marty when he got the emergency call and that there isn't anything to worry about. Starr overhears Spencer ranting about Blair having his baby and he turns to her father horrified that this could be true. Todd can't answer her. He doesn't know. Michael lets Todd go and see Blair but only for two minutes. Todd comes to Blair now. He touches her hand. \"We have to talk Todd. We have to talk about the baby,\" she tells him in a small voice. Starr is upset and so Cole sits with her and tells her that this might not be a bad thing. Maybe it will be something that brings your parents back together again. Todd goes in to see Blair before her surgery. She is weak but glad to see him. \"I have to talk to you. I did a DNA test. The baby is yours.\" Todd breathes a sigh of relief and Blair is wheeled away for surgery."

        "Marty: Starr, I just got off the phone with a nurse in the E.R.",
        "Starr: Okay, yeah?",

        "Marty: She's at the hospital, and they're assessing the situation right now.",
        "Marty: She fell off a -- a roof at a warehouse outside of town.",

        "Marty: They're just trying to figure out. No one really knows right now, okay? They're figuring it all out.",
        "Starr: She's all right, isn't she? Please.",
        "Marty: Your dad is with her, and they're taking her into surgery in just a few minutes, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay, no, I need to be there right now. You don't understand.",
        "Marty: Okay. Okay, sweetie, okay? I will take you. Look, I'm just going to pay the check. Could you just grab our coats, okay?",
        "Cole: It's all right. It's okay.",

        "Todd: Blair?",
        "Michael: We really need to get her into an O.R. Come on, go, guys.",
        "Todd: Michael, is she really pregnant?",
        "Michael: Listen, that's what she keeps saying, but I'm not going to know until I get the labs back. Now, if you love this woman, you will let me perform surgery, because she may just bleed out from the inside.",
        "Bo: No, Manning -- Manning --",
        "Todd: Bo, you got to let me go.",
        "Bo: You're under suspicion of attempted murder.",
        "Todd: Yeah, of a psychopath!",
        "Bo: Yeah, but that doesn't make you special. Most killers think that their victims had it coming.",
        "Todd: We're talking about my family here, Bo. Possibly my own child. If she's pregnant, I need to know who the father is.",
        "Spencer: Blair's pregnant? Then we're going to have a baby.",

        "[Layla laughs]",
        "Layla: Thanks for seeing me home.",
        "Nash: Well, it's like I said --",
        "Layla: Nothing better to do.",
        "Nash: I did not say that.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nash: I did tell Tyra Banks that I had better plans tonight and to quit calling me, but --",
        "Layla: Hmm. It was nice getting out.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Especially with a guy like you who isn't a jerk and doesn't make me feel like warmed-over garbage.",
        "Nash: Jones did that?",
        "Layla: No. He made me feel really good, actually. Special. But he's not good for me. And trashing him makes me stay away from him.",
        "Nash: Well, you must be really good at diets, then.",
        "Layla: Oh, it depends on what's for lunch.",
        "Nash: Huh. Well, uh -- huh -- flustered -- um -- you are a wonderful girl. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.",
        "Layla: Thank you. And if you were serious about hanging, I'm going to take you up on those wine lessons.",
        "Nash: It's a deal. If Jessica could see us now, she would freak out.",
        "Layla: Do you really think she wanted us to fall head over heels for each other?",
        "Nash: Is that what's happening? No, it's none of her business either way. Kind of annoying, though, huh? I mean, even if I did have a lot of fun tonight. What are the odds of that, huh?",
        "Layla: Still, she must really care about you, to go through all that trouble.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Or maybe she's trying to set me up because she feels guilty for not being Tess.",
        "Layla: You think she really does?",
        "Nash: Or maybe she feels guilty that she's living happily with Antonio while I'm supposed to be getting over Tess -- I don't know.",
        "Layla: Well, whatever it is, whatever her motives were, I'm glad I have a new friend.",
        "Nash: Me, too -- friend. So, whenever you're ready for that next wine lesson, give me a call. I'll give you a tour of the winery. Show you around.",
        "Layla: I'd love that. Except it'll have to be after Christmas. I'm going to visit my family.",
        "Nash: Okay. I'll call you.",
        "Layla: Give me your cell.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Layla: I'll put my number in it.",
        "Nash: Batteries are dead. Write it down.",
        "Layla: I have nothing to write it on.",
        "Nash: Write it on me.",
        "[Layla chuckles]",
        "Layla: Don't wash it till it's on your phone list.",
        "Nash: I will never wash it, okay?",

        "Adriana: I cannot believe that Dorian thinks she can get away with this, trying to infiltrate my company using some bogus investor!",
        "Rex: Well, when you think about it, it's classic Dorian.",
        "Adriana: Well, I'm not going to let her get away with this.",
        "Rex: So you're just going to turn her down?",
        "Adriana: I can't take the money! If I do, she'll own me, then.",
        "Rex: Yeah, but technically, isn't it your money that she's paying back?",
        "Adriana: What? You think I should take it?",
        "Rex: I know you're pissed, but Dorian said that she was just trying to fix what happened with your Aunt Betsy's money.",
        "Adriana: My money, from my Aunt Betsy, and what happened was Dorian stole it. She already offered to pay it back and I turned her down. What makes her think that I'll take her money now through some middleman?",
        "Rex: I guess she was hoping you wouldn't find out.",
        "Adriana: Well, she was wrong.",
        "[Adriana sighs]",
        "Layla: What's going on?",
        "Adriana: I just found out my mother's latest scheme.",
        "Layla: Oh, what did she do now?",
        "Adriana: You know that investor that came to you? Richard La Flower?",
        "Rex: Fleur.",
        "Adriana: He is working for my mother.",
        "Layla: So it's your mother who wants to back us?",
        "Adriana: Yes. Can you believe her?",
        "Layla: I can't believe you. Adriana, it's free money. That's just what we need to get this company going.",

        "Cristian: Pretty cold out there, huh?",
        "Evangeline: Oh, yeah. I'm going to need hot chocolate before we tackle Angel Square.",
        "Cristian: Two lattes, please.",
        "Evangeline: Thanks.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "Evangeline: You know, that scene you painted on the window at Logan's -- it's beautiful.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right.",
        "Evangeline: Excuse me. I'm not the only person who thinks this.",
        "Cristian: Thank you.",
        "Evangeline: Everybody said it. I'm listening to other people talk about it --",
        "Cristian: Thank you. I just don't think it's as good as what I used to do, that's all.",

        "Evangeline: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: So, how are you doing with this Truman stuff?",
        "Evangeline: I'm handling it. But honestly, Cristian, I feel like everywhere I go, I see that man out of the corner of my eye. You know?",
        "Cristian: And?",
        "Evangeline: I just hope that Todd isn't involved with Spencer's disappearance.",
        "Cristian: Well, I'm not a gambler, but I'd lay odds he's knee-deep in it.",
        "Evangeline: Todd deserves revenge. Spencer plotted his execution, he took his son from him, he won't tell him where he is. But I just still hope Todd doesn't do something stupid.",
        "Cristian: Oh, he will -- if he hasn't already.",

        "Todd: Son of a bitch --",
        "Bo: No, Manning, you're in enough trouble.",
        "Spencer: You got to arrest him, Commissioner. He kidnapped me, tortured me, and pushed me and Blair off the rooftop.",
        "Todd: That's all lies, Bo.",
        "Bo: All right, but it's enough to take you in for questioning. Come on, let's go. You can call your lawyer on the way.",
        "Starr: Dad? Dad! Where's Mom? Is she okay? Please say she's going to be okay.",

        "Evangeline: Thank you.",

        "Evangeline: Yes, I am.",
        "Cristian: Yes!",
        "Evangeline: But my mother wasn't very thrilled about it. So I sent Layla in my place. I had to bribe her, because she didn't want to go without me. I don't want my mother to be alone on Christmas, you know? But with everything that's going on here, I just -- I don't think I should go. And I think Layla will be happy when she gets there.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, and I think it's good for her to get out of town. This way, she won't have Vincent making the moves on her all through the holidays.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, she is so over Vincent.",
        "Cristian: Is she?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I talked to her earlier, and she was going out on a date.",

        "Cristian: Nash?",
        "Evangeline: What, he's not good?",
        "Cristian: No, no. I actually suggested Layla to Nash. I thought it was a good idea.",
        "Evangeline: Okay, cupid, I don't know if that's such a good idea. Isn't he, like, on the rebound from something?",
        "Cristian: And Layla isn't?",
        "Evangeline: Well, I guess you're right. As far as I'm concerned, anybody is better than -- for her -- than Vincent Jones.",
        "Vincent: My, my, my. You wouldn't be talking about that damn Vincent Jones, now, would you?",

        "Jessica: Hey, Bree, look at the pretty lights. Huh. It's not like those lights are going to calm you down and make you go to sleep, huh? One thing's for sure, though. When you get bigger, your mom is going to take you all around Llanview to show you how pretty it is. We're going to go to concerts in the park. We're going to hike around Llantano Mountain. We're going to go swimming in the quarry -- all the things that I did when I was a little girl. You see that, over there? That's abuela Carlotta's diner. And there -- that's Nash.",

        "Jessica: Hey! You want a ride?",
        "Nash: Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, and Bree.",
        "Nash: What are you doing out? I thought Antonio took you home to bed.",
        "Jessica: He did. But then Bree started crying and fussing. And you know, the only way to get a baby to calm down is to take her for a drive. And she's lucky that Jamie was staying at her grandpa R.J.'s, so I could do it.",
        "Nash: Huh. Hey -- what are you doing, keeping your mommy out late, huh? Huh? Hey.",
        "Jessica: Well, what are doing out so late, wandering the streets?",

        "Todd: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Bo: I mean, look at you right now. You haven't learned a thing. Blair -- she's in critical condition. And what did you do? You bought a one-way ticket right back to the holding cell.",
        "Todd: Listen, Truman is lying. He's lying. I wouldn't push Blair. She fell.",
        "Bo: I want to know exactly why the three of you were up on that roof in the first place.",
        "Todd: I got a -- I got an anonymous tip that Spencer was hiding there, so I went over to check it out, and I found him there holed up. And I chased him up to the roof, and we had it out up there, and -- he got the advantage, and he got me to the edge. He was trying to push me off, and then Blair showed up, and I think she must have -- she must have hit him with something. But she got in the middle of it all, and -- and the next thing I know, she and Truman are going off the roof. That all I know. He pulled her off. He dragged her off the roof.",
        "Bo: You saw Blair and Truman go off that roof together?",
        "Todd: Yeah, yes, I did, and then I ran down to -- to the ground and I called 911.",
        "Bo: And were you still there when the paramedics got to the scene?",
        "Todd: Yeah, of course. But I'm not responsible for their falling. So you can't -- you can't arrest me for anything. You got nothing on me.",
        "Bo: But you knew Truman fell from the roof?",
        "Todd: Yes, but I didn't push him.",
        "Bo: Yeah. But we found him laying there on the ground and bleeding to death, and that was after Blair went to the hospital. Now, did you tell the paramedics that he was there? Look, if you didn't, that's attempted murder.",

        "Vincent: Well, he wanted to get some things straight with me. You know, he wanted to talk to me man to man.",

        "Adriana: Not from Dorian, all right? Trust me on this one. There is a high price to pay for her generosity, and you know what? This is the perfect example. I wouldn't let her in, so she's trying to force her way in like she always does.",
        "Layla: Rex, you talked to Adriana's mother. You think this is what she's doing?",
        "Rex: Don't know. It's really hard for me to make a call on this one.",
