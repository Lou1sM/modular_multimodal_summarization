        "Dorian: Aha, where are your holiday outfits for our Cramer women holiday extravaganza? Get going. Come on.",
        "Starr: Well, where's Cassie? Is she going to come?",
        "Dorian: No, she can't make it.",
        "Blair: Oh, and guess what -- Kelly's not going to be here, either.",
        "Dorian: Well, all the way from London -- she can't make it, but, oh, your grandma -- Addie is going to be here just, well, anytime now.",
        "Starr: Adriana going to come?",
        "Dorian: Yes, she's going to be here.",
        "Blair: Great.",
        "Dorian: Um, indeed. So, why don't you all go and get dressed? Right now.",
        "Starr: Sounds good.",
        "Langston: What was that all about?",
        "Starr: Fasten your seat belts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Yes! How did you guys know I wanted these?",
        "Layla: Um, maybe the open catalog with the circle around it.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Vincent: And now you can give back mine, please. Thank you.",
        "Sarah: Oh -- okay. There you are.",
        "Vincent: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Sarah: And I have something for you guys.",
        "Layla: Yeah? Okay.",
        "Sarah: There you go.",
        "Layla: Oh, my God. Look, Vincent, look at these seats.",
        "Vincent: Ah, where'd you find these? You know I've been calling all around town for them?",
        "Sarah: Guess you just got to have the right connections.",
        "Layla: Oh, my -- girl, thank you. Thank you.",
        "Sarah: You, too. You, too. Both of you. So, you guys are going to be in Maryland for the holidays?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. What are you doing?",
        "Sarah: Probably just hanging out with family -- unless something better comes up.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sarah: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mom met some guy when she was in Paris.",
        "Jessica: Well -- I can't believe she wouldn't tell me about it.",
        "Natalie: She didn't tell me, either -- I had to get it out of her.",
        "Nash: Oh, my God, is he French?",
        "Natalie: Well, actually, I don't know -- Mom's not talking. I don't even know his name. All I know is there is somebody and she's obviously hot enough for him that she went back to Paris to see him.",
        "Nash: So my mother-in-law is not going to be here for Christmas?",
        "Natalie: Well, this whole family is going crazy. You know, Mom's acting like a teenager, Dad's having drama with Dorian, and you two are acting like you have some sort of lobotomy.",
        "Jessica: Ah -- that's what's really bothering you -- it's Jared.",
        "Natalie: What I don't get is how it's not bothering you.",
        "Jessica: I just don't see a point in fighting about it anymore.",
        "Natalie: And you're really onboard with this?",
        "Nash: Yeah. Sure. Listen, I'm, um -- I'm going to go finish my Christmas shopping. I'm going to leave you two here to hash it out. Hmm. Bye.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Look, I know that dealing with this Jared thing is harder for you than it is for me, but you have to find a way to move past it.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I already have.",
        "Jessica: Really? How?",
        "Natalie: I slept with John last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, hey, Jared. I want you to meet Cole Thornhart.",
        "Jared: Oh, Cole. Jared Ba-- Jared Buchanan. I'm still getting used to that.",
        "Cole: Yeah, Miss Hanen filled me in.",
        "Nora: \"Miss\"? What? \"Nora,\" please. \"Nora,\" okay? Cole's going to be living with us now.",
        "Jared: Ah. I heard about your mom. I'm sorry.",
        "Cole: Thank you.",
        "Nora: So I'm going to have -- get Nigel to take your stuff up to your old room, all right? And you just make yourself at home.",
        "Cole: Hey, I appreciate everything you're trying to do for me, but this is never going to be my home.",

        "Gigi: Sorry I'm late, Moe. If you had a heart, you'd understand, but you don't, so you won't. Did Noelle clean the aprons like she was supposed to?",
        "Rex: Morasco?",
        "Gigi: Balsom? How did you find me here?",
        "Rex: I wasn't even looking. What are you doing in Paris, Texas?",
        "Gigi: I live here now.",
        "Rex: Man, talk about a coincidence. It's good to see you.",
        "Gigi: Don't.",
        "Rex: Why not?",
        "Gigi: You have a lot of nerve asking that after what you did to me.",

        "Charlie: Yeah, I just don't seem to have any luck with these things.",
        "Viki: Well, don't worry about it. I mean, we can just talk.",
        "Viki: How was your meeting?",
        "Charlie: It was good to be back with my friends.",
        "Viki: So what happens now?",
        "Charlie: 90 and 90.",
        "Viki: What is that?",
        "Charlie: That's 90 meetings in 90 days.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. You think you can deal with a guy who's newly back on the wagon?",
        "Viki: Oh, I think the chances are excellent.",
        "Charlie: I'm very glad you came back. You know, when I got back to Paris, the first thing I did was run straight over to the Bon-Jour Cafe looking for you.",
        "Viki: And I wasn't there. That's not why you started drinking, though, is it?",
        "Charlie: Oh, no, no, no, no, I did that all on my own, but I must admit that when I was out looking for my son, I never once stopped thinking about you.",
        "Charlie: Oh, maybe if I talked to the management I can get a speaker that works here.",
        "Viki: Charlie, I missed you, a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, I'm sorry, didn't mean any disrespect.",
        "Nora: Cole, it's okay. Please, I completely understand. You don't want to be here, you want to be at home, with your mom.",
        "Matthew: Cole, hey. I heard you were moving back in. That's awesome. I mean, it's not -- I -- it'd be better if you weren't. I mean, it's --",
        "Cole: Matthew --",
        "Matthew: It's not bad --",
        "Cole: Matthew, Matthew --",
        "Matthew: It's cool --",
        "Cole: Matthew, man -- it's cool, man. Don't worry about it. I know what you mean. All right?",
        "Nora: So, did you and your dad finish all your last-minute Christmas shopping?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, thank God. He was getting a bit cranky.",
        "Nora: Well, I can believe that. You've been gone a long time.",
        "Matthew: We went to see Lindsay, too.",
        "Nora: Your father took you to St. Ann's?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I asked him to take me. R.J. was there, too. She's better now.",
        "Nora: Lindsay's better now?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. A lot.",
        "Nora: Hmm, really? Cole, could you -- are you going to be okay? I just need to talk to Matthew for a minute, alone.",
        "Cole: Yeah, sure.",
        "Nora: Okay. Come here, sweetheart. Come on.",
        "Cole: Whew.",
        "Jared: Just so you know, if there's anything I can do --",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah? Like what? Bring back my mom, my dad? That's all I want, and that's not going to happen. Do you know how it feels?",
        "Jared: Actually, yeah, I do.",

        "Dorian: Thank you.",

        "[Dorian gasps]",
        "Adriana: Don't get the wrong idea. I'm still not happy about the way you feel about Rex, but it's Christmas and you're my family, so --",
        "Dorian: You look gorgeous. I love that dress! Honey, thank you for coming. It wouldn't be Christmas without you. Oh.",
        "Blair: Ahem!",
        "Dorian: Blair, darling -- well, as you can see, Adriana's here. I -- I'm sure that the two of you will get along well in the spirit of the holidays, and if not, will you fake it for my sake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I hope this thing doesn't last too long. I want to call Cole. He probably really misses me. He just moved into Nora's house.",
        "Langston: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Starr: Hi. Merry Christmas, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Merry Christmas, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: Where's Rex?",
        "Adriana: Oh, he's on assignment.",
        "Langston: What? Is there something wrong with what I'm wearing?",
        "Dorian: I'm just not sure the whole skull motif thing is appropriate for Christmas.",
        "Langston: Well, you know, I was going to wear my Mrs. Santa costume, but the cleaners ruined my muff.",
        "Dorian: Luckily, I happen to have this, which I bought for you at the last minute. Why don't you take it to your room, open it up. I promise, you'll be inspired.",
        "Langston: Thank you, Dorian.",
        "Starr: This should be interesting.",
        "Blair: Good luck.",
        "Dorian: So, is Rex still out of town?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. I was just telling Starr that he's on the case.",
        "Dorian: Great. Such a shame he couldn't, you know, take time out and join us all for the Christmas holiday.",
        "Adriana: Well, he can't exactly fly back from Texas just for the evening.",
        "Blair: Texas? What the hell is Rex doing in Texas?",

        "[\"Greensleeves\" plays]",
        "Rex: Gigi, I know it's been a long time since Michigan, but I don't remember anything bad between us.",
        "Gigi: Maybe because you didn't care.",
        "Rex: Oh, come on. We went together through most of senior year.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and then you just took off. No goodbye, no nothing. I waited for you to call.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Gigi: And when you didn't, I went to your Aunt Corinne's house. She's the one who told me you left town.",
        "Rex: She didn't say why?",
        "Gigi: She was never crazy about me, Rex.",
        "Rex: Okay, it -- it was an emergency. I had to go to Pennsylvania to find my sister.",
        "Gigi: You couldn't call me just to let me know you were still sucking air?",
        "Rex: I don't know what to say.",
        "Gigi: How about \"I'm sorry\"?",
        "Rex: I thought that I'd be coming back. And then things got complicated, and I didn't, so --",
        "Gigi: You were my boyfriend, Rex. Didn't I mean anything to you?",
        "Rex: You might not believe this now, but you meant a lot to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, you're trying to get over Jared by sleeping with John?",
        "Natalie: It was a one-night thing. You know, two friends just trying to help each other out.",
        "Jessica: No, no, friends don't do that. Friends take each other out for coffee, they -- they cry on each other's shoulders, they don't hop into bed and have sex with one another.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, they do -- sometimes. It -- it's just -- you know, when they need to feel close to someone.",
        "Jessica: Okay, it didn't work. It might have worked for maybe one night, but it's still there, Natalie, I can see it.",
        "Natalie: Okay, what do you want me to do, flip a switch and just turn off my feelings?",
        "Jessica: No, but I don't think sleeping with John is a very good solution, either.",
        "Natalie: If you're going to lecture me about sleeping around --",
        "Jessica: No, I'm not ting to lecture you, and after what Tess did, you're practically a saint, but John is still trying to get over Marty. I don't want to see you get hurt more than you already are.",
        "Natalie: You really think that I'm that big of a loser?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Really good to see you.",
        "Cristian: Good to see you, too. Listen, I was wondering if I could talk to Layla.",
        "Sarah: Oh. Yeah, sure. She's right here. Come on in.",
        "Cristian: Thanks. Hey, how are you doing?",
        "Layla: Hey, Cristian.",
        "Vincent: Vega, how's it going?",
        "Cristian: Good. You got a minute?",
        "Layla: Yeah. What do you want to see me about?",
        "Cristian: Well, can we go somewhere else to talk?",
        "Sarah: Oh, hey -- huh. Don't mind me. I'll -- I'll just use the present that Layla and Vincent gave me.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Sarah: They're -- they're noise-canceling, so I won't hear anything you guys say about me.",
        "Layla: Okay, what's going on?",
        "Cristian: I want to see Evangeline.",
        "Layla: I'll see what I can do, Cristian.",
        "Vincent: Well, we're on our way to Maryland now. Layla can make her case in person. I'll back her up.",
        "Cristian: I got a better idea. I'll state the case myself.",
        "Layla: Cristian, you're not thinking about going with --",
        "Cristian: I'm going with you guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm glad I meant something to you, because --",
        "[\"O Holy Night\" plays]",
        "Gigi: Well, I never forgot you, Rex.",
        "Rex: Hey, I'm the guy you made climb the flagpole at school to steal the banner from Lakewood High.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. And then when I got it home, I realized I couldn't hang it in my room or I'd get busted.",
        "Rex: I helped you set off those stink bombs right before finals.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and we put lab specimens in old lady Richter's purse.",
        "Rex: We were a great team, huh? Look, Gigi, I really am sorry that I was such an ass. But this thing with my sister -- it was really major. And by the time I got a chance to finally call you, it had been so long, I figured a great girl like you had moved on to somebody new. It's not like you were that in to me anyway, right? Or were you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I am really sorry, Viki, again.",
        "Viki: It's not your fault the speaker doesn't work.",
        "Charlie: No, now, you know darn well I'm not talking about the speaker.",
        "Viki: Charlie, we all, you know, stumble now and then.",
        "Charlie: Now, you've spent so much time picking up the pieces and putting me back together again, I never had a chance to ask you -- why did you decide to go home so suddenly?",
        "Viki: A friend of mine and a close friend of my daughter's was killed.",
        "Charlie: Oh, my God. I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Oh, God, she was so young, and she left behind a teenage son.",
        "Charlie: Oh, jeez. No kid that age should ever have to fend for themselves.",
        "Viki: Charlie, you're trying to make amends.",
        "Charlie: Hey, I thought we were talking about you.",
        "Viki: Okay. And I guess I felt kind of guilty. You know, I -- I'd been taking all this time for myself here, and there were people at home who needed me.",
        "Charlie: Which would make you feel better, if I just agree with you, or if I try to explain to you why you have no reason to feel guilty?",
        "Viki: I don't know.",
        "Charlie: Okay, first of all, they're not kids anymore, all right?",
        "Viki: Right.",
        "Charlie: And knowing you, you're most probably on the phone to them every day.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but it's not the same thing, is it?",
        "Charlie: Okay. Then what are you doing here?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Viki: One of my daughters thinks that it's -- well, that it's because of a man.",
        "Charlie: Ah. Anybody I know?",
        "Viki: Maybe. Anyway, she's the daughter that I worry about the most, you know. You see -- um -- I had -- problems, big problems that prevented me from being a part of her life until she was practically grown.",
        "Charlie: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: Yeah, me, too. And I keep trying to make it up to her.",
        "Charlie: Is she at least accepting that?",
        "Viki: Oh, she is now, yeah.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Viki: She's -- she's remarkable. And she keeps telling me not to worry and not to feel guilty, but -- I mean, I do worry about her, and right now, she's falling for some guy who just broke her heart.",
        "Charlie: Ah. [As a mobster] You want I should take care of the louse?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Charlie: You just give me the word.",

        "Jared: I grew up without a dad.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I heard about you turning out to be Asa Buchanan's son. Well, what about your mom?",
        "Jared: Huh. We were close. I was -- I was pretty torn up when she died.",
        "Cole: So you know --",
        "Jared: Yeah, I know. At least you have good people looking out for you.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's not the same.",
        "Jared: No, it's not, you're right. There is nothing like your real family. And you hold it against everyone else who still has theirs. At least, I did.",
        "Cole: Hey, look, I'm sorry for going off on you.",
        "Jared: Hey, don't worry about it. If you can't dump on a stranger, who can you? I mean, we're going to be living here, right? So, dump away, anytime you need to.",

        "Nora: So, you say Lindsay's back to her old self?",
        "Matthew: Pretty much.",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Matthew: Dad got her laughing about stuff.",
        "Nora: Does he? That's nice. Well, I'm -- I'm glad that Lindsay's feeling better.",
        "Matthew: So you're okay that I went to go see her? See, I only went because I wanted to give her that DVD. that I burned of this tape that Jen made, and I gave it to Lindsay for Christmas.",
        "Nora: Oh, God, you're a good kid. Does anyone ever tell you that? You're a good kid.",
        "Matthew: Huh. Does that mean I can have that video game that I've been asking for for Christmas?",
        "Nora: That one? No, you're not that good, kid. And don't push your luck.",
        "Matthew: I'm going to go get the gifts I got and put them under the tree.",
        "Nora: Yeah, put them in the library.",
        "Nora: Baxter? Hanen. I need you to pull the Spencer Truman murder case file, and I want it by tomorrow morning. Yes, I realize it's almost Christmas, but I have a feeling by the new year, Spencer Truman's murderer is going to finally be standing trial.",

        "Blair: And what kind of case would Rex be working on in Texas, Adriana?",
        "Adriana: I believe that's Rex's business, not yours.",
        "Blair: No, you -- you made it my business when you just mentioned it, so I'm just interested in --",

        "Langston: You like it?",
        "Dorian: Yes, I do. Don't you think so? She just looks -- it's just so Audrey Hepburn. I love it! I love it! Oh, well, now, if we can just do something about her hair.",

        "Starr: Not a day over 38.",
        "Blair: So, Adriana, does Rex happen to be in Paris, Texas? Hmm?",
        "Adriana: Yes, and since you're going to harass me till you know everything, he's looking for Marcie.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: I can't wait for Addie to get here. Let me show you what I got her. Um -- a bed jacket, which is so practical. Pink because we know she loves pink. A new --",
