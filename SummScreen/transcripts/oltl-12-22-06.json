Merry Christmas.", "Marcie: Here you go.", "Natalie: Merry Christmas.", "Michael: Merry Christmas.", "Natalie: Look at that adorable baby Santa. You are so cute!", "Marcie: Well, yeah. We had to park the reindeer up on the rooftop. You know, I don't know -- the hospital has a silly rule about no animals in the hospital.", "Natalie: Oh.", "Michael: I don't know why they let me in.", "Michael: So, look at you. Sitting up. About time, lazy bones.", "John: Yeah, well, I couldn't open my presents lying down, could I?", "Michael: You know, john was always the first one down at the Christmas tree. Every morning, he opened all his gifts before anybody woke up.", "John: That's because you opened yours the night before.", "Michael: That's -- that's not true. That is not true. It's not true.", "Marcie: Oh.", "Michael: It's not true.", "Marcie: I doubt that, because someone opened his presents last night. I wonder who was that, hmm?", "Michael: I don't know.", "Natalie: Well --", "Michael: Maybe it was Santa.", "Natalie: That's ok, because we got lots more.", "Marcie: Oh, wow. You didn't have to.", "Natalie: I didn't. John -- john did it.", "Marcie: How?", "Natalie: Whoops.", "John: Oh, well, I -- I had some help.", "Natalie: Yes, well, he made the list, and I checked it twice.", "Michael: You better tell me that he did not make you buy your own gift.", "Marcie: No, she didn't have to. We already know what john bought her. His mom's engagement ring. Let's see it.", "Natalie: Ahem.", "Michael: Honey, I think you might have jumped the gun a little bit here on this one.", "Marcie: I'm -- I'm sorry.", "John: It's ok.", "Marcie: I'm sorry, Natalie --", "Natalie: No --", "Marcie: I just -- with Christmas and --", "Natalie: No, it's ok. My present from john was seeing him out of bed. And the fact that he's been a good boy for Santa and hasn't run out of this hospital just yet.", "Marcie: Oh, you know what? I think he wet his diaper.", "Michael: Yep, I think that Santa has given us a little early present.", "Marcie: Oh, yeah. Well, that's really good. Just what I wanted for Christmas.", "Michael: I'll change him.", "Marcie: No, no, no, no. Really -- I will. You might need to take over the elf responsibilities.", "Michael: Ok.", "Marcie: Ok. Come on, baby.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "John: I'm confused. I thought you were supposed to wear the Santa suit.", "Michael: Yeah, well, it didn't fit.", "John: Look, thanks for coming down anyway.", "Michael: Yeah, well, you know, I was going to spend my Christmas with a bunch of complete strangers, but, you know, I figured I'd throw you a bone.", "John: Oh, well, thanks for the sacrifice. I wish mom was here.", "Michael: Yeah. You know, I -- I talked to her. She called from the cruise. She's more calypso. Said that she'll come and see us when she gets back, maybe spend some time.", "John: Yeah, I know she called. Hey, you know, I -- I don't want to keep you from your mom and the rest of your family.", "Natalie: Well, actually, Michael and I haven't given you your present yet.", "John: What? You -- you two collaborated?", "Natalie: Mm-hmm.", "Michael: Yeah.", "Natalie: A little bit.", "John: A little bit?", "Michael: Just a little.", "John: Is it a one-way ticket out of here?", "Natalie: Almost.", "Michael: Ok. Well, what I have arranged is that you are going to be moved to Llanview hospital for your recovery, where I can keep a better eye on you.", "John: Yeah?", "Michael: Yeah.", "Natalie: Hey, don't smile too much, babe. People might think you might be happy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Spencer: How am I doing, Blair?", "Paige: You'll live -- unfortunately. Thanks. I'll take it from here.", "Nurse: For the record, my name's not Blair.", "Paige: Are you still trying to convince people that you're crazy?", "Spencer: Are you still trying to convince people you're a doctor? Listen, you're not qualified, nor are you authorized to review my chart. Get lost.", "Paige: Actually, I am authorized. The hospital reinstated me. I got my license back. I'm practicing medicine again.", "Spencer: Oh, good. Then you'll be the first one I name in my lawsuit against Llanview hospital. They really wouldn't be stupid enough to assign my ex-wife my case, would they?", "Paige: Oh, no, that would be unethical for anybody except you.", "Spencer: You're in no position to talk ethics with me. Why are you here, Paige? Did you just come to harass me to death?", "Paige: Well, this is my Christmas present to myself. I just love seeing you chained to the bed, helpless, unable to hurt anybody.", "Bo: A lot of people would like to see that. I ought to bring a camera down here and get a picture. How'd you get past the guard?", "Paige: Uh -- doctor's privileges.", "Spencer: What, you posted a guard outside my door? I'm flattered. What's the matter? You think I'd try to escape?", "Bo: No, no, no. See, it's not so much about people trying to get out of here, it's people trying to get in here, because there's a lot of people who would like to see you dead.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Viki: Oh, Clint --", "Clint: Yeah -- Ahem. It's for Natalie and Bree, Jamie, and Zane.", "Viki: That's lovely. Thank you.", "Clint: You're welcome.", "Viki: Let me add them. Hang on a minute.", "Clint: Here, let me do it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jessica: Oh, no. Is it that time?", "Antonio: Yes. I have one loose end I have to tie up. And then we'll go to my mom's.", "Jessica: Ok. Well, you be fast.", "Antonio: I will. I love you.", "Jessica: I love you, too.", "Antonio: Ok. Merry Christmas, everyone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Roxy: Bye.", "Clint: Bye.", "Renee: Oh, Jessica, look. I found another one for you.", "Jessica: Hmm. Who's it from?", "Renee: I don't know. There wasn't any name on the card.", "Roxy: Looks like you got a secret admirer.", "Renee: Oh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nash: Hey, look, baby girl, there's one more present. One more present. Over here. Look. It's got a big bow on it. Let's see what it is. Let's see what it is. It's -- oh, you're not going to believe this. A rocker. It's a motorcycle jacket. It's from your mummy Tess. She told me to tell you merry Christmas. And she would be here if she could.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dorian: I love presents. Though, of course, the best gift of all would be having Blair here and healthy. But having you here for Christmas -- well, that's right at the top of my list.", "Adriana: I wish Blair were here, too.", "Dorian: We'll have a second Christmas when she's out of the hospital. Well, I've got a present for you.", "Adriana: Wait, Dorian. I don't have a gift for you. I have this.", "Dorian: What is it?", "Adriana: It's a check from Richard Lefleur.", "Dorian: Who's that?", "Adriana: The secret investor in my lingerie company. But then, you already knew that.", "Rex: Hey, I told you I'd do what's best for Adriana.", "Dorian: I'm not going to take it.", "Adriana: Fine.", "Dorian: No, stop it! That's a cashier's check. It's as good as cash.", "Adriana: Well, now it's $50,000 of torn paper.", "Dorian: Well -- I'm --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carlotta: Merry Christmas.", "Evangeline: Merry Christmas.", "Dorian: Feliz navidad.", "Adriana: Merry Christmas, you guys. I'm sorry that Rex and I can't stay. I wish you were my real mother.", "Rex: Merry Christmas, everyone.", "Evangeline: Uh -- maybe we should go.", "Dorian: No, please, stay. I need your help winning Adriana back.", "Dorian: Cristian, I know how close you and Adriana are. Couldn't you please talk to her? Convince her that she does need her mother?", "Cristian: Um -- I'm really sorry, Dorian, but I'm not good with that kind of stuff. Besides, you know Adriana. She's stubborn.", "Evangeline: Dorian, my mom and I -- we have our ups and downs, too. But in time, we forget why we were even mad at each other, you know? And we make up. I -- I think she'll come around.", "Dorian: Thank you, but I did some pretty terrible things, and I don't think Adriana's going to forget.", "Carlotta: Dorian, Adriana has a good heart. I think she will.", "Dorian: Um -- I'm sure that you've got a lot of people you need to see this morning. Hmm?", "Carlotta: We're happy to stay.", "Cristian: Mami, maybe Dorian's right. Antonio's coming by and we don't want to be late. Merry Christmas.", "Evangeline: Merry Christmas.", "Dorian: Thank you.", "Cristian: Gracias.", "Carlotta: Are you sure?", "Dorian: Yes. Yes, I -- I've got a lot of people coming over today.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Renee: Oh. Must be from Antonio. It's so beautiful.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Roxy: Boy, those Vega boys really know the gift of giving.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nash: You know, a friend of mine in high school -- his mom had this locket around her neck with a picture of him in it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: Hey!", "Viki: Merry Christmas, sweetheart!", "Natalie: Merry Christmas. It looks like you guys have been having a lot of fun.", "Viki: Well, better now that you're here. How's john?", "Natalie: He's doing wonderful. He got out of bed today for the first time.", "Viki: Oh, my god, that's fantastic.", "Natalie: I know.", "Viki: Yay!", "Natalie: I hope you guys don't mind. I'm going to only stay for a little while. I want to go back to him.", "Viki: Absolutely, absolutely.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Roxy: Merry Christmas, Nattie.", "Natalie: Hey! Merry Christmas. Oh, it's so nice that mom invited you.", "Roxy: Honey, you invited me. Or maybe you forgot because everything going on with that cutie-patootie in the hospital.", "Natalie: Oh. Well, you know what? I'm so glad that you're here.", "Roxy: Well, it wouldn't be Christmas without my baby girl.", "Natalie: Thank you, Roxy. I feel the same way about you.", "Roxy: Oh!", "Natalie: Oh, well, let me go say hi to Jess.", "Roxy: Ok.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: Hey, merry Christmas.", "Jessica: Hi! Same to you. Oh, my goodness. How's john?", "Natalie: He's good. Oh, that is beautiful.", "Jessica: Yeah. What did Santa bring you? No ring?", "Natalie: Uh -- well, we -- we talked about it.", "Jessica: And?", "Natalie: You know, while he's in the hospital, john just doesn't feel that that's a place to propose.", "Jessica: Natalie, he could propose to you in a dumpster and you'd be thrilled.", "Natalie: Busted. But I get -- I get how he feels.", "Jessica: Well, then explain it to me.", "Natalie: He's just got more important things on his mind right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michael: Here you go. Let me get you some water. You got to be parched, bro.", "John: I heard you assisted in tremens' surgery.", "Michael: Yeah. Yeah, I did. There wasn't anybody else in the hospital that had the proper training.", "John: I know. You don't have to explain to me, mike.", "Michael: I got to tell you, Johnny, there were a couple of moments there, you know, where I really considered making a little mistake.", "John: I'm glad he didn't die that way.", "Michael: You what? Why?", "John: You know, that kind of death would be too easy for him. I'm kind of imagining something a little more painful.", "Michael: Yeah? Well, something painful isn't going to happen if he can convince the judge that he's a freak.", "John: Mike, sooner or later, he has to be released from that hospital. And I'll be there to put an end to this once and for all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Spencer: Well, kind of silly, isn't it? I mean, what good does it do to post a guard outside my door when the two people that hate me the most are standing here right in front of me, even though I didn't do anything to either one of you.", "Paige: You know, he really must be insane, because he's in complete denial.", "Spencer: I'm not insane.", "Bo: No, you're preaching to the converted right now, Truman.", "Paige: And despite your efforts to destroy us, we are still standing. Bo and I haven't lost a thing.", "Bo: Certainly not each other.", "Spencer: I can't think of two people who deserve each other more.", "Paige: Merry Christmas, Spencer.", "Bo: Ho, ho, ho.", "Paige: Hmm.", "Spencer: Oh -- don't worry, mama, I'm not dead, and I'm not in prison. This is only a temporary situation. And I will get out of this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Clint: Are you having a good Christmas, Dorian?", "Dorian: Wonderful. I thought you might like to stop by later for some Christmas cheer.", "Clint: Oh, well, I appreciate that but I am spending the day with my family.", "Dorian: Of course, as I'll be with mine. Oh. It's going to be a madhouse.", "Clint: All right, I'll call you later.", "Viki: How are things between you and Dorian?", "Clint: Oh -- I don't know how, but we have managed to forge some sort of friendship. It's just that I still find it difficult to get past what she did to Adriana.", "Viki: Oh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: Hey, merry Christmas.", "Rex: Thanks for inviting us.", "Natalie: Mm-hmm. Merry Christmas.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Adriana: Merry Christmas.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: Merry Christmas. Hi!", "Paige: Merry Christmas.", "Bo: Hi, Nat.", "Natalie: Merry Christmas.", "Bo: Hey.", "Natalie: Merry Christmas.", "Bo: You, too.", "Natalie: I hope you don't mind if I hug and run, but I just want to get back to see john.", "Bo: Hey, tell him we said merry Christmas.", "Natalie: I will. But you'll be able to tell him yourself tomorrow, because he's coming to Llanview hospital.", "Bo: Oh.", "Paige: Great.", "Natalie: Yeah. All right, I'll see you guys later.", "Bo: Ok.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Viki: That's lovely.", "Jessica: I know.", "Viki: It's not from Antonio, is it?", "Jessica: How'd you guess?", "Viki: Your reaction would have been a little different when you opened it.", "Jessica: It's from Nash.", "Viki: It's kind of personal.", "Jessica: Yeah, I know. That's what worries me.", "Viki: Well, darling, you're not a mind reader, so you can't possibly know what it means to him to have given this to you. You can only know what it means to you. You'll grow into it, I promise. You know what? You are looking more and more like your mummy every day, both Jessica and Tess. She's turning into a great mom. Yes, she is. She is beautiful and charming and funny and married to Antonio. Hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Antonio: Officers -- anything new to report?", "Talia: Nope, it's all quiet.", "Antonio: I'm sorry I made you give up Christmas. But if Blair Cramer's awake, I'd like to see if she can remember anything about falling off that warehouse roof. And I got a feeling she'd rather talk to a woman.", "Talia: No, it's not a problem. Happy to help.", "Antonio: Great. Follow me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: Hey there.", "Officer: The commish didn't put you on Truman's guest list, Natalie.", "Natalie: Nah, it must have been an overlook. You want to give him a call?", "Officer: It's ok. Go on in.", "Natalie: Thank you. Merry Christmas.", "Spencer: Well, well, well. To what do I owe the pleasure, dear?", "Natalie: I am here to give john his Christmas present.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michael: So, Johnny, you're going to put an end to it once and for all, huh? How you planning on doing that?", "John: You worried I'm going to kill him?", "Michael: Yeah.", "John: You know, mike, I've -- I've blurred the line a few times, but I've never completely crossed it. I don't plan on changing that now.", "Michael: Really? So, what is this plan of yours?", "John: I just want to get back to work, you know. And for his own sake, hopefully Truman's found guilty and put in prison.", "Marcie: But he's not going to get the death penalty, is he?", "Michael: Listen, honey, I understand that you don't agree with it.", "Marcie: Well, it's not just that. I mean, if Spencer is executed, then Todd will never find out what happened to his son.", "Michael: Oh, I wouldn't worry too much for Todd manning, ok? With or without spencer's help, he's going to find out who his kid is.", "Marcie: Yeah, but hopefully Todd won't go to jail instead of Spencer.", "John: You seem to have a lot of concern for manning.", "Marcie: No, I -- I feel sorry for him. You know, I -- I can't imagine what it must be like to be separated from your child, not to know where he is, if he's in trouble or -- it -- it's just a lot.", "John: I sympathize to a point. But if he took the law into his own hands, I wouldn't have a problem putting him in jail.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Spencer: Let me guess -- Ahem. I know what you're thinking -- you're thinking that if you kill me, that you can win over Johnny boy's heart, right?", "Natalie: You think I want to kill you?", "Spencer: Doesn't everybody?", "Natalie: Hmm.", "Spencer: You got to admit -- make an awfully nice Christmas present for john.", "Natalie: Well, john would not be too sad to see you dead. But what john wants is to see you punished for his father's murder.", "Spencer: Oh, here we go again.", "Natalie: And since he can't be here himself, I've decided to come by and make sure you're as bad off as I heard you were.", "Spencer: Well, as long as it makes sense to you, Natalie. The points is, I really won't be here that long.", "Natalie: No. No, you won't. You'll be back at Wingdale. And as soon as the shrinks figure out that you're faking insanity, you'll go right back to trial.", "Spencer: I'm as sane as you are, Natalie, if not more so. The difference is, I'm not deluding myself with who killed your boyfriend's daddy.", "Natalie: Really? So are you admitting that you did it? Well, it's about time, Spencer. Can't wait to tell john.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cristian: Merry Christmas.", "Evangeline: Merry Christmas.", "Cristian: All right. You know I'm not that great with speeches. But this -- this past year turned out to be pretty incredible.", "Evangeline: In spite of your hand and -- and losing the big fight?", "Cristian: Well, you got me through it. Your love made me strong. And I wanted to get you something that showed you just how much I love you. Something really, really special.", "Evangeline: Oh. Cristian, you know, I love you, but -- but I think this is really -- we haven't really talked about this, and I -- I really think maybe this is too soon.", "Cristian: Hold on a second. Hold on a second.", "Evangeline: Cristian --", "Cristian: Just open the box. Open the box.", "Evangeline: Oh, Cristian -- oh -- I love it.", "Cristian: You thought it was a ring, though.", "Evangeline: Well, Nora -- she -- she was -- she said to me yesterday that -- that Christmas is official proposal day, so I -- so --", "Cristian: Is it?", "Evangeline: No. No, it's not. She was trying to freak me out, to just --", "Cristian: So wait a minute. If I asked you to marry me right now, you would say just no just like that? No \"let me think about it,\" or --", "Evangeline: You want to ask me to marry you?", "Cristian: Hypothetically speaking. If I asked you to marry me, you'd say no?", "Evangeline: I love you. I would say \"I love you.\" But you know, it's really --", "Cristian: I love you, too. I'm just kidding. I know it's too soon.", "Evangeline: Ok, I have something for you, too.", "Cristian: Ok.", "Evangeline: Ok. Ok.", "Cristian: Oh, no way.", "Evangeline: Open it. Open it. Ok. I know it's no substitute. And I -- I -- but I know you're an artist, and I wanted to get you something, you know, that you could use because you have a great eye. You are a great artist, Cristian. I will not let you give that up. Do you like it?", "Cristian: It's amazing. You're amazing. Merry Christmas.", "Evangeline: Merry Christmas.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nash: Hey.", "Jessica: Merry Christmas.", "Nash: Merry Christmas to you. Look, it's mommy.", "Jessica: Oh, hello, baby girl. Are you having a good Christmas with your daddy, huh?", "Nash: She is having an amazing Christmas. Santa Claus has been very good to her.", "Jessica: Yeah? It's a nice jacket.", "Nash: Yeah. Tess gave it to her.", "Jessica: She has good taste.", "Nash: So, was Santa Claus good to you?", "Jessica: Yeah. Um -- I got the locket you gave me. Um -- but I can't accept it.", "Nash: Why not?", "Jessica: Because I'm concerned about what it means.", "Nash: Well, what did you think it meant?", "Jessica: It just seems really personal, Nash.", "Nash: Open it. You haven't opened it. Open it up. It's not going to bite you. Open it, open it, open it.", "Jessica: Ok, ok. Huh. It's Bree.", "Nash: Of course it is.", "Jessica: Oh, I'm so sorry.", "Nash: It's so you can, you know, have her close -- close to your heart, like we --", "Jessica: I know.", "Nash: We talked about.", "Jessica: Thank you. Thank you. I get it.", "Nash: Well, I wanted to thank you for inviting me to spend Christmas with her.", "Jessica: You don't have to thank me for that.", "Nash: That's not all. I also wanted to thank you --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Antonio: Merry Christmas.", "Jessica: Hi! What a nice surprise.", "Antonio: Yeah, well, the work thing was a little quicker than I thought. I got your message that you were coming over, so I thought I'd meet you here.", "Antonio: Merry Christmas, Nash.", "Nash: Yeah.", "Antonio: Merry Christmas, baby.", "Jessica: Um -- look -- look at what Nash got me for Christmas.", "Antonio: Oh, that's --", "Jessica: It's got a picture of Bree inside.", "Antonio: Oh, that's nice. Here, let me.", "Jessica: Oh, thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Viki: Rex. Merry Christmas.", "Rex: You, too.", "Viki: I'm so glad you're here.", "Rex: Thanks.", "Viki: Everything ok?", "Rex: Sure, I guess.", "Viki: Is Adriana still upset about what Dorian did to her?", "Rex: The thing is, her anger towards her mother is eating her up inside. I've done some pretty awful things myself. But if Adriana would have never forgiven me, we wouldn't be together. So why can't she give her the same break?", "Viki: Yeah. Hey!", "Bo: Merry Christmas.", "Viki: Merry Christmas, Bo. Excuse me.", "Bo: And you, too, Balsom.", "Rex: Yeah, you, too.", "Bo: What's this?", "Rex: Don't get all weepy, but I got you a gift.", "Bo: Oh, well, I'll try to control the tears in my eye.", "Rex: I thought you'd enjoy a night at the opera with Paige. Kidding. They're for a Sixers game.", "Bo: You serious? Center court on the floor? Whoa -- wait a minute? Where'd you score tickets like this?", "Rex: One of the players comes into UV All the time. I figured you'd maybe like to take Paige and Matthew -- you know, whoever else.", "Bo: Oh, man, Paige and Matthew -- they love basketball. And so does Clint! Kidding! No, here you go. See you at courtside, Balsom.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Roxy: Holidays have a way of rekindling old flames, if you catch my drift.", "Clint: Actually, I don't.", "Roxy: Well, you and Viki are looking mighty cozy today.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Viki: Joey made this when he was 5 years old. He was very proud of it.", "Adriana: Never had the chance to make ornaments for Dorian's tree. Ah, she probably wouldn't have put them on. Too homemade-looking.", "Viki: Yeah. You know, when Natalie came back into my life, she was really, really angry with me because I hadn't raised her. But somehow, she managed to get past all that anger, and I'm very lucky to have her in my life.", "Adriana: Well, she's lucky to have you.", "Viki: I've made some terrible mistakes as a mother.
