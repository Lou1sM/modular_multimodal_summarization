        "Dorian lights the Llanview Christmas tree in Angel Square and makes some mayoral announcements. But she knows that Viki might need to \"Vent\" about her very frustrating situation with having Echo in her home with Charlie for Christmas so Dorian calls her. Viki admits to Dorian that she is ready to strangle Echo and willing to resort to drastic measures like having Dorian \"take care\" of Echo as only Dorian can do. Dorian then calls Echo to tells her she can give her $10,000 for taking some Christmas photos of the mayor dressed as Santa Clause. But when Echo goes to meet Dorian on the rooftop, Dorian locks her on the roof where it's cold. Echo then puts on Dorian's Santa suit in order not to freeze and knows the only way to get off the roof is to go down the chimney. And while Jack Manning wants to convince Sam that there is no Santa Claus, the two boys see somebody dressed like Santa on the roof and they knows that the person is coming down the chimney. Starr and Langston are together wondering what to do for Christmas and about whether Langston should see Robert and whether Starr should see James. But they meet the two brothers in Angel Square and the four of them are happily together with baby Hope."

        "Dorian: Thank you. Thank you all for coming. As mayor of Llanview, I'm honored to be here as we light this tree as an invitation to all of Llanview to celebrate this season of peace, compassion, and good will to all. Let the holiday begin!",

        "Echo: You know, I can't even imagine eggnog without bourbon in it.",
        "Charlie: Will you just give it a try here, hmm?",
        "Echo: Okay, okay. Ooh, ooh. Mmm.",
        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Echo: Ooh. Ooh, that's luscious. Yum.",
        "Charlie: Viki, eggnog?",
        "Viki: Yes. I'm just going to get the turkey in the oven first, okay?",
        "Echo: Oh, you know what? Let me help you with that, because you've just been slaving away and -- oh, oh, oh. The breast side is up.",
        "Viki: What are you doing?",
        "Echo: Well, if you start the turkey with the breast side down, then it won't get too brown.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but then you cannot baste it, can you?",
        "Echo: Well, it's just the way I've always done it.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, it's not the way I do it.",

        "Vimal: Mr. Buchanan, Merry Christmas. And thank you for my bonus. It was very generous.",
        "Clint: The least I could do.",
        "Vimal: And I hope your family has a happy Christmas, as well, now that you know that Brody Lovett is the father of your daughter's baby, and that Rex Balsom isn't your son.",
        "Clint: Vimal -- be quiet. I pay you for your silence, got it?",

        "John: Nope, not a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Here's to a family tradition. Christmas Eve pizza. What's the matter? It feels a little like home, right?",
        "James: We're not dodging Dad's beer bottles.",
        "Ford: Ah, so that's what we're missing. Look, James, it's going to be okay.",
        "James: How's it going to be okay, Bobby? Our kid brother is in jail for killing our dad. You know, can't we just forget Christmas?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How's Hope?",
        "Starr: You saw her. She practically cried the whole way home from Statesville. But she finally fell asleep.",
        "Langston: Well, at least you got to give Cole his Christmas presents today.",
        "Starr: After the guards tore them apart looking for whatever it is they look for.",
        "Langston: Well, he still seemed really happy to get them. That's something, right?",
        "Starr: It is. But without Cole, it just isn't Christmas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Only one? Shoot. That's not Santa. That's an old guy in a crummy suit.",
        "Sam: Is not!",
        "Jack: Wake up, Sam. Santa is not -- [Mumbling]",
        "Blair: Sam -- Dorian, will you watch Sam just a minute?",

        "Aubrey: It's my fault we're late.",
        "Joey: Oh, well, not completely.",
        "Aubrey: True. You were the one who gave me that spectacular gift, and I had to thank you properly for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Come on, sugarplum. Let's go put your Christmas dress on.",
        "Brody: Okay. Oh, no, not me?",
        "Jessica: Not you. The other sugarplum.",
        "Brody: Right.",
        "Natalie: Okay, which one is mine? 3 shakes, I can tell you what it is.",
        "John: Actually, I -- I bet it only takes one.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Shouldn't I wait?",
        "John: You have one for later. Why don't you open this one now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: It will cook more evenly this way.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah, and this is what? From your vast experience cook -- just leave it alone!",
        "Charlie: Echo -- Echo, why don't you help me bring the eggnog out to the family?",
        "Echo: Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Just trust me, Viki. You'll thank me later.",
        "Viki: Oh -- I mean it. I want you to let me do this my way! It's my kitchen!",
        "Echo: Just give it a try.",
        "Viki: Oh! Well, I guess this is the \"later\" part, when I'm supposed to thank you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Viki: Hello?",
        "Dorian: Merry Christmas, Viki. How's it going with Echo?",
        "Viki: Ha ha ha ha ha. We are hours away from dinner and I am seconds away from throttling that woman. Help me!",

        "Gigi: All right, it's time to go.",
        "Shane: Come on, I'm fine. It's not even cold.",
        "Gigi: Your father is still recovering from his accident and we have to get over to Viki's, right?",
        "Shane: Right. Grandma said she was going to make dessert. And Grandpa said he had something for me, too. I'm going to go say good-bye to Tyler.",
        "Gigi: Get. Grandma and Grandpa \u0096",
        "Rex: I know. It's still weird. Can't believe he got there so fast.",
        "Gigi: How are you doing with your instant family?",
        "Rex: I don't know.",
        "Gigi: For what it's worth, Charlie and Echo were very worried about you when you were in the hospital.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I got that.",
        "Gigi: And Shane seems happy.",
        "Rex: He does. So it's all good. Let's go see grandma and grandpa. Oh, look, it's the Grinch. Did you get a heads-up stealing Christmas?",
        "Vimal: Who was that?",
        "Clint: Rex Balsom.",
        "Vimal: That's your --",
        "Clint: Zip it, Vimal. Rex is nothing to you. Or to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Slams door shut]",
        "Viki: Echo is drooling all over the eggnog and Charlie, and not in that order. So far, she's managed to throw the turkey on the floor. I can't even imagine what she's going to do for an encore. She'll probably burn the house down so that \"Chuckles\" can rescue her.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I wouldn't put anything past that slut.",
        "Viki: You know, my entire family Christmas is now all about Echo. Dorian, I thought you were going to get rid of her for me.",
        "Dorian: Oh, the wheels are in motion. But it sounds like you can use help tonight.",
        "Viki: I would say such nice things about you, even in public.",
        "Dorian: Be of good cheer, Viki. This is the season for miracles. Okay, everybody. Time for us to go home.",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. Come on, boys. Let's go.",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki, Echo feels just terrible about what happened to the turkey.",
        "Viki: Yeah, true.",
        "Charlie: Are you okay?",
        "Viki: Hmm. Actually, I suddenly feel ever so much better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: You know, most men hate shopping, but Joey actually likes it.",
        "Joey: No. You're inspiring.",
        "Kelly: Hey, there's your dad.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, no. I should go hide behind the tree. I'm sure he's not going to be happy to see me.",
        "Joey: But he loves Kelly. Maybe you can go over there and soften him up, and then get him to accept our engagement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Vimal, I never again want to hear about what you did. I am grateful, you've been rewarded, now quit while you're ahead.",
        "Joey: Hey, Dad. Did you make it in time for the big show? I heard it was prime Dorian.",
        "Clint: Oh. Here. Take that to the office. Go.",
        "Joey: Merry Christmas, Dad.",
        "Clint: Joey, Merry Christmas to you, too. Hello, Kel.",
        "Kelly: Hi.",
        "Clint: I hope that Zane likes that saddle that I sent over to him.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no, he'll love it. He'll love it. You know he rides western even without your help.",
        "Clint: Well, I'm just trying to make sure.",
        "Joey: Hey, will you see you over at Mom's later?",
        "Clint: I guess so.",
        "Joey: What's up with him?",
        "Aubrey: It's simple. He hates me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Do you think Nate really killed Dad?",
        "Ford: Well, they found the gun in his apartment. Somebody said they saw him at the motel.",
        "James: I don't believe it. I mean, he hardly knew him. Dad never laid a hand on him. Nate's got it together.",
        "Ford: That's because he's never been pushed. In fact, he and Mom have had trouble with money.",
        "James: Yeah, our mom. \"Our.\"",
        "Ford: He's never been hit. He's never seen Inez hit. And if Eddie went after Inez, he might have snapped.",
        "James: I guess.",
        "Ford: What?",
        "James: Bobby, our -- our dad was murdered, and I don't feel anything.",
        "Ford: Okay. You're relieved. Or you will be. That man tortured you your entire life. You're not supposed to feel bad now.",
        "James: Well, I feel bad for Nate.",
        "Ford: Okay, me, too, but there's nothing we can do about it tonight.",
        "James: So what should we do, celebrate?",
        "Ford: No, I guess -- huh -- I guess you're right. Christmas is kind of cancelled around here. Why don't you go spend it with Starr?",
        "James: This is her first Christmas without Cole. I have no business being over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You sure you don't want me to call James and Ford? I'm sure they'd come over.",
        "Starr: Uh-uh. No, that doesn't feel right. Plus, they're probably at the jail with Nate.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but I'm sure they wouldn't be there for much longer, especially if their mom's already there.",
        "Starr: And Dani. I can't believe that Dani could lose Nate the same way that I lost Cole.",
        "Langston: Eh -- we don't know what's going to happen, okay? Look, Dorian and everybody will be home soon. We'll have a party, open some presents. It'll be fun.",
        "Starr: Oh, if it weren't for Hope, I would go into my room and pull the covers over my head and not wake up until Christmas is over.",
        "Langston: You would skip presents? Really? You would skip my present?",
        "Starr: Well, I wouldn't want to hurt your feelings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It's not really a Christmas present. Go ahead.",
        "Natalie: It's your mother's ring. You're really giving it to me this time?",
        "John: It didn't feel right last time.",
        "Natalie: But you're ready now?",
        "John: Yeah. That ring's been in the family a long time. And now we're going to be a family. It feels right.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Put it on me.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? You -- I mean, you're sure? I mean, what happened to our secret engagement and all that?",
        "Natalie: I don't care. I changed my mind. We're going to tell everybody tonight. We're engaged.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Aubrey, my dad doesn't hate you.",
        "Aubrey: He didn't even say hello.",
        "Joey: That's just him. Tell her, Kelly. Nobody hates you. My dad is just overprotective. It's genetic. My grandfather Asa was the same way, right? He's sure that -- that everyone's out to get a piece of the Buchanan money and his job is to scare away all the gold diggers. I mean, he thinks that everyone who comes into our family is there to bleed us dry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Okay, I got the turkey all cleaned up and it's in the oven, breast up, just the way you like it. No one's ever going to know the difference.",
        "Charlie: Merry Christmas. Come on in!",
        "Echo: Oh, look. It's our family. Hi.",
        "Gigi: Merry Christmas. Can I put these under the tree?",
        "Echo: Um, you know what? Maybe Shane and I could find a place for those?",
        "Viki: Anytime now, Dorian. Anytime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Merry Christmas.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "[Joey chuckles]",
        "Kelly: Goggles.",
        "Joey: Protective eyewear, in case you ever decide to squeeze a lemon again.",
        "Kelly: Ha ha ha! Oh, I will think of you. How do they look?",
        "Joey: You're ready for laps.",
        "Kelly: Great. Thank you very much.",
        "Joey: Yeah, you're welcome.",
        "Kelly: I have something for you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Starr: I thought this might help with your no-sex stress.",
        "Langston: Oh, wow. Ha ha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: How much longer till that 6 months is up?",
        "Ford: Not for a while. Thanks. And it might be even longer, now that she thinks I might be a murderer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: It's perfect.",
        "Starr: Yes, well, I figured, since we didn't get to take that boxing class, that we would try something different, like yoga.",
        "Langston: Okay. Yeah, well, I'll try anything. Except it doesn't really matter anymore. I basically accused Ford of murdering his father, so I don't know if he'll get over that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Oh, my God. My shirt! My favorite shirt! I thought I lost this in high school. Dude, where did you find it?",
        "James: I took it. Well, you wouldn't let me borrow it, so I had to steal it.",
        "Ford: Okay. And you've had it all this time?",
        "James: Yeah. I -- I figured it was time I gave it back.",
        "Ford: Well, it's the only thing I left you with.",
        "James: Just forget it and try it on, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I love my present. Thank you. Oh, I do not know what I would do without you.",
        "Langston: Is that a smile? Are you feeling a little Christmassy?",
        "Starr: A little bit.",
        "Langston: A little bit? Ha ha ha.",
        "Starr: But I'm not in the mood to hear Cramer women toasts.",
        "Langston: Yeah, um -- okay, well, I got an idea. Want to get out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Okay, that's it. I'm not sitting around here like a bunch of Christmas losers. It's Christmas. Grab your jingle bells, twinkle toes. Let's go.",
        "James: Where? You want to go up on the roof and watch for Santa?",
        "Ford: Why not? You got someplace you'd rather be?",
        "James: Are you serious?",
        "Ford: Yeah, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Shut up!",
        "Jack: It's true.",
        "Sam: It's not true!",
        "Jack: You should learn the truth now so you get better presents when you know who does the buying.",
        "Sam: I wrote letters to Santa.",
        "Jack: He's a myth -- invented by toy stores so they make more money.",
        "Sam: You're lying!",
        "Jack: Sam, where do most of our presents come from? Logan's --",
        "Blair: Ya, ya, ya, ya -- stand up here. Listen -- listen, your brother -- he doesn't know what he's talking about. Santa -- he has lots -- lots of helpers all over the world. Why don't you go run and take your coat off, okay? And you -- if you ruin this for your brother, all your presents -- your little personal elf will take them back, got it?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Blair: Yes. Excuse me.",
        "Dorian: You're excused. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",
        "Jack: I'm just going to shake them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Hey, Gigi, let me take those for you. Come here.",
        "Shane: You need some help putting those under the tree?",
        "Echo: Right. You just want to go poke your nose under that tree and find your presents, don't you?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Echo: Oh. Excuse me. Dorian, this isn't a good time.",
        "Dorian: Don't hang up. How would you like to make a quick 10 grand?",
        "Viki: Why don't we get the eggnog into the other room?",
        "Rex: I'll get it.",
        "Viki: Go ahead.",
        "Charlie: You can help me.",
        "Echo: I'm listening.",
        "Dorian: Come to La Boulaie quick, and bring your camera.",
        "Echo: I'm spending Christmas with my family.",
        "Dorian: Look, don't you need the money? This is a civic project for a nice check, and it'll only take an hour.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: It's official? It's out in the open?",
        "Natalie: Well, we're telling everybody tonight.",
        "Gigi: What about Marty?",
        "Natalie: Uh \u0096",
        "Rex: I thought you were afraid this would set her off and she'd spill about Brody and the baby?",
        "Natalie: I was.",
        "Rex: What happened?",
        "Echo: I have to go run an errand.",
        "Viki: Oh. Well, we'll save you some eggnog.",
        "Charlie: Echo, are you okay?",
        "Echo: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Charlie: Well, then why are you running off like that, alone?",
        "Echo: Well, if you want to come with me, I wouldn't say no.",
        "Viki: Charlie, you are not going to leave with Echo.",
        "Charlie: Well, it is the last thing I want to do, but you know what this is. She's sneaking out for a drink.",
        "Viki: No, I don't -- I -- I don't think so. Really. Besides, she was the one who said she wanted to take responsibility for herself.",
        "Echo: So your grandpa and I are just going to run out for a little bit.",
        "Shane: Well, why do both of you have to go?",
        "Echo: Uh, well, we don't, really. Why don't you stay with the family?",
        "Charlie: Echo, if you need m --",
        "Echo: Charlie, I don't need a baby-sitter. Okay? And we're all going to go out for dinner later this -- next week, okay? And it's going to be on me -- to make up for this whole mess. Okay?",
        "Rex: See ya.",
        "Viki: Drive safely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Oh. It's a shame you're not staying.",
        "Echo: Yes, yes. Yes, it is.",
        "Clint: Is everybody here?",
        "Echo: Oh, yeah, everybody's here. Including Charlie with his brand-new son and grandson.",
        "Clint: Isn't that sweet?",
        "Echo: Yes, Clint, it is sweet. And what you're doing to him is evil, trying to make him think he has a family of his own.",
        "Clint: Oh, come on. You're milking this for everything it's worth. Using it to get close to Charlie. So you can drop the moral outrage.",
        "Echo: Where did he go? Where did that guy go? When did you turn into Asa? Because you're not one little bit of the man who made love to me.",
        "Clint: Oh, that man smartened up a long time ago.",
        "Echo: Really? Well, he's not smart enough, because he's the only one who's alone and bitter. You gave up an incredible son, Clint, and grandson.",

        "John: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "John: Shall we get this over with? Yeah? Okay. Excuse me, everyone. We're very sorry to interrupt, but we just wanted to say that I asked Natalie to marry me and in a temporary lapse in judgment on her part, she said yes.",
        "Charlie: That's fantastic! Great! Well, congratulations. Mm.",
