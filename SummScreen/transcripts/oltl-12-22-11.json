{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 11091"], "Recap": ["Shane has pressured Neela to reveal to him that she has \"gotten the goods\" on Jack by telling her that his mom is dead because of Jack. She is very reluctant to give Jack up however since she seems to like him and he seems to be developing a conscience by confiding in her and admitting to her how remorseful he is for what happened to Gigi. But she gives him the tape recording of Jack confessing everything. Jack then surprises Todd by inviting him to spend Christmas at Blair's home where Blair, Starr, and even Jack welcome him. Tea, however, is hiding her rage over believing that Todd killed her husband and set her brother up and only shares with John what she knows. In Paris, TX, the professor (who looks just like Delphina) knows that both Rex and Gigi/Stacy need to know something about the night when Gigi \"allegedly\" died. So they find a television screen that reveals the night in question."], "Recap Author": "Jennifer S.", "Show Title": "One Life to Live", "Transcript": ["Rex: Get the hell out of here before I change my mind and finish you off!", "Cutter: Wait. Wait. I have something to say, and you both need to hear it.", "Rex: Why? It's just more lies. I don't want to hear it.", "Cutter: I told you I'm done lying, all right? Please, just listen. I've got to get this off my chest. Truth is... you're not Stacy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Ringing]", "Shane: Come on, Neela. Pick up.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Neela: Hello?", "Shane: Hi, Neela. It's me, Shane.", "Neela: Hi.", "Shane: I just got back from Texas, and I was wondering, did you get anywhere with Jack?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: Jack? What happened?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] Thank you, John. I'm gonna be fine, all right?", "John: Yeah, I know, but you know what the doc said, right? No stress.", "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles] And how exactly am I supposed to do that, huh, knowing that Todd killed Victor and I can't even tell my own daughter?", "Danielle: Tell me what?", "T\u00e9a: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: I don't know you that well, but seems like something's bothering you.", "Jack: I swear to God I didn't know that generator was there. I didn't mean for her to die. But she did... because of me.", "Todd: What's going on? Something happen with Neela?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Neela: Shane, I have to go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shane: Wait. Did you get Jack to confess? Neela, please. I got to know. My dad's on his way back from Texas, and I want to tell him that this is finally over, that we can make Jack Manning pay for killing my mom.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Stacy: Cutter, what are you talking about?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rex: It's just more lies. I know that doctor operated on you.", "Cutter: He operated on Stacy Morasco, okay? But this isn't Stacy. There's no marks. There's no scars, no stitches. That's why he wouldn't operate on you. There's nothing to reverse. This is the way you were born.", "Rex: What are you saying?", "Cutter: The woman standing right here is Gigi Morasco.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "T\u00e9a: Oh, it's nothing, mija.", "Danielle: Oh, so now it's a secret.", "T\u00e9a: No.", "Danielle: Wait. Mom, there's nothing wrong with the baby?", "T\u00e9a: No, no. Honey, no, it's like I told you on the phone. It was just a few cramps. I'm fine now.", "Danielle: Okay, so what's the big secret?", "John: Your mom was just talking about Christmas presents.", "Danielle: Oh! I'm sorry! And here I was Christmas shopping all afternoon. I got you something really nice.", "T\u00e9a: Yeah?", "Danielle: I even got Todd something.", "T\u00e9a: Why would you get something for him?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: What happened? I thought you were just gonna sit around my office and spend all my money on take-out food.", "Jack: We did. I just wanted to wash my face.", "Todd: Oh. You got lipstick on your face. [Laughs] That's great.", "Neela: I can't talk right now.", "Shane: Okay, it's better if we talk in person, anyway. Can you meet me at angel square?", "Neela: No, I can't.", "Shane: Why not? Neela, this is really important to me. Please meet me.", "Neela: Shane, I --", "[Click]", "Neela: Shane? [Scoffs] Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.", "Todd: No, it's all good. Isn't that right, Jack?", "Neela: I have to go. Thank you very much for lunch. It was really great.", "Jack: You're leaving?", "Todd: Uh, scrooge has got to get back to work.", "Neela: Merry Christmas.", "Todd: Bah, humbug.", "Jack: Hey, why are you leaving? Is it because of what I told you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aubrey: Hey, Shane. You want to help me put up the star on the tree, make sure it's ready for when your dad gets home?", "Shane: That's okay. I got to go meet Neela. I'm hoping she finally got Jack to confess. That'd be like the best Christmas present ever. You know, for my dad.", "Aubrey: I know how happy that would make him. But you know, Shane, there's no guarantee that Neela will be able to get Jack to talk. And even if she does, if she likes him, she might want to keep his confidence.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: I know it was pretty serious what I did to Shane's mom, but I was just hoping you'd understand, you know, that you'd believe me when I said it was an accident. I didn't mean for her to die, Neela.", "Neela: I know. I believe you.", "Jack: So why are you so freaked out? I mean, I don't blame you, but you said you could handle it. You said that I could trust you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cutter: You're Gigi.", "Rex: Just shut up, okay?! No more games! That's it!", "Cutter: I told you. This isn't a game. I'm not lying, all right? I'm just trying to set things right. For the past couple months, you've been trying to figure out who you are, where you came from. I've been standing in your way, but I can't lie to you anymore.", "Rex: All you do is lie, okay? You're just looking to figure out a way to cash in on that face, Gigi's face. Okay, now, I'm not saying that she's innocent, but you're the scum of the earth.", "Stacy: Cutter, I don't understand. Why are you doing this?", "Cutter: Because I care about you, Gigi.", "Rex: [Grunts] Don't you call her that! Don't ever call her that!", "Stacy: Oh! Oh, God.", "Cutter: [Sighs]", "Stacy: Rex, I understand how you feel. Cutter tried to con you. You wanted to pass me off as Gigi. But I didn't let him! We were leaving town! He doesn't deserve to get arrested!", "Rex: Look, Stacy, I understand that you have spent months with this guy. I get that you care about him, okay? But he's not just a con man. He's a murderer.", "Cutter: [Mumbling]", "Stacy: What?!", "Rex: He's wanted in Kentucky for murder! He framed his own sister for the crime.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aubrey: [Exhales] You made it back! Rama, hi.", "Rama: Gosh, Aubrey, don't look so disappointed. I brought you a Christmas present. How are things with Rex?", "Aubrey: He's still in Texas.", "Rama: What?! It's Christmas eve!", "Aubrey: He got bumped from his flight. I don't know when he's gonna be home.", "Rama: Has he called you?", "Aubrey: No. He's having second thoughts about everything with us. I just know it.", "Rama: No, that can't be true. You said he wanted to spend Christmas with you, and he kissed you.", "Aubrey: He shouldn't have. And I shouldn't have let him. [Sighs] It was too much too soon. I blew it, Rama! He's not ready to say goodbye to Gigi yet.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rex: If you don't believe me, just ask his sister. She'll tell you that her brother's a lying, thieving, murdering bastard.", "Cutter: [Mumbling]", "Rex: You can forget all of that, uh, \"Stacy's actually Gigi\" crap. You're just trying to get me to call off the cops. It's not gonna work. I saw her body.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Neela: I have to go.", "Jack: Why?", "Neela: Because it's -- it's Christmas eve, and my brother's expecting me.", "Jack: So it's not what I said?", "Neela: No. Of course not.", "Jack: Are you sure? Because I know it's bad. I killed Shane's mom. So if you don't want to be my friend, I --", "Neela: No, it's not that. I want to be your friend very much.", "Jack: So I can trust you? 'Cause you have no idea how good it feels to be able to talk to someone.", "Neela: I have to go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danielle: Why shouldn't I get Todd a present? He got me one. He got you one, too.", "T\u00e9a: He really shouldn't have.", "Danielle: I thought it was kind of nice of him. And then why shouldn't I get him one? I mean... he is my father --", "T\u00e9a: No, he's not. Don't you ever say that. Victor is your father. Todd is not your father.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: Hey. I think there might be one or two things you didn't order off the take-out menu.", "Jack: You said we could get whatever we wanted.", "Todd: I'm not complaining. Except about this. Think it's got raisins in it. What? What happened?", "Jack: Neela left.", "Todd: Well, I can tell that, but what happened before she left? She had this look on her face, like she'd had bad popadams.", "Jack: I don't know what you're talking about.", "Todd: It's like a flat bread. Jack, you know, there's nothing that you can't tell me.", "Jack: There's nothing to tell. Anyway, I don't need you. I've got Neela.", "Todd: Why? What'd you say to Neela?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shane: Neela! Thanks for meeting me. Were you able to get anything out of Jack? We got a suspect in custody. Yeah, he's wanted in Kentucky on a murder rap.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Stacy: Murder. Well, so much for being completely honest with each other about everything. You conveniently left out the part about committing murder. And you pinned the crime on your sister? How could you do that?! And what was this?! You said you cared about me. That was just all another lie?", "Rex: Another score. He was trying to pass you off as Gigi one last time.", "Cutter: Not -- I'm not lying. You are Gigi. I swear on my life!", "Rex: Which isn't worth much!", "Stacy: I'm sorry, Rex. I had no idea. All these weeks, I -- oh, my God. I trusted him, and who knows if anything he said was true? What?", "Rex: I just don't know what I'm doing here. I have somebody back in Llanview who really cares about me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rama: Listen, I better go. Vimal and Neela will be waiting for me, okay?", "Aubrey: I think Neela's with Shane.", "Rama: With Shane? What's she doing with Shane?", "Aubrey: They're friends, I think. You know, I'm sure they know each other from school.", "Rama: Yeah, but I hope he's not looking for something more, because she's head-over-heels in love with Jack Manning.", "Aubrey: Yeah, you need to watch that.", "Rama: What do you mean?", "Aubrey: Jack Manning is... and handful. He's rich and entitled --", "Rama: Rich is good.", "Aubrey: Sometimes. But you know the rumor is he's responsible for Gigi Morasco's death.", "Rama: Yeah, but they dropped all the charges and arrested someone else.", "Aubrey: Uh-huh.", "Rama: Unless there's something you're not telling me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shane: Please, Neela. It's Christmas eve. All I want to do is tell my dad that I finally got Jack to admit what he did. Please tell me you got something. Please. I've got to get some good news for my dad or...I don't know what I'm gonna do.", "Neela: No. Don't say that. It will be okay.", "Shane: No, it won't! Don't you get it? The longer it takes, the worse it gets. I need something, anything.", "Neela: Okay.", "Shane: \"Okay\" what? He confessed?", "Neela: Yes... he did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: Jack, I know it's Christmas, and I know that Victor's not here. And that's got to be hard for you.", "Jack: It's not your problem.", "Todd: I'm really sorry that the two of you can't be together, Jack. I'm really sorry.", "Jack: Why? It's not like it's your fault. Look, I'm sorry. I know I blamed you at first. But I guess I finally accepted the truth. I know you didn't do it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danielle: What do you mean he's not my father?", "T\u00e9a: Sit down. Sit down. Listen to me. Parenthood does not come down to just biology. Victor loved you very much.", "Danielle: I know. I know. Okay? And I loved him. But I don't want to feel like I'm being disloyal to Victor or you if I want to get to know Todd. He is my biological father. And, you know, he's trying, and I just... you know, I want to try, too.", "T\u00e9a: Well, um...", "John: No. No, it's not. If -- if I may speak? Your mom's too brave to admit it, but she's -- she might be a little sensitive right now, with the baby coming.", "T\u00e9a: Yeah. [Chuckles]", "[Doorbell rings]", "Danielle: I'll get it.", "T\u00e9a: Don't say it, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nate: Merry Christmas.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Stacy: I can't believe they just dragged him off like that, like -- like a criminal.", "Rex: Stacy, he's a murderer. You should consider yourself lucky. I could have turned you in, too.", "Stacy: Me? Why?", "Rex: Uh, well, according to Kim, uh, your plan was to take Gigi's place on our wedding day. For all I know, you would have killed her if Jack hadn't gotten there first.", "Stacy: Rex, I know that I've lost my memory, but that's not who I am. I'm not a killer. I don't care how much everyone says I wanted you. I would never hurt anyone, especially not my own sister.", "Rex: Okay, so -- so what was the plan, Stacy? You were just gonna, uh, show up in Llanview one day and say, \"hey, Gigi, guess what! Uh, I'm not dead. I got plastic surgery so that I could look like you. Uh, would you mind stepping aside so that I can have your life?\"", "Stacy: I don't know what the plan was, because I can't remember! And trust me, I would give anything to go back in time just to see what really happened that night!", "Prof. Fina: Well, perhaps you can. here?", "Rex: How do you know him?", "Stacy: I sat next to him at the airport. How do you know him?", "Rex: He just judged the pie competition. What are you doing here?", "Prof. Fina: Well, I, uh, I came back for my glasses. I just couldn't stand the idea of a long flight without being able to --", "Rex: These what you're looking for?", "Prof. Fina: That, sir, is amazing. How did you find them?", "Rex: Lucky, I guess.", "Prof. Fina: Well, we all have our talents, don't we? [Chuckles] And you, miss, were you able to find what you were looking for? Hmm?", "Stacy: No, in fact, I'm more confused than ever.", "Prof. Fina: Ah, well, remember my motto, which is, um...what is it? Oh, yes! Don't give up!", "Rex: Is that why that book you gave me says \"don't give up\" on every page? No, I don't get it. When I opened this book before, every page was blank except for \"don't give up.\"", "Prof. Fina: It's a wonderful motto...and, incidentally, a wonderful book. [Chuckles] Uh, my father was an expert in time travel. Which reminds me. You said something as I came through the door, uh, something about -- what was it? Oh, yes! You wanted to go back in time. Well, when, exactly? I mean, what point in time do you wish to revisit, hmm?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danielle: This is exactly the one I wanted. How did you know?!", "Nate: 'Cause I know you. I'm glad you like it.", "Danielle: I love it. Thank you. I got you something, too.", "Nate: You didn't have to do that.", "Danielle: Yeah. I know. But I did.", "Nate: I am just happy to be back in your life.", "Danielle: Yeah, after spending all that time with rick powers... now I understand what you were dealing with.", "Nate: Still, that night was --", "Danielle: Kind of life-changing. In more ways than one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "T\u00e9a: I know I came dangerously close to spilling the beans. I know. [Sighs]", "John: Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything, okay, but now that you mention it, listen, I think the best way to protect your brother is to hide how you feel about Todd.", "T\u00e9a: [Scoffs] Just the least bit challenging, detective, knowing that he murdered my husband and is framing my brother, and I'm supposed to be happy now that my daughter is buying him Christmas presents.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: Here. Buy your girlfriend something pretty for Christmas.", "Jack: No, no.", "Todd: Jack, shut up and take the money.", "Jack: I did kind of want to buy her something nice... after everything she's done for me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shane: Jack confessed? I don't believe it! Yes! Oh, my God. This is amazing. What did he say?!", "Neela: Shane, he told me how he bullied you and how things got so bad that you -- you tried to kill yourself.", "Shane: Yeah. And? What else did he say? Everyone already knows that.", "Neela: That's not enough? I mean, I thought it was pretty amazing that he was able to admit to something so terrible.", "Shane: Yeah, it's terrible. But I'm still here. My mom isn't. She's dead because of him. So what else did he say?", "Neela: Nothing. That's it.", "Shane: You sure that's all he said?", "Neela: I'm so sorry, Shane.", "Shane: I was just really... I wanted all of this to be settled before my dad got back. Was really hoping you could get it all on tape.", "Neela: Your dad will understand. You did the best you could, Shane.", "Shane: No, I didn't. Don't you get it, Neela? This is all my fault. Jack wasn't trying to get my mom. He was trying to get me. My mom wanted to get back at him. She walked into that trap because of me. I should have been the one that died, not her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rama: Aubrey, what do you know about Jack Manning?", "Aubrey: Just that he is not a good influence for Neela.", "Rama: Believe me, Vimal's keeping her on a very tight leash. So she's fine.", "Aubrey: Oh, yeah? Like he did with you? Have we forgotten Llanview's best arms?", "Rama: I got a Christmas card from him.", "Aubrey: Shut up! Has Vimal seen it?", "Rama: He addressed it to all of us. He's very happy. He met someone new.", "Aubrey: Oh. I'm sorry.", "Rama: What's a man supposed to do, pine for me for the rest of his life? Anyway, I can't stop Neela from feeling what she's feeling. She's a teenager with a crush, so...", "Aubrey: I guess no one's immune. I found it in the decorations. I don't know. Do I put it up? Would that be weird? I mean, she's dead. It's not like Santa has anything for her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Stacy: Are you saying you can take us back in time?", "Rex: Oh, he couldn't find the glasses on the top of his head. I'm sure he can't find his way back in time. All right, I got to go. I got a flight to catch.", "Prof. Fina: Ah, yes. I don't think anyone will be flying tonight. Except maybe the jolly man, the red suit. [Chuckles]", "Stacy: I almost forgot it was Christmas.", "Prof. Fina: Ah, young man, you think I might see that book that I lent you, my father's book? Yes. See, that's my father, professor Delbert Fina, sr. Yes. Yes. He was a world-renowned theoretical physicist. Made great and amazing breakthroughs in time travel in the 1960s.", "Rex: Yeah, him and the other dead heads.", "Prof. Fina: Yes. As I remember, he told me a story once of a young couple, much like yourselves --", "Rex: We're not a couple.", "Prof. Fina: All right, then. This couple, now, they, back then, did not actually belong in 1968. No. No. And my father was able to help them get back to the future.", "Rex: 1968?", "Prof. Fina: Yes. You see, my father had discovered a discontinuity in the space-time continuum. Yes? No? All right. In layman's terms, it's a -- it's a -- what do you call that? Yes, a door. Hmm. And this door or portal, if you prefer, only opens every... 20 years, just briefly. So first 1968 and then, of course, 1988 and, well -- what's the next one? Oh, yes. 2008. And then --", "Stacy: 2028. That's 17 years from now. I can't wait that long. I need to know what happened the night that my sister, Gigi, died.", "Prof. Fina: And when was that, my dear?", "Rex: This year. 2011.", "Prof. Fina: 2011. That can be arranged.", "Rex: Are you serious? I thought you said this door only opened every 20 years.", "Prof. Fina: Well, yes. It is true that human beings can only pass through the portal every 20 years. But there are other ways which one can look back in time. Yes. I've devoted my life to capitalizing on my father's discoveries. And even with the naysaying of the modern scientific community and lack of funds and -- all right, I'll say it -- outright obstruction by the F.A.A. -- Hmph! -- I've made headway. Haven't I? Hmm.", "Stacy: So you can send us back.", "Prof. Fina: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Ha! I can, however -- I-I can give you some answers.", "Stacy: How?", "Prof. Fina: Well, if you can pinpoint the exact time that you want to go to -- if I could just find -- I hope I didn't pack that. Very hard on electronic devices when you fly these days -- ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah. Yes. [Sighs] Isn't that beautiful?", "Stacy: It looks like a TV remote.", "Prof. Fina: It does! Doesn't it?", "Stacy: So, what exactly does it do?", "Prof. Fina: This? You mean my, uh, space-time navigator? Why, it takes you back in time, of course! [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nate: Oh, my God! I heard about this book. My acting teacher was telling us about this.", "Danielle: Good. Now you have it.", "Nate: [Chuckles]", "Danielle: What? You want to be an actor, so...", "Nate: After what happened with rick, I...I wasn't sure how you still felt about it.", "Danielle: Nate... it's not like you wanted to be A... you want to do real movies, you know, or plays or TV. I know that. And I know you're gonna be great.", "Nate: Thanks.", "Danielle: You're welcome.", "Nate: I really appreciate you believing in me. And I swear I'm gonna make it up. This is my year to get it right.", "Danielle: Hey, I just want to be there opening night.", "Nate: I'm not going anywhere without you. I missed you so much.", "Danielle: I missed you, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "John: Look, maybe it's better if we just -- we don't, uh, we don't talk about Todd, all right? I'll keep you updated, I promise, but you don't need to call --", "T\u00e9a: Call you every five minutes?", "John: Call me every five minutes. No, you don't. Not that I don't like hearing from you.", "T\u00e9a: [Laughs]", "John: Look, you do what you want, but I think it might be best if, you know, you, uh... keep your distance from him, all right? Just try to stay away. He already knows something's up.", "T\u00e9a: What do you mean?", "John: Look, if he did this, you know, he's lying to everyone in town, all right, which is gonna make him more paranoid than he already is. You come at him with all this animosity, and, uh, you know, he's gonna figure out that you know he's lying.", "T\u00e9a: I-I apologized to him --", "John: Right. I know. I think he bought it. Okay, but you want to keep your brother safe, and you want to keep that baby safe, all right? Why don't you just try going easy?", "T\u00e9a: This baby won't have a father because of him. I know. [Breathes deeply] [Chuckles] I will keep my cool, detective. All right? I won't talk to him. [Sighs] I won't see him. I-I won't even think about him. How does -- does that make you happy?", "John: It makes me happy. See this?", "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles] Oh, those are pretty.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danielle: They're for you. \"Wishing you a speedy recovery and Feliz Navidad.\"", "T\u00e9a: Are these from you?", "Danielle: They're from Todd.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: Thanks for the cash.", "Todd: Yeah. She's a pretty girl. She seems very nice.", "Jack: She is. But I've got to go. You know, mom's expecting me -- Christmas eve and everything.", "Todd: Merry Christmas, Jack.", "Jack: What are you doing for Christmas?", "Todd: Not sure. It's that big of a holiday for me. You know, in fact, I didn't even bother to go -- to celebrate it the last eight years.", "Jack: Do you want to come over tonight?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Neela: Don't say that, Shane. You're scaring me.", "Shane: Just wish I could go back in time. My mom died trying to protect me. I know I can't bring her back. I just thought maybe if I could get Jack to admit that he locked her in that basement, if I could make him pay, then it would help my dad find some peace. But I'll never be able to do that.", "Neela: I'm so sorry, Shane.", "Shane: It's not your fault. It's mine. All of this is my fault.", "Neela: Shane, wait!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rama: Forget about the stocking. It's a silly tradition, anyway. What can possibly fit in a stocking? Hmm. Jewelry.", "[Both laugh]", "Rama: I'm glad you're laughing. Listen, come home with me. Leave this sad house. You can spend the holidays with Vimal, Neela, and me.", "Aubrey: Okay, I'm gonna take you up on that.", "Rama: Ah! Yay! [Chuckles] Okay, come on.", "Aubrey: Oh, actually, I just want to wait for Shane to make sure that he gets to Viki's safely.", "Rama: Yes?", "Aubrey: It's the least I can do for his dad.", "Rama: You're getting that look on your face again.", "Aubrey: What look?!", "Rama: The same look you had on your face with Joey.", "Aubrey: Oh, I don't have any look. I will see you later, with your present.", "Rama: Deal! And, Aubrey... I know it's been a terrible year. But this coming year will be different. You'll get your happy ending. And you'll meet the man of your dreams. I promise. Love you. Bye.", "Aubrey: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Stacy: So, how does it work?", "Rex: It doesn't. Don't you get it? This guy's a con artist, like your pal Cutter.", "Prof. Fina: Now, as I understand confidence men, they are all trying to, uh, what's it? Oh, yes. Fleece their marks.", "Rex: Exactly.", "Prof. Fina: Well, I want nothing. Have I asked for anything? No. I want only to help this young lady find some answers.", "Stacy: Why would you do that for me?", "Prof. Fina: Why? For research, of course! Pff! I'm always finding ways to expand my knowledge. That and, uh, I have a weakness for brunettes.", "Rex: See? That explains it.", "Prof. Fina: Mr. Balsom! That is his name, yes, Mr. Balsom? Mr. Balsom, I am a scientist. I do not believe in -- in random events. I believe in cause and effect. Now, you -- you left the airport, and you came here for a reason. And you, sir, you gave up your seat and you came -- where? Here! -- For a reason. And I-I -- well, I came here for my glasses, which you very rightly pointed out were on my very head! Hmph! Now, that says to me that something big is behind this.", "Stacy: What?", "Prof. Fina: Simultaneity. Syzygy. [Scoffs] Let's just call it \"fate,\" then, shall we? Fate.", "Rex: Fate? And you call yourself a scientist.", "Stacy: I don't care what he calls himself! If he can get me some answers, it's worth it. Rex, I need to know how my sister died, because I know it wasn't because of me. I would never have hurt her, ever. What do you need from us?", "Prof. Fina: Well, some information would be good. Uh, let's start with where this event happened. Where did it take place?", "Rex: Llanview, Pennsylvania.", "Prof. Fina: Oh, of course. Llanview, where you're from. [Chuckles] Wouldn't be Kalamazoo, would it? Here we got. Ha! And, uh, the exact date, the date that it took place.", "Rex: My wedding day, June 13th.", "Prof. Fina: Ah, June 13th. Oh. My, that -- that is unfortunate. Yes.", "[Beeping]", "Prof. Fina: All right. Now, let's see. We have to apply... for variables... interviewer bias... oh, and, of course, the null hypothesis. Forget that, you might explode. There we go. Good. [Clears throat] Now, we need a screen.", "Rex: A screen?", "Prof. Fina: Yes. So we can see the -- have I not made myself clear?! Hmm?! I will not be able to take you into the past. You will, however, be able to view all the events as they transpired. Hmm? A Smartphone will do. Although I do get distracted by that game with the birds. It's a fun game. That's not right.", "Stacy: Here's a TV. Will this work?", "Prof. Fina: Yes. Yes, of course. Bring that right over here. Right. Now, we just have to, uh... let's see... recalibrate for the time-space navigator. Would either of you know how to turn this on?", "Stacy: Oh! Uh...", "Prof. Fina: Oh. Well, of course. Very smart. Right. All right. Well... shall we?", "Stacy: Heh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Static]", "Danielle: That was really nice of him.", "T\u00e9a: Yes. Really, really very nice of him.", "John: Very nice.", "Danielle: All right, I've got stuff to wrap. Don't come in my room without knocking.", "T\u00e9a: Okay, sweetheart. Can you believe the nerve of that bastard? He kills my husband, and then he sends me flowers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: Jack, are you inviting me to Christmas eve?", "Jack: Just forget it.", "Todd: No, I -- I-I appreciate it. It's just, uh... [Chuckles] It's a little bit of a surprise. That's all.", "Jack: Oh, don't go crazy. You were gonna make me invite you eventually.", "Todd: Well, definitely, but... still, it's nice to hear you say it first. Thank you. I will. You're welcome.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shane: I've got to go, Neela.", "Neela: No! This isn't your fault. Your mother was trying to protect you because she loved you. She wouldn't want you to be like this. And you shouldn't have to. I... I lied to you earlier.", "Shane: About what?", "Neela: This.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Cell phone rings]", "Aubrey: Rex?", "Cutter: No, it's me.", "Aubrey: If you're calling to wish me \"merry Christmas,\" I'm not interested.", "Cutter: No, wait. Aubrey --", "Aubrey: What?", "Cutter: Don't hang up. I've got one phone call, and you're the only person I could think of. I need your help.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Static]", "Rex: [Clears throat]", "Stacy: Just give him a chance.", "Rex: To do what?", "Prof. Fina: Patience, young man. I just need to, uh... recalibrate. Uh-huh.", "Stacy: [Gasps] Oh, my God. Oh, I look just like -- I mean, I've seen the pictures, but that's amazing. I mean... can we hear it?", "Prof. Fina: Oh, of course. Just as long as the frequency cooperates.", "[Beeping]", "Gigi: Get to the courthouse and tell Shane that I'm on my way. I will be there soon. I just have a quick errand I have to run first.", "Roxanne: Oh, no errands for you. That's what a maid of honor is good for.", "Rex: That errand -- that's what got her killed.", "Gigi: I've still got plenty of time, and this won't take long. I swear.", "Roxanne: Okay. I just want you to know, I'm so glad that you and Rex are gonna have your happily ever after.", "Gigi: Me too.", "[Door closes]", "Stacy: What was it that she put in her purse?", "Rex: A tape recorder. That's what they found on her.", "Rex: No, I'm okay.", "Stacy: We have to follow her. Can we do that?", "Prof. Fina: Yes, well, the, uh, the space-time navigator should take us into the basement, I think. I actually don't know why it hasn't already.", "[Beeping]", "Stacy: Oh, my God. Is that me?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8sRZPLOQg"}
