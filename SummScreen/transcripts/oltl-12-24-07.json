        "Jessica: Don't pretend you don't know me, Nash. It's Tess.",
        "Nash: Jessica, cut it out.",
        "Jessica: What kind of welcome home is that? I have missed you. I am here to make all of your dreams come true. Jessica didn't know what to put in your stocking, so I thought I'd bring you home me. Merry Christmas.",

        "Jared: You slept with your ex?",
        "Natalie: Last night.",
        "Jared: And you're telling me this why?",
        "Natalie: Because it proves that we're done.",
        "Jared: How we feel about each other is no longer an issue because you had ex sex?",
        "Natalie: I had ex sex because I have moved on, Uncle Jared.",

        "Blair: You and Rex are going to jail!",
        "Addie: Well, I guess it's true what they say. A party isn't a party until something gets broken. Merry Christmas, girls. So, who wants to kiss me first?",
        "Blair: Mama? Is that -- is -- is that really her?",
        "Addie: Of course, it's me. Come here, honey.",
        "Blair: Oh, Mama.",

        "Starr: Grandma --",
        "Addie: My little Starr -- did you think I'd forgotten you? Never, never, never. You're so lovely, and so grown-up.",

        "Dorian: The newest member of our family. My foster daughter, Langston.",
        "Addie: Langston -- what a fabulous name.",
        "Langston: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Mama, why -- why don't you sit down, okay?",
        "Addie: Because I don't want to. I'm -- I've been sitting down for 40 years. I'm through with sitting down. It's Christmas Eve, and I am proposing a toast. To a brand-new me!",

        "Gigi: I need to tell you something.",
        "Rex: What? My God. That ring -- you married?",

        "Viki: Oh, my. Oh, my, my, my.",
        "Charlie: What?",
        "Viki: This is kind of silly. It -- it's -- it's been a while for me, and I -- I was kind of wondering, you know, whether I would still feel -- and -- well, I did. I mean, I -- I do. Um -- oh, dear.",
        "[Viki giggles]",
        "Charlie: Well, it's sort of like riding a bicycle.",

        "Gigi: Um -- I'm just doing this friend of mine a favor. She's divorced and she needs the money, and she couldn't bring herself to, you know, haggle with the guy, so she asked me to do it.",
        "Rex: How -- how much -- how much does she want for it?",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry?",
        "Rex: The ring -- how much?",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Rex: Because I'm in the market, and if it's not too pricey, I might be able to take it off your hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I thought you told me your grandmother was, you know, out of the ballgame.",

        "Langston: So then what happened?",
        "Starr: I honestly don't know.",
        "Adriana: Addie, where did you get all this stuff?",
        "Addie: The internet. You just go online and they have all these wonderful pictures of wonderful things, and you click-click, and -- and they send them to you -- wrapped.",
        "Blair: Mama, you look wonderful. It's just we're so surprised.",
        "Addie: Well, good! What's Christmas without a few surprises?",
        "Dorian: I'm calling St. Ann's.",
        "Addie: Don't touch that phone! Those days are over. I'm myself -- whatever that is. Aren't you happy for me?",
        "Blair: Oh, Mama, of course. We're very, very happy for you. It's just I think we're -- we're a little shocked that the doctors didn't tell us how well you were doing.",
        "Addie: It's because I told them to keep their trap shut. I wanted you to take one look at me and just know.",
        "Dorian: We are thrilled. It -- it's, you know, it is a -- a big change, and I guess we just don't know what to make of it.",
        "Addie: And you'd feel more comfortable talking to my doctor than to me?",
        "Dorian: Yes, that's a wonderful idea. I'm going to call Dr. Bonner now.",
        "Addie: He's right here. Eddie? Dr. Edward Bonner, my miracle man.",
        "Edward: In cases like these, ordinarily, I do like to prepare the family first, but Addie insisted on surprising you all.",
        "Dorian: Prepare us? For what?",
        "Edward: For your sister's transformation.",
        "Dorian: Yes. It is a big difference, Dr. Bonner.",

        "Natalie: Funny. It was John.",

        "Natalie: Where all we did was sleep.",
        "Jared: Hmm. Your loss.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry -- um -- I didn't -- I didn't quite hear that, Uncle Jared.",
        "Jared: So you and John --",
        "Natalie: We had a few drinks, went back to his room, and had sex.",
        "Jared: You were drunk.",
        "Natalie: I had a few shots. I wouldn't say I was drunk.",
        "Jared: So what'd you tell him?",
        "Natalie: What do you mean?",
        "Jared: Well, I mean, since you were both stone-cold sober, he must have wondered, being an ex, why you suddenly had your tongue down his throat.",
        "Natalie: The point is that --",
        "Jared: That you slept with another man because you were so broken up about not being able to have me that you had to drown your sorrows in somebody else.",
        "Natalie: This conversation I over.",
        "Jared: But you can't run away from me. It doesn't matter how much tequila you shoot, or how many men you drudge up from your past. This is real, and I am not letting go of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Jessica: Admit it. You missed me. Well, Jessica's nice, but -- if you like nice.",
        "Nash: I'm calling the doctor.",
        "Jessica: Yes, yes! I fooled you! You totally thought I was Tess!",

        "Nash: Why? Why would you want to be Tess?",
        "Jessica: So I can fool Jared.",
        "Nash: Whoa! Ah!",
        "Jessica: Well, you saw what he did to Natalie. He totally broke her heart, and it's -- it's my fault. I brought Jared to town.",
        "Nash: No, it's not your fault, it is Tess' fault.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well, then Tess can fix it. She fooled him once, she can fool him again.",
        "Nash: That's great, that's great. That's fantastic. Jared now -- and what about us? Have you thought about us? Have you thought about what it would do to you and to me to have Tess running around loose again?",
        "Nash: I love you. You are my wife. You are the mother of my child, and we have a happy and a healthy life together. I'm not willing to jeopardize that, not for all the Jareds in the world.",
        "Jessica: We are not going to jeopardize it.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Jessica: I am healthy now, I am integrated. Tess is a part of me, but she's also a role I can play, a role that I can use to get to Jared.",
        "Nash: How? How is Tess going to get to Jared, huh?",
        "Jessica: How do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Don't touch me. It's not fair.",
        "Jared: You're right. I'm sorry. I -- I'm just concerned. I know how you get when you're upset, and the thought of you drowning your sorrows in meaningless sex, it's --",
        "Natalie: Oh, please. Get over yourself. And who said it was meaningless?",
        "Jared: What are you saying?",
        "Natalie: Not that it's any of your business, Uncle Jared, but John and I were together for a very long time, and we're friends. We care about each other, and we have never had meaningless sex, and we never will. We know each other very well. We're very close.",
        "Jared: I get it.",
        "Natalie: No, you don't get it, because you and I have never had that, and we never will.",
        "Jared: So you and John are --",
        "Natalie: See ya.",
        "Jared: Natalie, are you going back to him?",

        "Addie: Is there rum in it? The sisters wouldn't let us have hard cider.",
        "Dorian: Dr. Bonner -- what is going on here, and why was I the last to know?",
        "Edward: As a matter of fact, you and I have discussed this, and when we spoke a while ago, you gave me permission to try a new medication.",
        "Blair: Wait -- you're saying this is all because of a little pill?",
        "Dorian: None of the literature that you gave me described personality changes as drastic as this one. I mean, this is extreme. My sister has been in mental institutions ever since she was Starr's age. Even younger.",
        "Addie: Mmm. Heavenly.",
        "Langston: You look happy.",

        "Blair: Oh, you've given her her life back. She's back in the world again.",
        "Dorian: For how long, Blair? She's been at peace for years, and now, she's on some sort of psychotropic seesaw.",
        "Blair: Oh, what would you want? I mean, if you were given the choice, would you rather be in St. Ann's making potholders, or would you rather be here in your home, surrounded by your family that loves you?",

And you pretending that we can -- that we're more than friends, less than lovers -- it's not helping. The fact remains, you are my uncle, I am your niece. That is reality.
