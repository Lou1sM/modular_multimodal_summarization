        "Blair is upset. Todd can see that she blames him for losing her baby. He leaves the room and Evangeline is there to help him when he starts feeling down. He calls Viki to come to the hospital. Rex and Adriana are on Dorian's living room floor making love. Rex wants to get up and get dressed before the dragon lady returns but Adriana wants more of him. He can't resist and they are at it like rabbits again before the fireplace. Dorian was out at Viki initially thanking her for helping to get Adriana to come around, but now she has returned to her home and she hears raucous laughter in her house. She flies through the door. \"Adriana! What is going on?\" Adriana and Rex are on the couch dressed and snuggling but that is all. \"What did you expect?\" Adriana asks sarcastically. \"Did you think that we would be making love on the living room floor?\" Dorian says that she has been thinking that they should go and see Blair She tries to dismiss Rex from the house but Adriana will not allow it and they all go to the hospital to see Blair. When Todd tries to go into the room, Dorian shouts at him to get out. He won't go though unless Blair tells him to. \"Please leave,\" Blair says quietly. \"I want to be alone with my family.\" Those words sting and Todd leaves the room quickly. Bo goes to talk to Spencer to see what his story is about the roof incident. \"Well, I was tied up, Todd was torturing me he was talking on the phone and that is when he found out about the baby. He thought that it was mine and he snapped! He got Blair over there and then pushed the both of us off the roof,\" Spencer says. Bo doesn't believe him but Spencer knows that there is no way that Bo can prove anything different. Bo meets with Rex in the hall of the hospital. Rex heard about Blair losing the baby and he asks if there are any leads in the case. Bo says that unfortunately, everything that he digs up in this investigation makes Todd look guiltier and guiltier. Marty talks to Evangeline and crosses the line when she accuses Marty of not taking the case with Spencer personal enough. She tells how she was there when Todd flatlined and thought that he was going to be killed on death row. Marty gets offended when it appears that Evangeline has forgotten that she has been raped by Todd and has had to do her job and push her feelings aside. Evangeline apologizes for being insensitive. She tells that John is in the hospital right now and they need to get this case finished before John gets out. She gets a call to go and see John and assess him for release. Marty refuses to release John and he has no idea who he was just talking to."

        "Marty: What's so funny?",
        "John: Eh -- that word, \"feelings.\"",
        "Marty: What about it?",
        "John: Nothing. Forget about it.",
        "Marty: Oh, let me guess. You don't do feelings. You do facts and clues and theories and you take action, but you have no use for feelings.",
        "John: I'm feeling something right now.",
        "Marty: Are you always this antagonistic?",
        "John: Actually, I'm really charming once you get to know me.",
        "Marty: I can't imagine why anyone would bother.",
        "John: So you see? It works out for everyone, then. But enough about me. You know, it must take a lot of imagination to tell someone they're nuts, right?",
        "Marty: Yeah. The same way it takes a lot of imagination to tell someone they're guilty.",
        "John: You don't know what I've seen. You sure as hell haven't seen what these monsters do to their victims. Women, children. Let me tell you something about guilt, lady. Huh -- you were close.",
        "Marty: Close?",
        "John: Provocation. I get it. You know, I lose it, and then you whip out your -- your little tape recorder, and then you start analyzing me. It's a cute trick.",
        "Marty: I'm not trying to trick you.",
        "John: Good. It wouldn't work.",
        "Marty: Ok. Then what will? You don't like my questions, and you won't give me answers.",
        "John: My discharge papers will do just fine.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry, those I can't give you.",
        "John: Can't, or won't?",
        "Marty: Both.",
        "John: Well, why didn't you say so? Get the hell out of my room.",
        "Marty: Ok. I'll go. But just answer me this first. How long were you in therapy before?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh. Thank goodness. I mean, what a relief that you're not --",
        "Adriana: Having sex on your living room floor? Why would you think that, mom?",
        "Dorian: I, you know, heard --",
        "Rex: Oh, now, don't be so hard on her, duchess. I mean, we did briefly consider strip poker.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. We found stuff to do. I thought you wanted to go see Blair at the hospital.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I do. I do. In fact, let me gather up her presents, and then we'll be on our way. Speaking of which -- Rex, you can show yourself out, can't you?",
        "Adriana: Rex is coming with us, mom. And you know what? Besides, I don't think Blair's really going to be in the mood for presents.",
        "Dorian: You're right. This probably is not the time for it. I've already gotten the most perfect gift I could have asked for, though. Having you come back.",
        "Adriana: Well, it's Christmas, and you're my mom. But I still don't trust you.",
        "Dorian: I know. But I've learned my lesson, Adriana. I swear.",
        "Rex: Great! Then it's settled. Now, how about we all get to the hospital already?",
        "Adriana: Good idea. We'll take Rex's car. We'll see you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I'm so sorry.",
        "Viki: Todd -- what happened?",
        "Evangeline: It's Blair.",
        "Viki: Well, no, she's not --",
        "Evangeline: No, she's fine.",
        "Viki: What's wrong?",
        "Todd: The baby --",
        "Viki: Oh, no --",
        "Todd: He was our little boy.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God.",
        "Todd: My little son. My son, he's gone now. Uh-uh. Just, he's gone.",
        "Evangeline: Let's -- let's get him --",
        "Todd: Ahem.",
        "Evangeline: Todd, if you need anything at all from me, please call. Ok?",
        "Viki: Oh, honey. It's ok. It's ok. I love you. I love you.",
        "Todd: I just -- I was just trying to find my -- my son. I -- I didn't know I had another one. Everything goes wrong with me, Viki. I'm just -- I think I'm cursed.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Todd: I think I'm cursed.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Todd: I think I'm always going to be cursed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No, no, no, no. You're calling me a slut? You were his one-night stand, and trust me, that's not going to happen again.",
        "Dorian: Did Clint say that?",
        "Viki: No, Clint didn't say anything because Clint is a gentleman.",
        "Dorian: Everybody knows that you will be mourning Ben until the end of time, and yet you will not let go of Clint. You keep trying to sink your claws into him. Why? Can you not bear to be alone?",
        "Viki: I would kill to be alone right now.",
        "Dorian: Deny it.",
        "Viki: Deny what? That I will always love Ben? Of course I will. It doesn't mean I'm going to spend the rest of my life in mourning, for heaven sakes. Sooner or later, hopefully, I will fall in love again.",
        "Dorian: With Clint.",
        "Viki: With someone special.",
        "Dorian: And since Clint is so very, very special, obviously he's going to remain on your list. Viki, for goodness sakes, face it. Clint is fond of you, of course, because you are the mother of his children. But he doesn't feel passionate about you. He is not in love with you.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Dorian: Yes, really.",
        "Viki: So why are you here? Let me tell you something. Whether or not I want Clint for myself, I am going to fight so damned hard to make sure he does not wind up with you. And believe me, I have much better ammunition than you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We're talking about Truman, right?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, yeah, that's what we were talking about.",
        "Bo: Ok. Well, then what's the latest? Is he faking this insanity?",
        "Marty: You know I can't break confidentiality, Bo.",
        "Bo: Well, no, of course. But if your diagnosis changes before we have a chance to move Truman to Wingdale --",
        "Evangeline: Then you're obligated to inform the court.",
        "Marty: Yes. I know my job, thank you. Look, the only thing I can tell you is that Spencer isn't changing his story about what happened in the warehouse or on the roof. He's saying that Todd is responsible for all of it.",
        "Bo: Well, jeez, I'm not surprised. Do you believe him?",
        "Marty: Doesn't really matter what I believe.",
        "Bo: No, I guess it doesn't. I mean, it's Truman's word against Manning's.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I believe Todd.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, I'd like to believe Todd. But he hates Truman, I think -- for good reason. I think we all know where Truman stands. My gut feeling is that the truth lies somewhere between their two accounts. Can I go in there and talk to him?",
        "Marty: Could I stop you?",
        "Bo: No, what I mean is, is he lucid enough to answer questions right now?",
        "Marty: I'm sorry. Yes, for now.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So there's proof that -- that Manning hijacked the transport?",
        "Michael: Well, who else could've pulled this off? And they found Spencer in the same warehouse where Spencer delivered Todd and Margaret's baby.",
        "John: I don't know, Michael. This sounds pretty circumstantial to me.",
        "Michael: Are you on Manning's side?",
        "John: No. But the way I see it, the only mistake Manning made was he didn't kill him. I know I would've.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hmm. I thought you Buchanans always hunted in packs. If you've come to beg my forgiveness, my mercy, forget about it. Your old man's going to pay for what he did to my mother, period.",
        "Bo: I think you got the message about my family loud and clear, so I'm not here to talk about that. I want to know what happened in the warehouse.",
        "Spencer: It's simple -- Todd Manning tried to kill me and Blair.",
        "Bo: So now you're accusing Manning of trying to kill Blair?",
        "Spencer: That's right. Of course he did, and the reason is obvious. He thought she was pregnant with my child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Why couldn't they just let me die?",
        "Todd: Blair --",
        "Blair: Why couldn't they just save our baby instead?",
        "Todd: Well, they couldn't -- they couldn't save him. He was 17 weeks.",
        "Blair: So our baby --",
        "Todd: None of this would've happened if I hadn't --",
        "Todd: God, if I'd just -- it just happened so quick, I couldn't think. I couldn't think. And then you went over.",
        "Blair: It wasn't just me. Three people -- three people fell, the most important one died.",
        "Todd: No, you're alive.",
        "Blair: No. Our baby died, Todd!",
        "Todd: Why don't you say it? Please. It was my fault. Say it, Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Oh -- oh, amazing, amazing, amazing.",
        "Adriana: Oh, amazing. Happy holidays. Hmm.",
        "Rex: All right, we better get dressed before Dorian gets back.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Rex: What are you doing?",
        "Adriana: Weighing my options.",
        "Rex: What options? She's going to be back any second.",
        "Adriana: I know. That's what makes this so hot.",
        "Rex: Again? Now?",
        "Adriana: You're not up for it?",
        "Rex: I'm up for it.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Better ammunition, or you just going to play dirty?",
        "Viki: Oh, for heaven sakes, Dorian, Clint and I have a history, we have a family. Do you seriously think your stupid handful of dates is going to trump what we have -- a life?",
        "Dorian: Oh, I do not need to trump anything. If Clint wanted to be with you, he would be with you.",
        "Viki: You are so frighteningly shallow.",
        "Dorian: And you are so frighteningly predictable. Yes. Why do you think Clint keeps coming after me time and time again? Because I am unpredictable, I am mysterious, and, therefore, irresistible.",
        "Viki: Oh, you are mysterious. It's all your lies, Dorian -- lie upon lie upon lie -- and Clint sees that, and it ain't sexy, honey.",
        "Dorian: \"It ain't sexy, honey\"? Please. Is that Victoria speaking, or is it perhaps one of your alters trying to come out?",
        "Viki: Well, if it is, maybe you'd better leave -- before jean tries to lock you up again or Tommy tries to kill you!",
        "Dorian: You want Clint.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Dorian: You have designs upon him. Huh -- but I doubt he reciprocates.",
        "Viki: Really? Did I forget to show you the Christmas gift he gave me? Oh, how rude of me. Isn't it gorgeous?",
        "Dorian: Clint has perfect taste.",
        "Viki: Yes, he does. What was it, again, he gave you?",
        "Dorian: I have not had the chance to celebrate Christmas with anyone, really, because Blair is in the hospital.",
        "Viki: I was very sorry to hear about Blair, but I spoke to Bo and I understand she's pulling through very nicely.",
        "Dorian: Yes, because she's a fighter. But everything that has happened to her, your brother, Todd, is responsible for. I only pray that this time she will realize that she's better off without him.",
        "Viki: And I am on my knees praying that Clint has learned he is so much better off without you.",
        "Dorian: So this is war?",
        "Viki: Whatever. Just as long as you leave.",
        "Dorian: Ho-ho-ho-ho!",
        "Viki: Whew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So, what you're telling me here is that you're willing to throw away your future, you're willing to throw away your relationship with Natalie, all so you can go after Spencer Truman?",
        "John: You know, people are always telling me I refused to have a life until I brought dad's killer in.",
        "Michael: And you did.",
        "John: Well, it hasn't really happened yet, Mike, so yeah, I'm going after him.",
        "Michael: Ok. So you go after Spencer Truman and Natalie follows you and you don't know about it, and what if it's her that falls off the roof this time and not Blair? What are you going to do then?",
        "John: Oh, this is the shrink's fault.",
        "Michael: You know, you're right. This is all about Dr. Saybrooke. I don't know how she fell for that crazy act -- I mean, that was pathetic.",
        "John: It's a job, Mike -- tell you you're nuts and then send you a bill.",
        "Michael: Oh. I got to go. I'm on-duty. You know, I just -- I just thought that it should be me that told you about Blair's miscarriage.",
        "John: I appreciate that, Mike. I do.",
        "Michael: Take your meds.",
        "John: Yeah, ok. Hey, look -- if you see Manning, you tell him -- eh. Just tell him I'm getting out of here soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: No. I wouldn't want someone who was insane to be tried and convicted and dropped in the prison system -- of course not. But would you want a man who is obviously sane enough to manipulate his psychiatrist and the entire legal process just spending out his years in some white-glove mental institution as opposed to paying for his crimes?",
        "Marty: Hypothetically, no, of course not. And even if that were what Spencer was doing -- and I don't believe it is -- his fate isn't up to me.",
        "Evangeline: Why? Because he's going to Wingdale?",
        "Marty: You know, contrary to what everybody thinks, it's not a country club. It's an institution for the criminally insane.",
        "Evangeline: Yes. And until he gets there, his diagnosis is your responsibility.",
        "Marty: Yes, and I'm sticking by it. I'm a professional just like you.",
        "Evangeline: And just like me, you're a human being, Marty. And no matter how professional we try to be, sometimes things get personal. I was there when Todd flatlined in that execution chamber. That's going to haunt me for the rest of my life, so this isn't just a case for me, it's personal. And I can't imagine that it's not personal for you because -- because I can't imagine how I would feel towards the man --",
        "Marty: Who raped you? Hmm. You know, you say you watched Todd die. And after what he did to me, that's all I wanted to do. And I have to live with what he did to me for the rest of my life. But I'm really getting sick of people believing that I would use that, that I would use what happened to me to perjure myself on the stand.",
        "Evangeline: I apologize.",
        "Marty: Apology accepted. And I appreciate your honesty. You're obviously passionate where Todd is concerned.",
        "Evangeline: Oh -- no, it's not just Todd. I really want Spencer to pay for everybody that he's hurt, and that includes John and Michael. If you knew them --",
        "Marty: No, I know of them and I heard what happened to detective Mc Bain and about the crash.",
        "Evangeline: He's got a long recovery ahead of him.",
        "Marty: Is -- is he in -- in this hospital?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. They transferred him here this morning. And I thank God every day for bringing John back to us. And I'm going to do everything in my power, Marty, to get the Spencer case back into court before John gets out of the hospital.",
        "Marty: Why is that? Is that for detective Mc Bain or for Dr. Truman?",
        "Evangeline: I just want all this to be over. Excuse me.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Marty: Oh, huh. Dr. Saybrooke. Oh -- Dr. Rice, hi. No, no. I am not taking on any more cases right now. Oh. Uh -- Detective Mc Bain. That's funny -- we were just talking about him. Yeah. I will talk to him. Ok. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: There's no way Manning knew Blair was pregnant.",
        "Spencer: Says who?",
        "Bo: She had just found out herself.",
        "Spencer: Oh. While I was tied up in that room, while Manning was torturing me, he was having a nice chat with Blair on his cell phone. Do you think he couldn't have told her then?",
        "Bo: So you didn't hear her tell him?",
        "Spencer: No, it doesn't matter. Look at -- look at the man's actions. Doesn't that prove anything to you? He hijacks an armed transport, kidnaps me, tortures me, was planning on killing me the entire time? Finds out Blair's pregnant and just snaps? Uses me to lure Blair to that rooftop and shoves us both off, man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I did this. I killed our baby. I nearly killed you. I am a selfish -- and you were sick and scared. And I should've been there instead of --",
        "Blair: Just -- just go, Todd. I want to be alone.",
        "Viki: Todd, how's Blair doing? Todd? What's wrong? What's happened?",
        "Todd: I don't know -- she's the same.",
        "Viki: So what's wrong?",
        "Todd: Uh -- can you just -- can you come down to the hospital?",
        "Viki: Sure, hon. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh. Adriana, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You here about my discharge?",
        "Marty: Mind if I come in?",
        "John: It depends -- who are you? You know, if you're insurance, I'm probably not fully covered, so you should throw me out of here now.",
        "Marty: No, I'm not with the insurance company, I can assure you.",
        "John: Ah. So they sent me a shrink.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I'm a psychiatrist. I consult here at Llanview hospital.",
        "John: Michael.",
        "Marty: Ok.",
        "John: Do I have a choice?",
        "Marty: We all have choices.",
        "John: Ah, you get right to it. Have a seat.",
        "Marty: Ok. Detective Mc Bain --",
        "John: Just tell me what you need to know to get me the hell out of here.",
        "Marty: I can do that. I need you to tell me what you feel about all of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Aren't you going to say anything, Commissioner?",
        "Bo: Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate -- all steady.",
        "Spencer: Well, I appreciate the concern, Commissioner, but you're not the doctor here.",
        "Bo: I'm not -- I don't give a damn about your health, Truman. What I want is the truth. Now, all these monitors that you're hooked up to here -- what they are, they're ad hoc lie detectors, and what they're telling me is that your meltdown that you had just now? It's a load of bull.",
        "Spencer: Lie detection, commissioner? It's voodoo science, man. You know that.",
        "Bo: Spoken like a sane man.",
        "Spencer: Oh, I never said I was crazy. My psychiatrist did.",
        "Bo: Yeah. She played right into your hands.",
        "Spencer: Are you suggesting that somehow I manipulated her to testify the way she did?",
        "Bo: I'm suggesting that you're afraid of the needle.",
        "Spencer: I'm a world-renowned surgeon, commissioner. I will prove my sanity and my innocence, and Todd Manning is going back to death row for killing his unborn child and attempting to kill Blair and me.",
        "Bo: I think Marty may be right. I think maybe you are insane.",
        "Spencer: I can tell you this -- I was on that rooftop last night. So was Todd Manning, and I dare you, I dare you to prove that anything that I'm saying isn't true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Hey. How are you? You told her?",
        "Todd: I don't know what's going to happen now.",
        "Evangeline: You're going to make it through this, ok? I promise, I promise you will.",
        "Todd: Where are my kids?",
        "Evangeline: Marcie stopped by. She took them home with her and she's going to take good care of them.",
        "Todd: Ok.",
        "Evangeline: How is she?",
        "Todd: Everyone I care about, Evangeline -- everyone who's important to me, innocent people -- I just hurt them. Why am I like this? Why am I like this? Ah! Ah!",
        "Evangeline: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What's so funny?",
        "John: Eh -- that word, \"feelings.\"",
        "Marty: What about it?",
        "John: Nothing. Forget about it.",
        "Marty: Oh, let me guess. You don't do feelings. You do facts and clues and theories and you take action, but you have no use for feelings.",
        "John: I'm feeling something right now.",
        "Marty: Are you always this antagonistic?",
        "John: Actually, I'm really charming once you get to know me.",
        "Marty: I can't imagine why anyone would bother.",
        "John: So you see? It works out for everyone, then. But enough about me. You know, it must take a lot of imagination to tell someone they're nuts, right?",
        "Marty: Yeah. The same way it takes a lot of imagination to tell someone they're guilty.",
        "John: You don't know what I've seen. You sure as hell haven't seen what these monsters do to their victims. Women, children. Let me tell you something about guilt, lady. Huh -- you were close.",
        "Marty: Close?",
        "John: Provocation. I get it. You know, I lose it, and then you whip out your -- your little tape recorder, and then you start analyzing me. It's a cute trick.",
        "Marty: I'm not trying to trick you.",
        "John: Good. It wouldn't work.",
        "Marty: Ok. Then what will? You don't like my questions, and you won't give me answers.",
        "John: My discharge papers will do just fine.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry, those I can't give you.",
        "John: Can't, or won't?",
        "Marty: Both.",
        "John: Well, why didn't you say so? Get the hell out of my room.",
        "Marty: Ok. I'll go. But just answer me this first. How long were you in therapy before?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh. Thank goodness. I mean, what a relief that you're not --",
        "Adriana: Having sex on your living room floor? Why would you think that, mom?",
        "Dorian: I, you know, heard --",
        "Rex: Oh, now, don't be so hard on her, duchess. I mean, we did briefly consider strip poker.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. We found stuff to do. I thought you wanted to go see Blair at the hospital.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I do. I do. In fact, let me gather up her presents, and then we'll be on our way. Speaking of which -- Rex, you can show yourself out, can't you?",
        "Adriana: Rex is coming with us, mom. And you know what? Besides, I don't think Blair's really going to be in the mood for presents.",
        "Dorian: You're right. This probably is not the time for it. I've already gotten the most perfect gift I could have asked for, though. Having you come back.",
        "Adriana: Well, it's Christmas, and you're my mom. But I still don't trust you.",
        "Dorian: I know. But I've learned my lesson, Adriana. I swear.",
        "Rex: Great! Then it's settled. Now, how about we all get to the hospital already?",
        "Adriana: Good idea. We'll take Rex's car. We'll see you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I'm so sorry.",
        "Viki: Todd -- what happened?",
        "Evangeline: It's Blair.",
        "Viki: Well, no, she's not --",
        "Evangeline: No, she's fine.",
        "Viki: What's wrong?",
        "Todd: The baby --",
        "Viki: Oh, no --",
        "Todd: He was our little boy.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God.",
        "Todd: My little son. My son, he's gone now. Uh-uh. Just, he's gone.",
        "Evangeline: Let's -- let's get him --",
        "Todd: Ahem.",
        "Evangeline: Todd, if you need anything at all from me, please call. Ok?",
        "Viki: Oh, honey. It's ok. It's ok. I love you. I love you.",
        "Todd: I just -- I was just trying to find my -- my son. I -- I didn't know I had another one. Everything goes wrong with me, Viki. I'm just -- I think I'm cursed.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Todd: I think I'm cursed.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Todd: I think I'm always going to be cursed.",
        "Viki: No, no, no, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Is that what it says on my chart there? That I had to see a doctor because of an incident at work?",
        "Marty: I haven't seen your chart. But it's obvious you've seen a therapist. You know quite a lot about the process.",
        "John: Well, I know what a joke it is.",
        "Marty: Did this work-related incident involve violence?",
        "John: And why should I talk to you about this?",
        "Marty: Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, don't.",
        "John: I shot someone in the line of duty.",
        "Marty: Are you prone to violence?",
        "John: Only when people piss me off.",
        "Marty: Are you always this defensive, John? I mean, we're just having a conversation.",
        "John: Lady, I barely talk to people I like.",
        "Marty: Ah. You're tough.",
        "John: I was trained in interrogation. Next?",
        "Marty: What are you afraid of?",
        "John: Snakes, and not getting out of here fast enough.",
        "Marty: Why is that important to you?",
        "John: Well, I was bit once, and I got things to do on the outside.",
        "Marty: You're recovering from major surgery.",
        "John: Then again, the food's lousy and the company's worse.",
        "Marty: Huh -- well, there is that, isn't there?",
        "John: Yeah. Let's cut to the chase. I know the drill, all right? You know, I say something, you agree with me, and then you go in for the kill after I've loosened up.",
        "Marty: Is that what your last therapist did?",
        "John: You're easier on the eyes than he was, but the script's the same.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "John: \"How are you feeling, John?\" \"Ok.\" \"Were you traumatized?\" \"No.\" \"Are you going to kill yourself?\" \"Not over some scars and less chest hair.\" There, you happy?",
        "Marty: Not really. Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, my God, what is it? Has Blair taken a turn for the worse?",
        "Viki: No, no. No. Blair's condition is the same. Oh, lord, I'm so sorry to have to tell you this. The baby didn't make it. He died.",
        "Adriana: This is awful. Todd thinks that both his sons are dead. And yet, we know that Michael and Marcie adopted his other son.",
        "Rex: Adriana, please -- not now.",
        "Adriana: Ok, you're right.",
        "Dorian: How long have you known this?",
        "Viki: Todd just told me.",
        "Todd: I didn't want anyone to know before Blair knew.",
        "Dorian: You told Blair? In her condition?",
        "Todd: She asked!",
        "Dorian: I want to go in and see her, right now. Adriana, would you come with me, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Do you want me to stay?",
        "Adriana: No, it's ok. I'll call you later, ok?",
        "Rex: Ok.",
        "Blair: Go away.",
        "Dorian: Sweetheart, it's Dorian, and I'm here with Adriana. We heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey.",
        "Bo: Balsom -- you look terrible.",
        "Rex: Well, I just came from seeing Blair.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. Man -- gee, that poor family -- I don't see how much more grief they can deal with.",
        "Rex: That investigation turning up anything new?",
        "Bo: Bit by bit. The more my people dig up, the more it looks like Manning's guilty of everything he's accused of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Holy mackerel. That's a nice outfit, counselor. I can't believe they let you walk around the hospital wearing that thing.",
        "Evangeline: Shut up, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: You're going to give somebody a heart attack.",
        "Evangeline: Shut up. I'm not here to watch you play crazy I'm here to tell you how this is going to end.",
        "Spencer: -- Ahem -- If you are here trying to scare me into making a confession, counselor, you're wasting your time.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, you're not scared yet -- but you will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: No, I am not happy. I want to go home. I'm in the middle of the biggest case of my life. And I want to solve it while I still can.",
        "Marty: I think we should talk about it.",
        "John: No.",
        "Marty: Can you at least admit that it's important to you?",
        "John: Ok, I admit it.",
        "Marty: Ok, why?",
        "John: Huh.",
        "Nurse: Time to change your dressings.",
        "John: I'll have the balsamic vinaigrette.",
        "Marty: Well, I guess I should go. Maybe we could talk again sometime.",
        "John: There's no lock on the door. But don't expect any more than you got today.",
        "Marty: Hmm. People really think you're charming? Yeah, it must be an acquired taste.",
        "John: Hey, let me ask you something. What are my chances of getting out of here if the psychiatrist won't even give me the thumbs-up?",
        "Nurse: No chance at all. Once they call in a psych consult, you're not going anywhere till you pass muster.",
        "John: You know the name of that shrink?",
        "Nurse: Never seen her before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: You've been really lucky. Oh, really lucky surviving that fall. But your luck's going to run out. And when it does, I'm going to do to you what Hugh would have wanted.",
        "Spencer: Don't talk about my son, counselor.",
        "Evangeline: You're going to pay -- for what you did to Todd, for what you did to his baby, for what you did to Blair and her unborn child, for what you did to David and John and Michael -- and everybody else that you hurt in this town, Spencer. And even if the system doesn't get you, God help you. Because somebody else will. And that person will deserve a medal.",
        "Spencer: I'm not worried.",
        "Evangeline: Good. Then you won't see it coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Todd just lost a kid, and Blair almost died. Are you really going to arrest him now?",
        "Bo: No, not right now. Of course not. But, you know, if Manning did push Truman off that roof, he could end up back in prison.",
        "Rex: But it's Todd's word against Spencer's.",
        "Bo: No, but there's Blair, too.",
        "Rex: Blair would never rat out Todd.",
        "Bo: She might if she thought that by going after Truman, Manning caused her baby's death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Go to her, Todd. She needs you, no matter what she's feeling. You're both suffering. You can help each other get through this, but don't let it drive you apart. Go.",
        "Dorian: Leave us alone this minute!",
        "Todd: That's up to Blair.",
        "Blair: I want to be alone with my family.",
        "Viki: She needs time, that's all.",
        "Todd: Yeah, to hate me even more."
