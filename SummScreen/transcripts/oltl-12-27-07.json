        "Cristian: Evangeline, it's me, Cristian. I'm sorry I haven't been by to visit. I wanted to, but -- doesn't matter. I'm here now. I've missed you so much. I didn't realize until I couldn't talk to you or see you how much you helped me, how much I need you -- especially now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Hello? Anybody here?",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Sarah: Antonio, hey. Place looks great.",
        "Antonio: Thank you.",
        "Sarah: So, is Cristian around?",
        "Antonio: No, he actually -- he left me a voicemail this morning, said he had to go out of town.",
        "Sarah: To see Evangeline?",
        "Antonio: Uh -- I don't know. He just -- he said he wasn't going to be able to make it tonight, so I'm managing the big bash.",
        "Sarah: Ooh, the big boss has to work on New Year's, huh?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess it's -- it's better than sitting at home thinking about what a mess I made of 2007.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: It's true?",
        "Talia: Yes, it's true. After today, I'll be out of here, and I'm transferring to Cherryville.",
        "Dorian: We have to go straight in and see Bo, have him put out an APB immediately.",
        "Talia: Hey, whoa, whoa, ladies! The commissioner's not here right now.",
        "Dorian: Well, call him in, because we have an emergency.",
        "Blair: It's about my mother -- she's disappeared.",
        "Talia: Your mom? Isn't she in St. Ann's?",
        "Blair: Well, she's cured.",
        "Dorian: Supposedly.",
        "Blair: The point is --",
        "Dorian: She's vanished completely and she has to be found before she meets up with something terrible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, good -- I picked this up in the lobby. You sending away again?",
        "John: I've been trying to call you; your phone's been off all morning.",
        "Michael: I was in court -- my hearing was today.",
        "John: Why didn't you say something?",
        "Michael: Everything's okay. I pled guilty to the perjury and bail-jumping charges, judge took pity and gave me a year's probation.",
        "John: So you got the all-clear?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Now I can get back on the road to find Tommy and Marcie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You --",
        "Marcie: What's up?",
        "Gigi: Are probably going to faint when you see this.",
        "Marcie: Oh, my God, what is that?",
        "Gigi: Do I work fast, or what?",
        "Marcie: You sold it. You sold my engagement ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I never want to be away from you again -- not for a day, an hour, or a minute. Adriana, will you marry me?",
        "Adriana: Wow, this is just -- I -- I didn't know you were going to do this. It's just so --",
        "Rex: It -- it can be a long engagement. Or -- or you -- you can just wear the ring and still be my girlfriend. Or I can just crawl into a hole and die.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, I thought I was doing what you wanted me to do.",
        "Marcie: No, you did. I mean, you did, you know, and I -- I can't think of it as a loss, right, because it's a symbol. It's just a symbol of Michael's love for me, and that symbol just bought me and Tommy our freedom from Todd Manning, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: We're wasting our time, Ramsey.",
        "Ramsey: Would you keep your voice down?",
        "Todd: I told you, this is where I found out that Marcie was taking my kid to South America.",
        "Ramsey: If I had a dime for every witness who lied to me --",
        "Todd: I offered her a million dollars; I don't know why she'd lie.",
        "Ramsey: Well, neither do I -- yet -- but she did. We got an awful lot of people all over that tank town in South America come up dry. She lied; I'm going to find out the truth.",
        "Todd: How are you going to do that?",
        "Ramsey: Well, I am no longer a member of the F.B.I., so I do not have to follow F.B.I. procedure. I can just squeeze her.",
        "Todd: Now you're talking.",
        "Ramsey: Is that the one who told you about Argentina?",
        "Todd: No, that's not her.",
        "Moe: Where you been?",
        "Noelle: Has it slipped your feeble mind that I quit this lousy job?",
        "Moe: Come on, Noelle!",
        "Noelle: I'm here to pick up my check.",
        "Moe: I'm not going to give it to you until you agree to stick around.",
        "Noelle: Moe, I swear, if you don't hand over that check, I will stand --",
        "Moe: You know how difficult it is setting up for the New Year's Eve dinner, and Gigi hasn't even shown up yet -- big surprise!",
        "Noelle: Gee willikers. You sound like you're under the gun, Moe.",
        "Moe: You'll stay?",
        "Noelle: Are you kidding? You're getting exactly what you deserve! Now, where is my money?",
        "Todd: What makes you so sure that this Gigi chick still works here?",
        "Ramsey: I checked with a friend at the IRS.",
        "Todd: Oh, what makes you think that she'll change her story?",
        "Ramsey: Well, I'll make her an offer she can't refuse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Balsom find anything in Texas?",
        "Michael: He found out Marcie's headed to Argentina. She got a teaching job at an American school in a place called Igua\u00e7u Falls.",
        "John: Who told him that?",
        "Michael: A waitress who waited on her in a diner. Rex swore she's on the up- an-up. The problem is that she also told Todd that Marcie was headed to South America.",
        "John: So you're going to Argentina?",
        "Michael: Yeah -- tonight. I got to get there before Todd and Ramsey do.",
        "John: Ramsey's off the case.",
        "Michael: Since when?",
        "John: Since he got suspended from the bureau.",
        "Michael: What, for the way he was handling the case?",
        "John: For indirectly causing Marty's death.",
        "Michael: John, you still haven't really told --",
        "John: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Michael: All right.",
        "John: Well, what do you say we -- we open this thing up and find out what's in there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: So, brought the ring to the pawnshop, then, right?",
        "Gigi: Nope.",
        "Marcie: No?",
        "Gigi: I sold it to someone direct. A guy I knew from high school -- how weird is that?",
        "Marcie: High school?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Well, I thought that you grew up in Michigan.",
        "Gigi: So did he. He just happened to wander into the good old Bon-Jour, he saw your ring on my finger, I told him I was selling it, and he jumped on it. It was almost Christmas and he wanted to ask his girlfriend to marry him. I wonder what she's like. He's -- um -- he's a real funny guy, so I hope she gets his humor, you know?",
        "Marcie: Like you did?",
        "Gigi: Oh -- he could always make me laugh -- until he took off.",
        "Marcie: So what was this guy doing here anyway? I mean, was he here to see you?",
        "Gigi: Uh-uh.",
        "Marcie: No?",
        "Gigi: No -- he was surprised to see me.",
        "Marcie: Oh. But he was an old boyfriend? Right? Right? Hmm? Was he an old boyfriend?",
        "Gigi: No, it -- no, we were just kids, it was no big deal.",
        "Marcie: Uh-huh -- except for the fact that you were head over heels in love with him.",
        "Gigi: Why would you say that?",
        "Marcie: I don't know. It's just a vibe I'm getting, that's all, it's just a vibe.",
        "Gigi: You --",
        "Marcie: And nothing has changed -- you're still in love with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I love you.",
        "Adriana: I love you, too.",
        "Rex: You know, this may not be the most romantic thing a person can say, but being with you, having you in my life makes me a better person. And finally, for the first time, I'm looking forward to the rest of my life -- because I'll be sharing it with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: No, of course I'm not still in love with the guy! How did you even come up with that?",
        "Marcie: Well, you said that he took off, so, you know --",
        "Gigi: Oh -- one minute we were dating, and the next he was gone! Look, can we just drop it?",
        "Marcie: Sure, sure.",
        "Gigi: It's getting late; I should head to the diner -- the big New Year's bash. Moe's probably having a stroke.",
        "Marcie: No -- um -- look, listen, are you sure you're okay?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, yeah. Why?",
        "Marcie: You seem down.",
        "Gigi: No, I -- I'm just coming down with a cold, I think.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Well, listen, why don't you go home? I'll make you some chicken soup, you'll take it easy.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God, no. Moe will love that -- \"I need to go home because I have a case of the sniffles.\" Yeah, he'd love that.",
        "Marcie: He won't mind, okay, because, whether he likes it or not, I am going to work at the diner for you tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, you see that guy in there, the chef?",
        "Ramsey: Mm-hmm?",
        "Todd: If he sees me, he'll I.D. me for sure.",
        "Ramsey: Well, keep your back turned and your mouth shut.",
        "Todd: Okay, Ramsey.",
        "Ramsey: And I'll handle this.",
        "Moe: Don't tell me you got yourself another job already?",
        "Noelle: That's none of your damn business.",
        "Ramsey: [Texas accent] Pardon me, I was wondering if --",
        "Noelle: Uh -- can't you see I'm in the middle of something here? My check, Moe!",
        "Moe: I'll double your salary.",
        "Noelle: Whoop-dee-do.",
        "Moe: Triple it.",
        "Noelle: Quadruple it -- and don't even think about trying to talk to me, and you've got a deal.",
        "Moe: Hmm! Your apron's hanging right --",
        "Noelle: You talking to me?",
        "Moe: I was just going to say --",
        "Noelle: You're still talking!",
        "Moe: To myself -- I'm talking to myself! Jeez.",
        "Ramsey: That boss of yours must think the sun comes up just to hear him crow, am I right?",
        "Noelle: You got that right.",
        "Ramsey: I heard him say Gigi isn't in yet -- I hope her son's okay.",
        "Noelle: You know Gigi and Shane?",
        "Ramsey: My boy's in the same class as Shane -- he came down with a bad virus. I was wondering if Shane got sick, what with his asthma and all.",
        "Noelle: Oh, Gigi ends up in the emergency room with him every time he gets a cold.",
        "Ramsey: Yeah, got to be tough bringing him all up by herself.",
        "Noelle: I should call her. Oh, darn it, I left my cell at home -- wouldn't you know?",
        "Ramsey: Oh --",
        "Moe: Hey, don't stay on long -- I'm expecting a call.",
        "Noelle: Moe, if you say one more word to me --",
        "Todd: You're good, Ramsey.",
        "Ramsey: Ain't seen nothing yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Look, I know that the police don't normally go looking for an adult unless they've been missing for over 24 hours --",
        "Dorian: But this is a very unusual circumstance, because although my sister claims to be in a normal mental state, actually, her mental health is quite precarious.",
        "Talia: Is it possible your mom called a taxi to take her somewhere?",
        "Blair: There's -- you know, I think that that --",
        "Dorian: My sister is no more likely to call a taxi than I am to drive a taxi.",
        "Talia: Hmm. Do you have a photo of your mom with you?",
        "Blair: Yes, I do. Where'd it go? Here it is. Her hair is a little different now, a little bit more sophisticated.",
        "Talia: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, she's also dressing in a more sophisticated fashion. Oh, really -- I told you this -- this mental euphoria pharmaceutically induced was going to be a problem. Oh, I never should've gone out and left her alone. I should've stayed home and watched her.",
        "Blair: And where'd you go anyway?",
        "Dorian: Doesn't matter.",
        "Blair: Yeah, it matters. Where'd you go?",
        "Dorian: I went to see Clint.",
        "Blair: Oh --",
        "Dorian: I -- I thought I had some information that he might appreciate.",
        "Blair: Oh. And did he?",
        "Dorian: You know that old expression \"no good deed goes unpunished\"? Well, my good intentions were rewarded by Addie going missing, and finding Clint en flagrante with Nora.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You see, when you're not around, I -- I don't know what I want, I don't know who I am. So I was hoping that being here, being with you, I -- I could find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: The band you got -- it's great. They're really going to bring in the crowd.",
        "Sarah: You heard their music?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, Cris played some for me when he heard you might snag them. He was really psyched about this.",
        "Sarah: Too bad he can't be here tonight.",
        "Antonio: You're pretty sure he went to see Evangeline?",
        "Sarah: It's a safe bet. He was talking to Layla about it recently -- and Blair told him he needed to go see her to get things right. So -- that's good. I'm happy for Cris. Oh -- band's here.",
        "Man: We're early, huh?",
        "Sarah: Hey, guys. Ah, it's cool. Hey, I love your music. I'm so glad you guys took this gig.",
        "Man: Oh, yeah, us, too. We got a lot of friends in the area.",
        "Sarah: I hope they're all coming tonight.",
        "Man: So where do we unload?",
        "Sarah: Right around back.",
        "Man: You're Flash, right?",
        "Sarah: Ancient history.",
        "Man: I was a huge \"Flash of Light\" fan.",
        "Sarah: Thanks. Um -- you guys might want to do a sound check -- the acoustics in here are pretty funky.",
        "Man: Right. Um -- well, I just wanted to tell you that I thought your voice was amazing. It really inspired me, got me to write some really great material.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Thank you. That's going to help, thanks.",
        "Dorian: Well, what?",
        "Talia: Well, a taxi was dispatched to, um, \"La Boulaie\" around the time Ms. Cramer disappeared.",
        "Dorian: My sister did call a taxi.",
        "Talia: Yes, I guess she does know how to do that. Ahem.",
        "Blair: I just hope she's not, you know, marking things off of her list, you know?",
        "Talia: What list?",
        "Blair: Oh, um, Mama made this very long list of things that she wanted to do now that she's free, and some of them were a little --",
        "Dorian: Wacky.",
        "Blair: But they're -- no, just a little dangerous.",
        "Dorian: Why not call the taxi driver and ask him where he took her?",
        "Talia: I tried, and he's not picking up his cell phone or answering his pages, but I'll keep trying.",
        "Dorian: How could he do this to me?",
        "Blair: Oh, come on, Dorian, taxicab drivers need breaks, too.",
        "Dorian: I'm talking about Clint.",
        "Blair: Clint?",
        "Dorian: Yes -- if he hadn't led me on, made me think that he cared about me, I never would have gone over there to see him and left Addie alone, and she wouldn't have disappeared and -- really, Blair, I'm -- I'm worried that something terrible has happened to her. Aren't you?",
        "Talia: The cabbie finally answered his page.",
        "Dorian: Oh? And what?",
        "Talia: Addie's fine.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank heaven.",
        "Blair: Great. Did she go back to St. Ann's?",
        "Talia: Hmm, no. Uh -- not exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: A flute of your best champagne, please.",
        "Sarah: Uh -- I'm sorry, we're not open yet.",
        "Addie: Oh, I was so sure you would be. Oh, the cab driver took so long trying to find a bona fide nightclub, and the mambo is a must -- it's -- it's on my list, you see.",
        "Sarah: \"Your list\"?",
        "Addie: I don't have to leave, do I? I -- I won't be any trouble.",
        "Sarah: I'm sure you won't be. You want champagne?",
        "Addie: Oh, I'd love that! I can't wait until the clock strikes 12:00. The word \"wait\" is hateful to me. I want to live for now -- \"before the fiddlers have fled -- while there's moonlight and music and love and romance.\" Life isn't a dress rehearsal, you know. It's the main event -- opening night!",
        "Sarah: That is a positive way to look at things.",
        "Addie: Won't you join me?",
        "Sarah: And love and romance.",
        "Addie: Happy New Year.",
        "Sarah: You, too.",
        "Addie: Mmm. No wonder my sister loves this stuff so much.",
        "[Guitar riff sounds]",
        "Addie: What was that?",
        "Sarah: An indie band -- they're playing here tonight.",
        "Addie: What on earth is an indie band?",
        "Sarah: Stick around, you'll see.",
        "Man: It is okay if we rehearse?",
        "Sarah: No problem.",
        "Addie: He's an Adonis.",
        "[Sarah chucks]",
        "Man: You two ready to rock?",
        "Addie: No time like the present.",
        "Sarah: Go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I want you to know something. I want you to know that I think you're an incredible woman. Please come back.",
        "Cristian: You always believed in taking chances, making the difficult decisions. Maybe that's what I have to do now. But if you could just give me a sign, something -- is it time? Is it time to let you go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Shane's over at Lonnie's, so I'll stay here with Tommy and keep my germy self across the room.",
        "Marcie: I'll go get into my uniform. Um -- your friend -- you know, the guy that bought the ring?",
        "Gigi: Yeah?",
        "Marcie: Did he happen to notice the inscription inside of the engagement ring -- Michael's words to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Nice rocks, huh?",
        "Adriana: They're perfect.",
        "Rex: For our 10th anniversary -- because I'll be pulling in the big bucks by then --",
        "Adriana: I have no doubt",
        "Rex: You are getting one mother of a diamond.",
        "Adriana: Save your money -- I like this one just fine.",
        "Rex: In that case, how about a yacht?",
        "Adriana: Sure. But don't you dare try to replace this, because I am never giving it up.",
        "Rex: And I'm never giving you up -- even if you did have to be talked into marrying me.",
        "Adriana: I did not. I was just thrown by the dirt hound you gave me -- or whatever it's called.",
        "Rex: I don't know why I did that.",
        "Adriana: Because you're you, and you would never do anything typical like champagne, dinner --",
        "Rex: Putting the ring in a cream puff or something?",
        "[Adriana chuckles]",
        "Rex: With my luck, you'd choke on it.",
        "Adriana: Yeah. I just hope I don't lose it.",
        "Rex: A little loose?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Rex, why didn't you tell me?",
        "Rex: Oh -- \"tell you --\"",

        "Noelle: I tried Gigi's cell, no answer. I tried her landline, too, she's not home.",
        "Ramsey: I hope her kid's okay.",
        "Noelle: Me, too. There is one other place I could try. Gigi's got a friend who lives at the motel across the street, spends a lot of time there.",
        "Moe: Noelle, order's up!",
        "[Bell]",
        "Noelle: I'll be right back.",

        "Gigi: \"Meant to be\"? What is that supposed to mean?",

        "Ramsey: Oh. She baby-sits him, huh?",

        "Adriana: Well, why don't you like it?",
        "Rex: Because you're an independent woman, and saying \"we are one\" makes it sound like, you know, I want us joined at the hip or something -- equally creepy.",
        "Adriana: Well, not to me. To me, it means \"you and me against the world.\"",

        "John: Listen to me, hear me out, all right? This place you mentioned -- even I recognize it. That's a big tourist destination, right? So, one, I don't think she can afford to live there, and, two, I mean, it's very high-profile. Marcie -- she's been so smart and careful all along. Why would she just go and tell someone where she's going?",
        "Michael: Okay, so whoever told Todd and Rex was then just covering? Well, now what? I mean, I can't just give up.",
