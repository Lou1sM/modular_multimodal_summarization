        "When Nora comes home form the hospital, she immediately informs Bo that she wants to find out who ran her and Rex off the road. They are not aware that it was Matthew, but he figures it out. Yet, he protests that his parents need to realize that the cops can't do much an shouldn't waste their time knowing how effective they are when a criminal like Eddie Ford kidnaps the D.A. yet the police commissioner is not even aware, much less able to do anything about it. And he asks his dad just what he was doing when his mom was tied up by Eddie. When Bo is alone with his son, he demands to know what his problem is. Matthew indicates that he knows that Bo was with Inez the night his mom got kidnapped. He saw it with his own two eyes. Nora overhears and demands to know how her son could allege such vicious things. But Bo admits that it's true. He did sleep with Inez. Brody, Jessica, Natalie and John are all at a Lamaze class together. But John is clearly distracted. Vivian takes Natalie aside and asks if she is ok given the secret she's keeping from John, that Brody is the father of her baby. Daren attempts to get Destiny to reconcile with her parents/grandparents and come home. But she refuses and it appears she does not appreciate Daren interfering in her family's business. Rex admits to Kelly that he is not about to investigate Aubrey for her because it will only lead to trouble. But there appears to be suspicion about the secret phone calls Aubrey has whenever she is alone."

        "Jessica: Hee hee hoo hoo hee hee hoo hoo.",
        "Brody: Ha ha hoo hoo ha ha hoo hoo.",
        "Natalie: Hee hoo hee hoo.",
        "Jessica: No, no. Hee hee hoo.",
        "Brody: Hoo hee hoo hee hoo hee.",
        "Jessica: Okay, that's enough for now.",
        "Brody: I'm glad I don't have to do this breathing thing, too.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but the whole point of it is for you to know how to do the breathing so you can coach me.",
        "Brody: Hey, John's a take-charge kind of guy. Maybe he should coach all of us.",
        "Natalie: Well, the take-charge kind of guy has to get here first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Kelly, it's John McBain. You know, when you took that job at the \"Sun,\" I thought you said you were gonna handle manning. I guess that was wishful thinking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: What's all this?",
        "Rex: Sweat, pain. Spot, please.",
        "Kelly: Is this how you've been spending all your time?",
        "Rex: Since I went on an all-pie diet at Thanksgiving, yep. I'm trying to head off the slide into total flabbiness.",
        "Kelly: How about the slide into total unemployment? Because that's where you're gonna end up if you don't get off your ever-expanding butt and dig up some dirt on Joey's fianc\u00e9e. Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Hey, I was reading that.",
        "Joey: Well, read later. Play with fianc\u00e9 now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Hey, Mr. B.",
        "Clint: Destiny, good to see you. How was your Christmas?",
        "Destiny: I've had better.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry to hear that. Anything I can do to help?",
        "Destiny: Can you clear my friend Nate?",
        "Clint: Wish I could, but that's beyond what even I can do, I think.",
        "Destiny: That's okay. I'm sure he'll be fine.",
        "Clint: Why is that?",
        "Destiny: Because he didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Wow. Look at this place. You guys outdid yourselves.",
        "Bo: We couldn't let you come home to a mess.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but lying--that's okay.",
        "Bo: Sorry?",
        "Matthew: Nothing. Nothing.",
        "Nora: Okay, so how about we trade that overnight case in for my briefcase and you and I head down to the station?",
        "Bo: How about we just hold on for a second? You were just in an accident, red, so why not take a few days and recuperate?",
        "Nora: I think I'd recuperate a lot faster if I could be prosecuting the life out of the guy who ran Rex and I off of Route 7.",
        "Bo: We have plenty of time to find the driver.",
        "Nora: No, but I'm ready to rock and roll now.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but right now, we don't have much in the way of leads.",
        "Nora: No, that's okay. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So you think Nate is innocent?",
        "Destiny: I know he is.",
        "Clint: Really? How do you know?",
        "Destiny: Because it takes one cold-hearted snake to shoot a person point- blank, right? Even a person as bad as Eddie Ford. Nate's not like that.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you're probably right, but you know something? You never know what a person is really capable of--Cole Thornhart, for example.",
        "Destiny: Exactly. Everyone knows what happened to Cole after he shot Eli Clarke. We all saw what it did to Starr and his mom when he got sent away to Statesville. Nate would never put his mom and Dani through that.",
        "Clint: Well, here's hoping you're right.",
        "Destiny: You know, Mr. B, this whole thing with Nate is really bad, but I have to say I'm even more worried about Matthew.",
        "Clint: Really? Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Mom, did you say your accident was on Route 7?",
        "Nora: Yes, about a mile down the road past the Gas & Sip.",
        "Matthew's voice: You are such a hypocrite, Commissioner Buchanan. You're a joke! Uncle Clint is the only one who tells the truth. He's the only one who cares about me. All they care about is themselves.",
        "Bo: So what's this lead you got?",
        "Matthew: Dad, can't you put your badge down for two minutes? Mom just got home from the hospital. Give it a rest.",
        "Nora: Honey, it's okay. Your mom's strong. I can handle it.",
        "Bo: What are you thinking?",
        "Nora: Well, it's less of a lead and more like a hunch, and it's fueled by very hazy memories.",
        "Bo: That's okay. I'll take it.",
        "Nora: Okay, I remember when the car drifted into our lane, and just before Rex swerved to avoid it, I thought I saw a glow in the other car.",
        "Bo: A glow?",
        "Nora: I'm not positive, but I think it might have been a cell phone.",
        "Bo: So you think that the driver was talking on the phone and that's what caused the accident?",
        "Nora: It happens every day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: What have you found out so far?",
        "Rex: Well, that Nora's pie crusts give me cankles.",
        "Kelly: About Aubrey.",
        "Rex: Oh. Uh, not so much.",
        "Kelly: Rex.",
        "Rex: Hey, just chill, okay? It's the holidays. Can't a guy spend some time with his family?",
        "Kelly: Okay, fine. I'm sorry for being so pushy.",
        "Rex: It's okay. It's part of your charm.",
        "Kelly: I just--you know what? You did such a great job for me chasing down David Vickers. I cannot wait to find out what you turn up on Aubrey. So I guess this means you won't get started till the New Year hits?",
        "Rex: Actually...",
        "Kelly: Actually what? What? Don't tell me the Balsom-Banks-Morasco-DiSavoys celebrate Three Kings Day now?",
        "Rex: No, but now that you mention it--",
        "Kelly: Rex.",
        "Rex: The thing is, I can't take the case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I ordered some room service. Whatcha doing?",
        "Aubrey: I'm just looking for something to wear. Don't get me wrong--I love all this you-and-me time we've been spending, but I think it's about time we get back out there and rejoin society.",
        "Joey: Everything I need is right here.",
        "Aubrey: I'm serious. We have been holed up in here since Christmas. I'm going a little stir-crazy.",
        "Joey: I know something you can do with all that pent-up energy.",
        "Aubrey: I was thinking of something a little more constructive to do to burn calories, like perhaps break in that gym membership you got us.",
        "Joey: Why not? And afterwards, we can stop by my mom's for a little visit.",
        "Aubrey: Can't wait.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Joey: That was fast. You still don't think they don't like you?",
        "Aubrey: Come on, Joey. You know if we broke up right now, your family would throw a party.",
        "Joey: At least my mom's on our side.",
        "Aubrey: Your mom is great, but I can't help but feel that she would be relieved if she never saw me again.",
        "Joey: That is not true.",
        "Aubrey: I bet your mom has a secret plan to get me out of here right now.",
        "Viki: Funny you should say that. It so happens that I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You're not taking my case?",
        "Rex: No. The thing is--",
        "Kelly: How does a P.I. take a case one minute and just drop it the next, you know? I mean, doesn't a person's word mean anything anymore? You know, I really don't know what kind of world we live in...",
        "Rex: Ow!",
        "Kelly: When someone can promise something on a Monday and not deliver it on a Tuesday. Is that better?",
        "Rex: I wish I could help you, but I can't.",
        "Kelly: Right, because you have so many of these crunches to do, huh?",
        "Rex: Listen, the last person I investigated--Eddie Ford--he wound up dead.",
        "Kelly: So what? What are you, afraid of Aubrey? She's a toothpick. She's harmless.",
        "Rex: If she's so harmless, why do you want her investigated? What are you after Aubrey for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I told you your mom hates me.",
        "Joey: She doesn't hate you.",
        "Aubrey: Then why did she just say that she has a plan to get rid of me?",
        "Joey: Just be cool, okay?",
        "Aubrey: Hey, if she offers me something to drink, you're taking the first sip.",
        "Joey: Hey, Mom.",
        "Viki: Honey, I've been a little worried. You don't call. You don't write, you know.",
        "Joey: Aubrey and I have been taking it easy.",
        "Viki: That's good. I thought maybe you two could take it easy at Llanfair.",
        "Aubrey: I thought you just said that you wanted to get rid of me.",
        "Viki: No, no. I said I had a plan to get you out of here, which I do. I would like to get to know my future daughter-in-law.",
        "Aubrey: You didn't have enough of me at Christmas?",
        "Viki: Oh, no. Christmas didn't count. I was far too busy. So I thought I would like to make it up to you. I'd like to have a little dinner party for you.",
        "Aubrey: A dinner for me?",
        "Viki: Yeah. The 3 of us and Charlie and anyone that you two would like to invite. I don't know if you have friends or family in the area. If you do, invite them. Joey, you might like to bring your sisters.",
        "Joey: I know. We could invite Kelly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The tricky part is gonna be the dress because the baby will be here by then, but who knows what size I'm gonna be.",
        "Brody: One thing that's guaranteed--you'll be gorgeous.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Vivian: All right. Looks like everyone's here. Why don't we get started? Moms in front and partners behind, okay?",
        "Natalie: My partner's not here yet.",
        "Vivian: Okay. That's okay. We'll just...",
        "John: Price, who's in there with Salinger? Okay, remember, he's just a suspect, so you do everything by the book--",
        "Vivian: Detective McBain.",
        "John: Hold on a second. I'm about to get yelled at. I'm sorry I'm late. I just need to finish this call, and I'll be right in, all right?",
        "Vivian: Please turn your phone off.",
        "John: By law I can't do that. I'm chief of detectives.",
        "Vivian: Well, I am the chief of birth.",
        "Brody: Yeah, what if there's a crisis?",
        "Vivian: Would you keep your phone on in the delivery room during labor?",
        "John: Uh...",
        "Vivian: That was rhetorical.",
        "John: Okay, Price, look, there's something more important. Let all the bad guys out, all right? I got to go learn how to breathe out of my ears or something, okay? Yeah.",
        "Vivian: All right, that's it. Now let's get everyone settled. I have one more handout to give you. Natalie, can you help me?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Vivian: So it looks like you and John are doing well.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, we're doing okay.",
        "Vivian: I'm just a little concerned at the stress that you must be under. It cannot be easy for you to take this class with John and the father of your baby and your sister over there.",
        "Natalie: Ha ha! You know what? I think everything's gonna be okay. I've got it under control. Everyone's gonna walk away happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Is there something wrong with Matthew?",
        "Destiny: Well...",
        "Destiny's voice: Is Nate telling the truth? Did you really say something about his mother?",
        "Matthew's voice: Yeah. I called her a whore.",
        "Destiny's voice: What?",
        "Matthew's voice: I called a whore and a bitch and a home-wrecker because that's what she is.",
        "Destiny's voice: Matthew, why would you even think that?",
        "Matthew's voice: Because she's sleeping with my dad.",
        "Destiny: I guess he's just under a lot of pressure, you know, with basketball and the SATs coming up.",
        "Clint: He hasn't said anything about it to me.",
        "Destiny: That's no surprise. I'm sure he wouldn't want his big-shot uncle seeing him sweat.",
        "Clint: Destiny, I'm glad that Matthew has a good friend like you to confide in, and I hope you'll be there for him if he needs it.",
        "Destiny: There's no \"if\" about it. Hey, Ms. Salinger. How's Nate doing?",
        "Inez: He's being held at the police station for now, but his lawyer T\u00e9a Delgado is with him.",
        "Destiny: Let him know I'm pulling for him, okay?",
        "Inez: Thanks, Destiny. I'll do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: Thanks for meeting me.",
        "Destiny: You said you had a surprise for me. It better not be another Christmas present. You already spent way too much on that.",
        "Darren: This one didn't cost a thing. In fact, it comes straight from my heart.",
        "Mr. Evans: Destiny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: What are you doing here?",
        "Clint: Waiting for you.",
        "Inez: So, what is this? You're stalking me now, scoping out my route to work?",
        "Clint: You won't take my calls.",
        "Inez: I don't have time to play games with you. I'm trying to save my son, who's been accused of a murder he didn't commit.",
        "Clint: What makes you so sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: If we can get the records of all calls made that bounced off the towers in the vicinity of the accident at the time of the accident...",
        "Bo: And then find out if those people own cars with tire treads that would match the tracks that we found...",
        "Nora: Exactly. We could narrow down our field of suspects.",
        "Matthew: Can you really I.D. a car just by tire tracks?",
        "Bo: Yeah. We've done it before, and it's a great idea, but I'm not sure that a hazy memory is gonna be enough for us to get a warrant for those phone records.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, and there's no way you could be so sure. I mean, you were walking around in a daze after the accident. Your memory might be all jumbled.",
        "Nora: I don't know. It just feels right to me.",
        "Matthew: But who knows what really happened? Maybe the other driver didn't even realize he caused an accident. There's no way to find out. There's only so much the cops can do.",
        "Bo: We'll do our best.",
        "Nora: I know that.",
        "Matthew: Except your best doesn't always work.",
        "Bo: Excuse me?",
        "Matthew: Just stating a fact.",
        "Bo: And what fact is that?",
        "Matthew: Not all crimes can be solved. How do you expect the police to find out what happened to Rex and mom if they hadn't even realized that the district attorney had been kidnapped by a known criminal? And did you even know that Eddie Ford had Mom?",
        "Bo: No, I didn't.",
        "Matthew: I guess you were just busy. Say, what were you doing when Mom was tied up in that motel room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: All right, everyone, let's start with some ice-breakers, okay? Couples, break up into groups, okay?",
        "Woman: So, what helps you all relax?",
        "Brody: A good long run.",
        "Jessica: Foot massage.",
        "Natalie: Playing pool.",
        "John: Uh...",
        "Natalie: Work.",
        "Vivian: Hoo hoo hee hee hoo hoo hee hee. Uh, join us, chief?",
        "John: Hmm? No. I'm all right. Don't worry about me.",
        "Vivian: Come on, chief. You need to breathe. It's probably why you're so uptight. Come on. Give it a shot. It'll make you feel better. I promise.",
        "John: Really, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Natalie: Hee hee hoo hoo hee hee hoo hoo..",
        "John: Hee hee hoo hoo. Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah! Ha ha ha!",
        "John: There?",
        "Natalie: No, it's not there.",
        "John: There?",
        "Natalie: No, it's--",
        "John: Here?",
        "Vivian: All right, why don't we all gather around, and I'll demonstrate on the chief here, okay? All right, partners, you want to have your palm on mom's sacrum, okay, right here, and when Natalie has a contraction, you want to really press hard there, okay?",
        "John: I got it.",
        "Vivian: Okay, can you show us? There you go. Yup.",
        "Natalie: Okay, you got it.",
        "Vivian: Good job, chief. See? We'll make a daddy out of you yet.",
        "John: Yeah. I hate her. She's terrible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, of course Kelly is very welcome, so tell her 7:00.",
        "Joey: You mean tonight?",
        "Viki: That was the idea. Is that not good?",
        "Joey: Sorry. Mind if we take a rain check? I was gonna take Aubrey out.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God. It's New Year's Eve. How stupid am I? Of course you're going to take her out. Don't worry about it. We'll do it another time.",
        "Aubrey: Thank you so much, though, for the invitation, Mrs. Banks, and I'm sorry that I leapt to the wrong conclusion.",
        "Viki: All already forgotten. I hope you guys have a lovely evening.",
        "Aubrey: Actually, you're right. Joey hasn't seen you in days, and I have to finish getting ready for the gym, so why don't you stay? You guys can chat while I do that.",
        "Viki: Thank you. I'd like to do that.",
        "Joey: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Viki: For what, sweetheart?",
        "Joey: For the way you're treating Aubrey. I appreciate you making the effort.",
        "Viki: Of course I'll make an effort. Thank you. I'd like her to feel welcome. Honey, one little thing. When we get around to planning the dinner, you might want to reconsider inviting Kelly.",
        "Joey: Since when don't you like Kelly?",
        "Viki: Oh, I love Kelly. I adore Kelly. The problem is, Kelly adores you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Joey is about to marry a woman that he hardly knows, and all I'm trying to do is just protect a friend. Sue me.",
        "Rex: Yeah, except you don't want to be friends with Joey. You're in love with him, and you want him back, and that's why you're doing all this meddling, and I think it's a big mistake.",
        "Kelly: Really? And what's your hunch based on?",
        "Rex: I saw Joey and Aubrey together at Christmas. I'm sorry, but it looked like love to me, and after all the people that came between me and Gigi, I don't want to get in the way of that. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: Destiny Evans, this is your mini-family reunion.",
        "Destiny: Who else is here?",
        "Mr. Evans: It's just me. I figured it might be a scene if I sprang your-- anyone else on you.",
        "Destiny: Okay, I did not ask for this.",
        "Mr. Evans: I know.",
        "Darren: I set it up. Don't be mad, okay? You refused to talk to your parents, so I thought if you faced them you'd find a way to figure it out.",
        "Mr. Evans: Destiny, you can't keep on living with Shaun.",
        "Destiny: Why not?",
        "Mr. Evans: Because I miss you, and so does your mother.",
        "Destiny: You mean my--",
        "Mr. Evans: And because we belong together. Come home. Give us a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I know my son. There is no way he could have killed Eddie.",
        "Clint: Inez, do you seriously think that you're the best judge of character?",
        "Inez: Obviously not.",
        "Clint: You didn't think you were able to sleep with Bo, but you did.",
        "Inez: No, I didn't.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry. That's my mistake. You just made Bo think he slept together, which is just as well. So long as Bo believes it, so will Nora.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay, honey, I know you're upset about what happened, but you need to ease up here. Your father can't protect everyone every minute of the day.",
        "Matthew: I guess he was taking care of some other damsel in distress while you were being kidnapped by Eddie.",
        "Nora: The way things happened, no one, not even your father could possibly have known that Eddie took me.",
        "Bo: And I still don't get what Eddie Ford wanted with you. There's gotta be something more to all this.",
        "Nora: I've said it once. I'm gonna say it again. He did not act alone. I think he had help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I wonder if you'll be this damn arrogant when Bo finally finds out the truth.",
        "Clint: What truth is that?",
        "Inez: That we never slept together, that I was coerced into setting up this whole thing by his loving brother who is out to destroy him.",
        "Clint: I can't think of a reason why that would happen.",
        "Inez: Think harder. Eddie's dead. I don't have a single reason not to tell Bo everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: How about a nice hot bath? You've been talking about that since we left the hospital.",
        "Matthew: Wait, Mom.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: Who do you think helped Nate's dad?",
        "Nora: You know...it's just-- I really am not positive. It's just really strange.",
        "Matthew: Maybe it was Nate. Maybe they were in on it together and they got into an argument and that's why Nate killed him.",
        "Nora: No, honey. Nate's just being held for questioning. He hasn't been officially charged with anything.",
        "Bo: And Nate couldn't stand his dad. So I can't see why he'd help him do anything.",
        "Matthew: Why not? You come up with something better?",
        "Nora: I think I will take that hot bath.",
        "Bo: I think I'll give you a hand.",
        "Nora: All right.",
        "Matthew: Laying it on a little thick, huh, Dad?",
        "Nora: That's okay. I think I can work the faucets myself.",
        "Bo: What's your problem?",
        "Matthew: I don't have a problem. You, on the other hand--",
        "Bo: I'm serious, Matthew. Don't screw with me. I'm in no mood to put up with your attitude.",
        "Matthew: What are you gonna do? Replace me with another kid? Kind of like you replaced mom with another woman?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: Visualize somewhere peaceful and calm, anywhere where you feel most comfortable.",
        "Brody: How am I doing so far?",
        "Jessica: Just fine.",
        "Brody: I seem a little wired, but it's only because I'm really excited. I just can't wait to be a dad.",
        "Jessica: I know.",
        "Brody: Don't you worry. I'm gonna be cool as a cucumber when the big day gets here.",
        "Jessica: You will, huh?",
        "Brody: Oh, yeah. I'm good to go right now. I got my bag packed. I got multiple routes to the hospital all mapped out. I will be the picture of serenity.",
        "Jessica: Great. Why don't you start right now?",
        "Brody: Right, right. You're under water looking out into the blue, blue ocean.",

        "John: You're in your cocoon. It's a cool, dark place... maybe 7 x 9 feet, windowless, but there's a big lock on the door and you're safe. One point of entry.",
        "Natalie: Are you describing a jail cell?",
        "Vivian: Okay, partners, let's remember our role. We want to be a source of strength and support for mom. Try not to get ahead of yourselves. Trust me. You'll be holding your baby in no time.",

        "Vivian's voice: It's perfect, but don't take my word for it. Ask daddy.",
        "Brody's voice: Oh, hey, baby. I'm your daddy.",
        "Vivian: You two might want to try practicing this at home. You seem more stressed out now than when you started.",

        "Kelly: I did, till I had that bad feeling about her.",
        "Rex: Which happened right after Joey proposed to her. Funny how that works.",
        "Kelly: Hey, Rex, come on. I am not out to hurt Joey. I want him to be happy.",
        "Rex: He is happy...right now, but if you keep this up, he won't be.",

        "Viki: Well, the other day when Aubrey and I walked in on you and Kelly in the library, Kelly seemed very affected.",
        "Joey: Because she had lemon in her eye.",

        "Joey: She didn't say anything about it to me.",
        "Viki: No, darling, she wouldn't. She would keep that to herself.",
        "Joey: Mom, really. There's nothing there. You're seeing things.",
        "Viki: I'm not so sure, honey.",
        "Joey: I am, trust me. Aubrey is in no way threatened by Kelly. There's nothing to be threatened by. Kelly and I are way, way over. Besides, even if Kelly did want me back, she can't have me. I'm Aubrey's.",

        "Destiny: Okay, look, I don't know what Darren told you to make you think coming here was a good idea, but he shouldn't have butted in.",
        "Mr. Evans: Darren cares about you. So do I. Okay. Maybe this was too soon.",
        "Destiny: You think?",
        "Mr. Evans: I'll give you some more time, but I'm not giving up on you, not till you come back home where you belong.",

        "Inez: Okay, here we go. What's the catch? What is it this time?",
        "Clint: Your son is facing a murder charge. A Delgado defense does not come cheap. If you go and shoot off your mouth, what incentive will I have to foot the bill?",
        "Inez: Don't worry about me. I will find the money.",
        "Clint: You might as well start with Nate's college fund, because he's not gonna need it at Statesville prison, which is where he's gonna end up regardless.",
        "Inez: Regardless?",
        "Clint: Around here, Inez, damning evidence has a way of just showing up at the worst possible time. And evidence that can exonerate an innocent party, sometimes it just--poof! Disappears into thin air.",
        "Inez: You wouldn't do that. Nate is a child. You wouldn't ruin his whole life.",
        "Clint: That depends. Are you gonna ruin my plans for Bo and Nora?",

        "Matthew: Why does that matter, when I saw you guys together?",
        "Bo: You what?",
        "Matthew: The night mom got away from Eddie, I went to Inez's apartment. When I saw your car in the parking lot, I tried to tell myself that maybe you were there for something else, for some other reason, and so I went up. And you know what I saw? I saw you all over her. And that's when I found out who you really were--a liar and a hypocrite. And you know what, you don't even deserve the Buchanan name.",
        "Nora: Whoa! Matthew! Where on earth do you get off talking to your father--",
        "Matthew: Mom, you don't--",

        "Jessica and Natalie: The baby.",
        "Brody: Okay, I said almost.",

        "Aubrey: Um, just a florist I'm thinking of hiring for the wedding, and he says he has an opening and wants to pitch us some ideas.",
        "Joey: Oh, sounds exciting.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, stop. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Why don't you go on ahead to the gym?",
        "Joey: Sure you don't need help with the flowers?",
        "Aubrey: I'm sure. Seriously, go. I will catch up with you there.",

        "Kelly: How about this? If you find out that Aubrey isn't on the level, would you change your mind about her then?",
        "Rex: Would you change your mind if I found out she is?",
        "Kelly: Yes.",
        "Rex: Just like that?",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm. I will make you a deal. Give me one morning, go to Aubrey's room, give it the full Balsom, and if you do not turn up a single shred of evidence that Aubrey isn't who she says she is, I'll let it go.",
        "Rex: Really?",
        "Kelly: Yes, and I will let Joey go, too.",

        "Destiny: What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? How could you set me up like that?",
        "Darren: I had to do something. If I hadn't, you'd never see your parents.",
        "Destiny: Look, if I want to see my grandparents, that's up to me, not you. You're not my boss. You're my boyfriend.",
        "Darren: How would I know?",
        "Destiny: What?",
        "Darren: You don't treat me like your boyfriend. Every time you're upset, you go running to Matthew.",
        "Destiny: Matthew has been through this kind of thing. He understands how hard a time I'm going through right now.",
        "Darren: Then maybe Matthew should be your boyfriend.",
        "Destiny: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Darren: It means you're not the girl I fell for anymore. Look, I know you're hurt and you're angry.",
        "Destiny: Don't you think I have a right to be?",
        "Darren: Look, maybe, but it's blinding you from all the good things that they've done. It's like you've forgotten how to forgive, or maybe you never knew in the first place. I don't know. I just know that's not the kind of person that I want in my life.",
        "Destiny: What are you saying?",
        "Darren: Maybe Matthew likes you all bitter and nasty, but I don't.",

        "Inez: I can't believe that you would sink this low, threatening me with my son's freedom.",
        "Clint: Threatening! On the contrary. I am making a very generous offer to pay for your son's defense, but, Inez, it's totally up to you. Your son or Bo. To me, it seems very easy, but you take your time and think it through. But don't take too long, because every minute that you wait, that's another minute that your son spends behind bars.",

        "Nora: Where is all this coming from, young man? I asked you a question!",
        "Matthew: Fine. I'll apologize. I'll explain, whatever you want me to do, but Dad has to do the same.",

        "Matthew: Is that true, Dad? How long you gonna play her like a fool? I think she deserves to know.",
        "Bo's voice: I don't think Nora would care what you call it. I slept with the woman.",
        "Clint's voice: These fights that you've been having. Didn't you tell me you threw the Sam Rappaport thing in Nora's face? She's gonna think this is some kind of payback.",

        "Bo's voice: What, you mean is she gonna tell? No, I don't think so.",
        "Clint's voice: So, what is the problem? You telling Nora would just be easing your guilt, and it would probably end up hurting her and the marriage, and what for?",
        "Nora: Matthew, what are you talking about? What is it you think I have a right to know?",
        "Matthew: Dad cheated on you... with his assistant.",

        "John: Yeah. I know it sounds kind of old-fashioned, but I'd like us to be married before the baby gets here.",
        "Jessica: We have to coordinate on dates, because between Brody and me and Joey and Aubrey, there are a lot of Buchanan weddings coming up.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I guess we don't really have much of a choice. We're gonna have to wait till the spring.",
        "John: There's always a choice.",

I'm assuming they're the rantings and ravings of a bitter and angry teenager, but I mean, what was that all about? I thought we'd seen the last of Mr. Hyde after his operation, but wow. I mean, it's getting worse, Bo. It's getting much worse. That tops anything he ever said when he was in his wheelchair.",
        "Bo: Mmm.",
        "Nora: I mean, what's going on here? Where is this all coming from? We have to do something about this. We can't just let this slide. I'm thinking maybe we pull him off the basketball team or--well, he can kiss that internship at B.E. good-bye, that's for damn sure. I'm sure we'll hear about it from Clint and stuff like that, but that's okay, because we can't let this slide. You do agree, right, Bo? Bo, we have to nip this in the bud, right?",
        "Bo: Nora.",
        "Nora: What is it? What is this? Where is this all coming from? Why is he saying all these things? Why would he say these things, these incredibly hurtful things? Why would he say that you're sleeping with Inez?",
