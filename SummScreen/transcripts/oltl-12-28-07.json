        "Rex: Paris, Texas, didn't hold a candle to you, baby.",
        "Adriana: Thank you, Texas, for bringing him back to me with a proposal and a ring.",
        "Rex: Shall we head to the party, my betrothee?",

        "Rex: Oh, from you it just sounds naughty.",

        "Adriana: Is this about Marcie?",
        "Rex: Did you find her?",
        "John: No. We just wanted to go over a few details from your trip.",

        "Michael: Can we come in?",
        "Adriana: Of course. Sorry. We were just heading out.",
        "John: It'll only take a minute. Look, mike told me about the waitress you talked to in Paris, Texas.",
        "Rex: Then you know everything I do.",
        "John: I guess we sort of wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth, so to speak. What did she -- what did she say?",
        "Rex: Like I told mike, I met this waitress who recognized Marcie's picture. She said that she served her, that they chatted, and that Marcie had mentioned something about heading to a place called Igua\u00e7u Falls in Argentina. Supposedly there's some school that Marcie was thinking about teaching at. You know, I'd be willing to dust off my high school Spanish, fly down there and track her down. I would just need cash for expenses.",
        "John: Did you ever think that maybe she was lying to you?",
        "Rex: She wouldn't do that.",
        "John: How do you know?",

        "Natalie: I decided to come here and bring you some color and we can kick off the new --",

        "Natalie: Okay, what exactly is the problem here?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: All right, forget it, man. You don't got to tell me squat. Let's rock and roll.",
        "Cole: No, I mean, I would think you were weird, too, if you told your girlfriend that you couldn't hang out with her on New Year's Eve.",
        "Jared: Yeah, if I had a girlfriend. So what'd you tell her?",
        "Cole: You heard what I said. I just don't feel like celebrating.",
        "Jared: She buy that?",
        "Cole: No. No, she didn't. Man, but it would just be, you know, me standing around and her watching me act like I'm having a good time. I mean, how much would -- how much would that suck?",
        "Jared: Ah!",
        "Cole: Ah!",
        "Jared: Ha!",
        "Cole: No!",
        "Jared: So you're staying here for her?",
        "Cole: Man, listen, she's got her rich aunt's house to herself, you know? I mean, she's probably all dressed up, wearing that special perfume and --",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Cole: You know, and I'd just be thinking about --",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Cole: I mean, I love Starr, I really do. She's great. I mean, she's been great since my mom's died, but I just feel like being alone tonight.",
        "Jared: Well, I'm here, dude.",
        "Cole: That's right. Yeah, I got your no-girl-having butt to keep me company.",
        "Jared: Ah.",

        "Langston: Talk to Cole?",
        "Starr: He's not coming.",
        "Markko: I guess I sort of get it. You know, must be a hard night for him.",
        "Starr: But you know what? It's New Year's Eve and he's my boyfriend. I can cheer him up, right? What?",
        "Langston: Well -- okay, what if he and his mom had some cool ritual? What if -- what if his whole family did?",
        "Markko: Right, and then his dad dies, and Cole and his mom have to get through it just the two of them?",
        "Langston: And then his mom dies, and he's forced to face this whole day on his own?",
        "Starr: But he has me.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but --",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: You know what? It's just a made-up holiday, anyway. It doesn't really matter.",
        "Starr: It matters to me, okay?",
        "Langston: Starr, I really don't think you should go over there. This should be fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I cannot believe my mom asked Cristian to stay, and he agreed.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, that is one courageous cat. So, tell me, how do you think I did with the lady?",
        "Layla: You want a grade on your first Christmas with my mother?",
        "Vincent: Oh, forget that. Just give me your gut feeling.",
        "Layla: My gut? Okay. Um -- I brought you home because I wanted you with me, not because I want or need my mother's approval. I really don't care what she thinks.",
        "Vincent: But I do.",
        "Layla: Why?",
        "Vincent: Because I care about you. That's why. You know, I can't believe I have to explain this.",
        "Layla: Well, my mother didn't ask for your credit report, and as far as I know, she didn't hire a private investigator, so all in all, you're ahead.",
        "Vincent: Well, she did give me a little bit of the third degree about my business prospects.",
        "Layla: Oh, don't worry about it. The only person Lisa Williamson was determined not to like was Cristian. Too bad he's not here now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Hey, you killed that last set. Murdered it.",
        "Man: I'd say man one, 10 to 15.",
        "Sarah: Yeah. Either way, it was criminal.",
        "Man: Nice. You keep up.",
        "Sarah: I am the artist formerly known as Flash.",
        "Man: And I'm a boy who's all dressed up with a great tour, record deal in the works, but no girl to join the adventure.",
        "Sarah: I'm sure you'll find some barely legal groupie to keep you warm on the bus.",
        "Man: What if I don't want barely legal? What if I want someone more like you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I have no idea where Talia's spending New Year's.",
        "Shaun: Bogus.",
        "Antonio: What, you think I'm lying?",
        "Shaun: No, I know you're telling me the truth, and that makes you -- no offense -- nothing but a damn fool.",
        "Talia: So I got a transfer to the police department at Cherryvale, and they want me to start right after New Year's, so I'm, you know, going early to get settled in, find a place to live, that kind of thing.",
        "Cristian: Did something happen?",
        "Talia: What do you mean?",
        "Cristian: Well, a transfer to Cherryvale? Isn't that, like, some kind of demotion? And the worst thing that can happen in Cherryvale is someone's newspaper gets stolen off the lawn.",
        "Talia: Okay, it was my choice.",
        "Cristian: You wanted this?",
        "Talia: Yes, I did. Ahem.",
        "Cristian: Is this because of my brother?",
        "Talia: No. Why would you say that? I'll have a good job in a quiet precinct and, who knows, maybe I can even finish that sweater I started knitting three years ago.",
        "Cristian: Right, okay, so then why are you here? I mean, why are you taking the bus?",
        "Talia: Oh -- because my car's in the shop. It's -- look, I just -- I didn't want to wait, you know? Early bird, worm.",
        "Cristian: Talia --",
        "Talia: What?",
        "Cristian: Nobody quits their job and moves by bus on New Year's Eve to a town in the middle of the woods unless it's personal.",
        "Talia: Of course it's personal, it's my life and I wanted a change of pace and now I'll have one -- a change of scenery, and I'll have that, too.",
        "Cristian: So what does Antonio think about this, because I know for a fact that he thinks you're a very good cop.",
        "Talia: Yeah, well, now I'll be a really good cop for somebody that I'm not -- okay, so some of this does have to do with Antonio.",
        "Cristian: Ever think about talking to him?",
        "Talia: I did. That didn't really go over so well. Look, I -- I got to get out of this funk that I'm in, I got to stop working for somebody that I -- I've got to let it go, Cris.",
        "Cristian: How can you let go of something you never had? That you never gave a shot?",
        "Talia: Well, Antonio didn't really, like, let that be an option for me.",
        "Cristian: All right, listen. This may be none of my business, but if you get on that bus without trying, you're taking the easy way out. And, hey, if that's the kind of person you are, then maybe you shouldn't be with my brother.",
        "Talia: Did Antonio talk to you about what went on with us?",
        "Cristian: He just said something about not being ready to me on, you know, after Jessica.",
        "Talia: You know, it was slightly more humiliating than that. At least for me. Huh. I don't really want to get into this, but suffice it to say, your brother's just not that into me, and I don't really know what I'm supposed to do about that.",
        "Cristian: Fight for him?",
        "Talia: What about him fighting for me?",
        "Cristian: You're right. You deserve that, too.",
        "Talia: Yes, I do.",
        "Cristian: But here you are, alone, at a bus station, 90 minutes before the New Year rings in.",
        "Talia: So?",
        "Cristian: So my brother's at Capricorn, probably halfway through his third drink, getting ready to turn in and pretend that tonight's just another night.",
        "Talia: Yeah, there's really nothing I can do about that.",
        "Cristian: You know, I was thinking something like that a couple of hours ago, but then I realized there's always something you can do. Maybe you should give Antonio a little more time.",
        "Talia: You know, Cris, the thing is ever since 9/11, you know, I was on the job in lower Manhattan. And after that, it -- the whole, like everything -- I just feel like wasting time is the biggest waste of time. Huh. Do you know what I mean?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I hear you. Happy New Year.",
        "Talia: Thanks, Cris. Happy New Year.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You think I'm a fool? You don't know me, man. And you and Talia didn't know each other anywhere near as well as you pretended.",
        "Shaun: Listen, Talia laid it all out there for you. She made a fool of herself for you -- not once, but twice. And when she finally came out and shared how she felt, you dissed her.",
        "Antonio: I didn't diss anyone.",
        "Shaun: Right. That's why you're here, pouring drinks at the bar, alone, and Talia's MIA. Look, I'm just saying. If I had a beautiful woman like Talia Sahid looking at me the way she looks at you, I would falling at her feet. Happy New Year's, Papi -- my man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: You know, you made me very proud the way you stood up to your mother for Cristian.",
        "Layla: I just don't want my mom going down that same road, you know? We're all miserable about what happened to Vange, but blame it on Cristian? She wouldn't want that.",
        "Vincent: Well, it was a good thing Cristian got to see your sister.",
        "Layla: Yeah. I just wonder what he's going to do about Sarah when he gets back, because the way it's looking, she's pretty ready to move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: You want me to go on tour with you?",
        "Man: Yeah, why not? You dig our music, you know your way around a tour bus.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, but I'm not some stoned-out-of-her-mind groupie who will laugh at all your jokes. I'll actually have ideas about things.",
        "Man: Like what?",
        "Sarah: You name it -- gigs, venues, hotels, the works.",
        "Man: So you'd be like our road manager?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, only I don't carry gear.",
        "Man: I'm okay with that.",
        "Sarah: Wait -- is this a job offer?",
        "Man: It is, and something more, too, I hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's like an exact replica of the ring that I got for Marcie when I asked her to marry me. Where did you get it?",
        "Adriana: Michael, what's the deal? Rings -- they all look alike, don't they?",
        "Michael: Can -- can I see it?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- look, this is my ring, okay? Rex even had it inscribed.",
        "Rex: Adriana, I -- the thing --",
        "Michael: Does it say --",
        "Adriana: \"We are --\"",
        "Michael: \"One.\" \"We are one.\"",

        "Natalie: Well, I have to say you are mighty handsome for a shooting victim.",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "Roxy: That's because of the boxers he's wearing.",
        "Natalie: Come again? What are you doing?",
        "Roxy: Hmm. I got it for him. They've got style, they've got oomph, they've got je ne sais pa quoi. I think they're Miles' favorite gift, right?",
        "Miles: And very, very comfortable.",
        "Roxy: Mm-hmm, yeah -- making him look like -- good enough to eat.",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Okay, yeah. I'm so sorry about this.",
        "Miles: Oh, that's okay. No, don't be.",
        "Roxy: You know, why don't you keep your shorts on? We won't be long.",
        "Natalie: Okay -- what is wrong with you?",
        "Roxy: Me? What's wrong with you, you redheaded hussy?",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Roxy: I feed you, I clothe you, I treat you like you're a real Balsom and what do you do? You throw your curvier, younger, and corporate-raiding self at my man!",
        "Natalie: Your what?",
        "Roxy: Mine, mine -- m-I-n-e, mine, so you keep your grubby hands off!",

        "Cole: Ah, get off! No --",
        "Jared: Oh! Yeah! I am smelling a comeback. Ah, well, you want a soda?",
        "Cole: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Jared: There you go. So, yes, I did meet someone earlier this year.",
        "Cole: Yeah -- and?",
        "Jared: And she was all that.",
        "Cole: Nice.",
        "Jared: It didn't work out, though.",
        "Cole: Sorry.",
        "Jared: No, it was -- it was my fault mostly -- or totally. But you, man -- man, you got this great girlfriend and -- I really think you should reconsider not going out tonight.",
        "Cole: I don't know.",
        "Jared: You said you loved her, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Well, then?",
        "Cole: I don't know. I mean -- I mean, I used to love hanging out with her all the time, but ever since -- well -- I don't know. I just think about how much her life is different from mine.",
        "Jared: Yeah. Look, man, I had a tough time, too, when my mom passed. But what I can say is it gets easier, and even if tonight starts out rough, you know, who knows? You might get into it. And if there's 20 minutes where you're having fun, that's better than yesterday, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Jared: All I can say is this -- if you have the chance to be with the woman you love tonight, I think you should take it.",
