        "Mitch demands that Dorian finds a way to get Bo fired from his job. She is not willing to do that until he gives her a photo of Bo and Nora kissing. She goes to show it to Clint and Clint admits to her that he will endorse her and encourage her to get them both fired from their jobs and into trouble. Stacy is spooked by Mitch Laurence's \"plan\" to take her baby. Rex confronts Mitch and Mitch tells him he wants Stacy's baby. Dorian goes to the station to tell Bo, Nora, John and Natalie she'd like them all to attend her mayoral inauguration ball. None of them are enthused. But Clint tells Kim he'd like her to be his date to Dorian's ball and is ready to support Dorian in her cause."

        "Rex: I won't be alone.",
        "Oliver: Laurence isn't allowed visitors.",

        "Mitch: Did you get my package?",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "Mitch: Quite an eyeful, yes?",
        "Dorian: Why are you calling me?",
        "Mitch: Why does Bo Buchanan still have his job? I just gave you all the ammunition you need. Why have you not fired him?",
        "Dorian: Ohh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey. I hear congratulations are in order.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "John: Matthew.",
        "Nora: Oh. He's -- he's being evaluated right now at the -- at the hospital.",
        "Bo: He walked straight to us on Christmas Eve.",
        "Nora: Yeah. It was really pretty exciting.",
        "John: It's amazing. It's a good thing he's so stubborn.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well, gets it from him.",
        "Bo: No. Her.",
        "Nora: What? No.",
        "John: Right.",
        "Nora: All right. So what's up?",
        "John: What do you say we close this Laurence case?",
        "Bo: Close on the Stuart murder or Landers?",
        "John: His suicide attempt. I.A.'s taken my statement. His blood, his prints, are on the weapon.",
        "Bo: Sounds clean.",
        "John: Well, of course. He's claiming I framed him, that I did it.",
        "Natalie: No. John didn't do anything.",
        "John: But Laurence stabbed himself.",
        "Bo: Why?",
        "John: I guess he was upset he had to go to prison. He freaked out, he grabbed the letter opener, and he stabbed himself.",
        "Nora: Wow.",
        "Bo: And you saw this, Nat?",
        "John: Um, she just got there. Right?",
        "Nora: Well, do we have Natalie on record, too?",

        "Kim: No, not really.",
        "Clint: Well, I'm getting some paperwork together to take to my attorneys. Could you come over and help?",
        "Kim: Of course. I'll be right there. My man needs me. He's getting some stuff together for the divorce. Nora, you can take that butt-ugly wardrobe, but please leave that 2-seat convertible. Ah! Hello! Could you be a little excited for me? I was happy for you when you said Rex's dad was gonna get you Rex. What?",
        "Stacy: Just kind of tricky, that's all.",
        "Kim: How?",
        "Stacy: Mitch had a condition.",
        "Kim: Yeah. From what I've heard, the condition's called craziness.",
        "Stacy: No. He wants my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So are you having a good time with your dad?",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Is it, like, guyland all the time?",
        "Shane: Yeah. We're great. Oh, never mind.",
        "Noelle: Hey, you.",
        "Gigi: Shane, wait. Shane, wait. Honey, I'm here. I -- I will always be here. You know that, right? I've never left you, and I never will.",
        "Shane: You're up at this cabin, aren't you? That's not leaving?",
        "Gigi: We've talked about this. Mom just needs a little time-out.",
        "Shane: To hook up with Schuyler?",
        "Gigi: Is what your dad said?",
        "Shane: No. But I'm not stupid. Are you gonna dump Dad?",
        "Gigi: Honey -- no matter what happens, nobody is getting dumped, especially you. We are a family, okay? We're tight.",
        "Shane: I'm gonna go snowboard.",
        "Gigi: Ooh, can I come?",
        "Shane: Like I can stop you?",
        "Noelle: Shane, uh, why don't you go ahead? Your mom and I need to have a cup of tea first.",
        "Shane: Whatever.",
        "Gigi: I'll make you some hot cocoa.",
        "[Noelle sighs]",
        "Noelle: Oh, Geeg, he is just being a kid. Do not let this upset you.",
        "Gigi: Why not? Oh, God, I'm a rotten person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Boy, I take one day off, and all hell breaks loose.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Well, it's a trial separation. He asked her to leave to figure out what she wants.",
        "Rachel: Don't you mean \"who\" she wants?",
        "Schuyler: I'm -- I'm dressed. I wasn't there. I don't know exactly what was said, but I think he figured she needed time off to, you know, get her head straight after a year of hell.",
        "Rachel: Smart guy.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah? I still think he's a jerk.",
        "Rachel: Still --",
        "Schuyler: I know. Okay? I know.",
        "Rachel: So this Gigi-time-apart, does that include time spent with you?",

        "Bo: Excuse me for one second, please?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Come on. We'll go outside.",
        "Bo: Buchanan.",
        "Oliver: Commissioner? It's Officer Fish. I'm on duty at the hospital right now guarding Mitch Laurence.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I know, Fish. Is there a problem?",
        "Oliver: Well, Rex Balsom is here, and he wants to see the prisoner. He says that Laurence is his father?",
        "Bo: Put him on. Balsom, what the hell is going on?",
        "Rex: I need 2 minutes. That's all.",
        "Bo: For what?",
        "Rex: Fish can search me. I don't have a weapon. I'm not here to hurt anyone.",
        "Bo: Nothing good can come out of this.",
        "Rex: I have a right to see him as next of kin.",
        "Bo: Don't go all legal on me, Balsom. Look, I'm worried about you.",
        "Rex: I will be okay. Mitch will not get to me. I promise.",
        "Bo: Put Fish back on. Yeah, Fish, go ahead and let him in. But you keep an ear out, okay?",
        "Oliver: Will do, sir. You can go in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So, uh, what do you think, Bo? You already have my statement. Do we need to put Natalie through this again?",
        "Bo: Case closed?",
        "Nora: Well, I guess so, as far as the D.A.'s office is concerned, since I.A. is not bringing any charges up.",
        "Natalie: So what happens to Mitch now?",
        "Bo: Well, we're gonna keep working on it.",
        "Natalie: You're gonna let him go, aren't you?",
        "Bo: No. Not if we can find anything against him.",
        "Natalie: Dad said that he might walk. I mean, that's what somebody told him. And -- okay. So Mitch walks. What then? I mean, what -- what's gonna happen if he gets out of jail?",
        "Bo: Natalie, you will have protection.",
        "Nora: Sweetheart, we're not gonna let anyone hurt you.",
        "Natalie: No! I'm not the only one he could hurt. He could go after John or Jessica.",
        "John: Hey, hey. Don't worry about me, all right? I'll -- I'll be fine. What do you say we get a cup of coffee? Yeah? Okay, we're just -- we're gonna get a cup of coffee, okay?",
        "Bo: Okay. What's wrong with my coffee?",
        "Nora: Do you think we're getting the real story about this stabbing?",
        "Bo: No. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I have to confirm that, um, this evidence is real.",
        "Mitch: You have my word.",
        "Dorian: You're asking me to fire one of the most popular police commissioners in the state's history. I have to be really sure before I make a move.",
        "Mitch: Do it today.",
        "Dorian: Be reasonable. It's a holiday.",
        "Mitch: Exactly. New Year's Eve can be so dangerous, especially for your girls. You have until midnight.",
        "Mitch: Hello, son. I've been expecting you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I need a deeper moat.",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry to barge in, but this is important.",
        "Clint: To you?",
        "Dorian: To you, and to all of Llanview. There's a scandal brewing that if it isn't squelched could do a great deal of damage. Please tell me this is some cheesy, doctored-up photo.",
        "Clint: I wish I could. Where did you get this?",
        "Dorian: It was sent to me anonymously.",
        "Clint: This was the night of the party up at the cabin.",
        "Dorian: So it's true?",
        "Clint: Don't even pretend to be sad, Dorian. You're just here to gloat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You know, something was off with Natalie.",
        "Nora: No. She didn't -- she didn't seem scared that Mitch would come after her.",
        "Bo: No, it's more than that. You know, she kept bringing up that he might go after John. Do we want to know why?",
        "Nora: No. Because I wouldn't find any story of Mitch Laurence's credible.",
        "Bo: Okay. Do you think that John could stab Laurence?",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Bo: Do you believe that Laurence stabbed himself?",
        "Nora: I am willing to take John's statement at face value, unless you give me reason not to. And please, God, don't give me reason not to.",
        "Bo: No, no. I don't think it's the best use of department resources to waste a lot of time trying to smear a good cop.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I know. We should just focus on finding ways to keep Laurence locked up instead.",
        "Bo: All right. I'm willing to go through both the Landers and the Stuart murders as long as it takes for us to find a connection to Laurence. What?",
        "Nora: When Natalie walked in here, I thought she was coming here to chew us out for breaking her daddy's heart.",
        "Bo: She must not know.",
        "Nora: Why hasn't Clint told her? I mean, what's he waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: This just gives you happy feet, doesn't it?",
        "Dorian: I beg your pardon?",
        "Clint: If you're still a fake Buddhist, you could call it karma; what goes around comes around.",
        "Dorian: I'm not at all happy about this.",
        "Clint: Then you're slipping.",
        "Dorian: I was hoping it was a lie. It would give me much better options.",
        "Clint: Really? Why?",
        "Dorian: Well, I mean, really. My police commissioner in a lip lock with my district attorney, who happens to be married to said police commissioner's brother. I don't want or need a scandal like this. I just became mayor.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Those selfish fools. What are they thinking, when this is all about you?",
        "Dorian: No! What am I gonna do about it? I have to go to the mayor's ball tonight. I was going to publicly endorse Bo. I was gonna stand behind his whole department.",
        "Clint: Might want to make some rewrites in that speech.",
        "Dorian: What would you do?",
        "Clint: I'd fire Bo's ass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You got to stop doing this.",
        "Natalie: I'm not letting you take the heat for me.",
        "John: There's no heat. No one believes Laurence, and the evidence backs me up.",
        "Natalie: Because you framed him.",
        "John: He can't prove that.",
        "Natalie: And what if the weapon turns up, John?",
        "John: Let it go. Okay? It's over.",
        "Natalie: It's not over. It's never gonna be over. Not as long as that monster's still alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I have one thing to say. If you come near Natalie at all for any --",
        "Mitch: Son, it's very good to see you.",
        "Rex: Don't call me that, and leave Natalie out of this.",
        "Mitch: Out of what?",
        "Rex: What happened to you.",
        "Mitch: Oh. The stabbing, the attempt on my life.",
        "Rex: You tried to kill yourself.",
        "Mitch: You look like such an intelligent young man.",
        "Rex: Stick to that story, Mitch.",
        "Mitch: No one would believe such stupidity. John McBain tried to kill me.",
        "Rex: If you keep saying that, Natalie will.",
        "Mitch: Son, you don't need to worry.",
        "Rex: I am not your son!",
        "Mitch: We will take Natalie with us.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Mitch: When we leave here. When I leave, you will leave with me. I'll be checking out very soon.",
        "Rex: You are truly nuts.",
        "Mitch: No, no, no, not at all. I want you and my grandchild to come with me. My followers are very --",
        "Rex: You will never lay eyes on Shane --",
        "Mitch: No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about the innocent: The baby that you have on the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You see, Mitch has followers.",
        "Kim: Stop.",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah. And they live on a compound, and he's just positive they're going back there.",
        "Kim: Good luck with that.",
        "Stacy: I don't know, but I believe him, Kimmy. There's just -- there's something about him. He's so powerful. He says his grandkid will bring hope to the flock.",
        "Kim: Like a human Simba? Ugh.",
        "Stacy: Oh, girl, it's not that cuddly. Believe me, it's way --",
        "Kim: Creepy?",
        "Stacy: Yeah.",
        "Kim: Well, why can't he take Shane?",
        "Stacy: That's exactly what I said. But I guess he needs, like, a fresh kid so he can raise him in his image.",
        "Kim: Rex's baby.",
        "Stacy: Yeah.",
        "Kim: What a sick twist. So did you say \"yes\"?",
        "Stacy: Well, he isn't a guy that takes \"no\" real well.",
        "Kim: But how does it even work? I mean, if you give him the baby, how does that get you Rex?",
        "Stacy: I don't know. I mean, Fish came in before I even got the details.",
        "Kim: The real baby daddy? Ohh! That must've been interesting.",
        "Stacy: Mitch swore he could make it work.",
        "Kim: I don't know, Stacy. This is way too dangerous. I mean, what if this nut job finds out that this \"chosen one\" of his isn't actually Rex's kid?",
        "Stacy: No, but I have those blood samples. I can get by on any test.",
        "Kim: I don't know.",
        "Stacy: What if he could really get me Rex?",
        "Kim: You have to be smart. Okay? Don't buy into promises. Just tell him that you'll give him the baby only after he gives you Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You don't approve?",
        "Rachel: It's not my place to say.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Don't -- don't do the counselor thing right now. Let me have my friend Rachel. Come on.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, my God! What aren't you telling me?",
        "Rachel: You know what's bugging me.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Rachel: You guess? Gigi's sister is pregnant with your baby, and you still haven't told her, have you?",
        "Schuyler: Well, Rachel, does that sound like a Christmas tree conversation to you? It's not the right time.",
        "Rachel: Then when will it be? In the delivery room, or when the kid turns 5 and looks exactly like you?",
        "Schuyler: When Gigi loves me more than she'll hate what I did. When Gigi loves me half as much as I love her, then it'll be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It's weird. You know, I've never had options. It -- it was always Shane. He was numbers one through 10.",
        "Noelle: Well, like I said, you're a good mama.",
        "Gigi: I don't know about that. But I was there. It was Shane and me, and that was all I needed, except for his daddy. So I thought.",
        "Noelle: And what about now? Do you know what you want?",
        "Gigi: I want Schuyler.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
        "Bo: Well, Clint let us both have it.",
        "Nora: Oh, and you think that was it? Oh, please. He threatened to kill you.",
        "Bo: No, I don't think that gun was loaded.",
        "Nora: Okay, could you just think about what you said for a minute? Have you ever seen your brother like this before? Because I haven't.",
        "Bo: No, I haven't either.",
        "Nora: He's out for blood, Bo. Our blood: Yours and mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You would fire your own brother?",
        "Clint: I'd fire Nora, too, if I could. Too bad she's an elected official.",
        "Dorian: You're just pissed off.",
        "Clint: Picked up on that, did you?",
        "Dorian: If I go after Bo and Nora on a personal level, I could be accused of being vindictive, couldn't I?",
        "Clint: But he's the police commissioner. She is the district attorney of this city. From this day forward, what would that say to the defendants?",
        "Dorian: That is true. On the other hand, if I just looked away --",
        "Clint: You'd be a dishonest wuss.",
        "Dorian: Just to be clear, if I fire Bo tonight, I won't get any trouble from you or Buchanan Enterprises?",
        "Clint: I'll be in the front row cheering you on.",
        "Dorian: So will all of the media. Bo's very popular with them.",
        "Clint: He won't be once you show them that photograph.",
        "Dorian: But then everybody's gonna know.",
        "Clint: So what? What, am I supposed to be embarrassed? They're the ones who acted like horny teenagers.",
        "Dorian: Will you be there?",
        "Clint: Count on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I just don't know if I could give it up.",
        "Kim: The kid? You never wanted the baby. It was always about Rex.",
        "Stacy: Well, yeah. Before.",
        "Kim: \"Before\"?",
        "Stacy: Kimmy, I can feel it inside of me. I can feel it growing.",
        "Kim: Yeah. \"The miracle of Life\" or whatever.",
        "Stacy: You know, I felt alone my whole life. Now I'm not.",
        "Kim: Okay, are you saying if you could get Rex -- big \"if,\" but if -- you'd really rather have the baby? I mean, it's not even Rex's.",
        "Stacy: But it's mine. I've never had anybody who was mine.",
        "Kim: Oh, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: But, you know, you're right. I mean, how does that work? When the baby disappears, how do I get Rex?",
        "Kim: Well, maybe Mitch tells Rex the baby died.",
        "Stacy: And with the baby gone, how do I keep him?",
        "Kim: You two can grieve together. I don't know. Look, you don't have to decide tonight, right?",
        "Stacy: Well, Mitch does need an answer.",
        "Kim: Then say \"yes.\" See what that gets you.",
        "Stacy: Right.",
        "Kim: Look, I got to run. But, look, you have the baby. That means you have the power. Use it. String him along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Listen to me, you freak. Neither Shane nor my baby will ever come near you.",
        "Mitch: If it makes you feel any better, I don't want Shane. He can stay with his mother.",
        "Rex: This isn't a negotiation.",
        "Mitch: She will never forgive you anyway for sleeping with her sister. She's already moved on.",
        "Rex: You don't know anything about my fam --",
        "Mitch: She doesn't deserve you, Rex. Any woman who would choose a lowlife drug addict over you is a fool, to put it lightly. You're better off without her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: You want Schuyler?",
        "Gigi: I do. At least, I think I do.",
        "Noelle: Are you in love with him?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. I don't know. Um, it's -- it's so different: What I feel.",
        "Noelle: Maybe it's lust.",
        "Gigi: I can say no to lust.",
        "Noelle: Well, Lord knows you've turned men away right and left back in Paris. Rex was your one and only. And sometimes that works, but not very often.",
        "Gigi: I can say that this isn't like me wanting to put another notch in my belt or whatever.",
        "Noelle: Then what, darling?",
        "Gigi: It's Schuyler. It's who he is, how he makes me feel. And I feel horrible for wanting him, but I do.",
        "Noelle: Well, what are you gonna do about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I'm worried about you, Schuyler. You can't start a relationship off with a lie and expect --",
        "Schuyler: I know that Rex slept with Stacy, got her pregnant, and lied about it. I know that that's the big problem with Gigi and Rex.",
        "Rachel: And then Stacy had a miscarriage and used you to get pregnant again.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. But Rex broke Gigi's heart. I mean, he took her for granted.",
        "Rachel: And you're not?",
        "Schuyler: Me? No. I'm good for her. I mean, she's happy when she's with me. I let her be herself.",
        "Rachel: Then she can hear the truth from you.",
        "Schuyler: Soon.",
        "Rachel: Schuyler, come on! You didn't do this willingly! Stacy drugged you, for heaven's sake. She took advantage of you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, because -- yeah, that's a real turn-on. Please. Come on, that makes me look pathetic. Rachel, this is my chance. This. I'm not gonna blow it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: When Rex came back into my life after all those years, I thought that's it. I'll never have to think about any of that stuff again.",
        "Noelle: \"That stuff\"? What, you mean love? Life? Growing apart? Growing together? Growing up?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. All that.",
        "Noelle: Oh, not until you stop breathing, honey. I got married when I was just a kid. I thought it would be forever.",
        "Gigi: What happened?",
        "Noelle: We grew up into different people, and he turned into a no-good bum.",
        "Gigi: That's not Rex.",
        "Noelle: No, but that doesn't mean that he's the guy you waited for either.",
        "Gigi: But he is.",
        "Noelle: Well, maybe then you grew up into somebody different.",
        "Gigi: Or maybe I'm just being stupid and I should go home and shut up.",
        "Noelle: Can you really do that?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Noelle: Honey, you get to find out what you want. You better find out. Because if you don't, you won't be happy no matter which way you jump.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God, I can't believe I'm saying it.",
        "Noelle: What?",
        "Gigi: Um, ahem, maybe Rex isn't, you know, my destiny. Maybe he was just this dream that got too big for life.",
        "Noelle: You know, in the end, he's just a guy.",
        "Gigi: But he's a good guy.",
        "Noelle: He can be a good guy, a great guy. But that still doesn't make him the right guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: You already know in your heart that Gigi is gone. That's why you asked her to leave, to take time to think about what she wants.",
        "Rex: How do you know that?",
        "Mitch: Because I'm your father.",
        "Rex: Where do you get your infor -- is my house bugged?",
        "Mitch: And here's a little free fatherly advice. If the girl says that she needs to \"think about it,\" she's already made up her mind.",
        "Rex: Go to hell.",
        "Mitch: But you can start new, clean. You and your child can come with me, Rex.",
        "Rex: Okay, here's my advice. You stay away from my family, or you will find out just how much I really am your son.",
        "Mitch: Oh, if your surrogate daddy could hear you now. What would Bo Buchanan say?",
        "Rex: He'd understand.",
        "Mitch: He'll be the first to go down, Rex, for poisoning you against me. He's number one on the list.",
        "Oliver: Time's up, Rex.",
        "Mitch: Thanks for coming by, and be sure to come back soon. And -- and, please, next time, bring the new family.",
        "Oliver: You okay? You're not, are you?",
        "Rex: That guy is not human.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Stacy looked the same way when she came out.",
        "Rex: Stacy -- she saw him?",
        "Oliver: Uh, well, I wasn't here. The guard stepped away for literally, like, one minute and she sneaked in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Sorry, boss. I got caught in traffic, but I am ready to -- Clint, where's the legal work you want me to do?",
        "Clint: Forget it. What are you doing tonight?",
        "Kim: I don't know. There's this thing at Ultraviolet, but I'm not really into it.",
        "Clint: Good. Then you're coming with me.",
        "Kim: I am?",
        "Clint: To the mayor's ball. Normally that's as boring as it sounds.",
        "Kim: Are you kidding? It sounds great. I wish I could, but --",
        "Clint: You just told me you didn't have any plans.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but I don't have anything to wear to a ball. I don't want to embarrass you.",
        "Clint: That job's taken. Anyway, don't worry about it. We'll go shopping.",
        "Kim: You gonna turn a pumpkin into a carriage, too?",
        "Clint: Watch me. Nigel? Bring the car around, huh? Ms. Andrews and I are going shopping.",

        "Natalie: So how -- how's Matthew? I heard that he -- he was walking?",
        "Nora: Yes. Yes. He took a few steps.",
        "Natalie: That's great. That's great news. You must be so happy.",
        "Nora: We are.",
        "Natalie: Dad must be impossible to live with, right?",
        "Nora: No. Not at all.",
        "Natalie: Well, I mean, I know that he's the one who found Greg Evans, and I'm sure he's crowing. But this -- this is gonna be an awesome New Year's for your guys.",
        "Nora: Well, we're -- we're looking at the bright spots. Yeah.",
        "Dorian: How lucky! You're all here.",
        "Bo: We're working, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Not for long. Invitations to the mayor's ball tonight. Semiformal attire.",
        "Nora: Tonight?",
        "Dorian: As always, James, mark down all these lovely people as yeses.",
        "James: Mr. And Mrs. Clint Buchanan, Commissioner Bo Buchanan and guest, Lieutenant John McBain and guest.",
        "Nora: Clint doesn't really like these things.",
        "Bo: I don't either. I think we'll pass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I know that I'm rationalizing, okay? I know that. But I also know that I'm right about Rex and Stacy and what happened.",
        "Rachel: So two wrongs --",
        "Schuyler: Maybe none of it's wrong, Rachel. Do you ever think about that? Maybe Rex is supposed to be with Stacy. Maybe I'm supposed to be with Gigi.",
        "Rachel: You think that's up to fate?",
        "Schuyler: Well, I'm -- everything happens for a reason.",
        "Rachel: Can you live with that despite the guilt?",
        "Schuyler: For Gigi? Yeah, I can try.",

        "Noelle: You could call him.",
        "Gigi: It is early. He's probably still home.",
        "Noelle: Schuyler doesn't have a home, honey. Roxy threw him out.",
        "Gigi: Why didn't he tell me?",
        "Noelle: Well, he's a grown man. He probably didn't want you taking him in like a stray puppy.",
        "Gigi: Oh -- honey. Oh, gosh, look at you! Let me warm you up some cocoa.",
        "Shane: It's okay. We have to go.",
        "Noelle: Oh, I promised I'd have him back in time for kickoff.",

        "Stacy: Yes, I know.",
        "Rex: Then why would you go see him?",
        "Stacy: Well, you said he would come after everything he thought was his.",
        "Rex: Yeah. So why did you let him see that you were pregnant with my baby?",
        "Stacy: Rex, he already knew. Yeah. Believe me, it freaked me out, too. It was like he knew what I was gonna say before I even did.",
        "Rex: Yeah. He gets in your head.",
        "Stacy: Well, I'm glad I went over to that hospital. I mean, he was gonna come after me anyway.",
        "Rex: He's in custody.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, but for how long? I mean, he can get out, Rex. I'm just glad I got to warn him.",
        "Rex: You warned Mitch Laurence?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I did. I looked him right in the face and I told him I would die before he came near our baby.",
        "Rex: You didn't have to.",
        "Stacy: No, Rex, you just -- you don't understand. I mean, I love this baby more than anything in this world. I -- ahh!",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Stacy: Oh, my God, I felt it kick! I think he just kicked! I felt it!",
        "Rex: Well, I should hope so. I mean, I read the book. Shouldn't it have been kicking for a few weeks?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Don't look so surprised, you two. This is an annual event.",
        "Bo: Lowell never expected me to be there.",
        "Dorian: This is a new day, a new administration. Besides which, it's a benefit.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, I'll write a check.",
        "Nora: So will I. Big.",
        "Dorian: Bo, everybody is going to be looking to see whether or not we can all work together. So you will be there. And, Nora, you will be there with Clint.",
        "Nora: You know, Dorian, this really isn't a very good time for Clint.",

        "Natalie: Honestly, I don't feel like celebrating anything.",

        "Clint: Oh, no, we won't. Hold onto all of them. They're bound to come in handy.",
