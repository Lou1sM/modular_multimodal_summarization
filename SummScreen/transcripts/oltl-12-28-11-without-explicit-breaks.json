        "Rick tells Starr he isn't accepting Todd's offer of cash in exchange for dropping the charges against her. He says he owns her and that he wants exploit the PR value of her family. She tells him the deal is off and she will call her dad's lawyers to take care of it. He tells her not to waste her time; the contract is airtight. He plays her the edited version of the \"Jailbait\" video, which is quite good, but Starr doesn't like it. Rick tells her it will be huge, she will be huge, he will be huge when she takes him to the top, and he won't consider settling.",
        "Shane is mildly surprised to see his mother come home, but isn't completely convinced it really is her. Once he believes the real Gigi standing in front of him, Shane tells Rex and Gigi that Jack is in jail because of evidence he and Neela procured. He wonders what to do about Jack now that he knows Gigi's lookalike sister Stacy died while trying to kill Gigi. Gigi says the right thing to do is tell the police that she is alive. While Shane goes out to warm up the car, Rex tells Gigi about Aubrey. She encourages him to go see Aubrey while she and Shane go to the police station. Rex calls Aubrey and asks her to come over.",
        "Neela visits Jack in jail and admits that she recorded their conversation when he confessed to killing Gigi because Shane asked her to. He reminds her that she said he could trust her. She says she didn't know him very well when Shane asked her to do it. He says she knew him when she needed help and he hid her to keep Vimal from shipping her back to India. He asks her how she could do this to him. He calls her a backstabbing bitch and orders her to leave. Crying, Neela tells Rama that Jack hates her now. She regrets helping Shane. Rama consoles her little sister-in law, telling her that if Jack goes to prison, it will be because of what he did, not what she did. At the police Station, Todd tells Blair that someone set up Jack but he will make everything right. Tea asks him if he intends to kill the person. Tea explains to Todd and Blair that Neela's tape contains a full confession in Jack's voice. She tells him that she may be able to knock it down to manslaughter since it was accidental, but that it may be hard to argue that there was no premeditation because of Jack's history of bullying Shane. Blair says he is just a boy that made a horrible mistake and wonders if he should have to pay with his life. John McBain interjects that Gigi Morasco paid with hers. John tells Tea that if anyone leans on Neela, he will hold her responsible. She suggests that he get Todd behind bars soon. Todd sees Rama and Neela outside the station and immediately begins harassing Neela. Tea advises Jack not to have any contact with Neela and not to say anything about her because she is going to try to prevent the tape from being admitted into evidence. The door opens. Jack and Tea are shocked to see Shane and Gigi in the doorway."

        "Blair: How's Jack?",
        "Todd: He's hanging in there. I told him it's all gonna be okay. I promised him that I'd make it right. I promise you, too. I'm gonna make this right. We're not gonna lose our little boy.",
        "Blair: What are we gonna do, Todd?",
        "Todd: We'll get Jack out of jail.",
        "Blair: [Scoffs] He's in jail because he confessed and they have it on tape.",
        "Todd: He's in jail because somebody set him up. Nobody messes with one of our kids and gets away with it.",
        "[Beeping]",
        "Rick: Nurse! Nurse! Good morning, starshine.",
        "Starr: It's afternoon.",
        "Rick: It's definitely time for a party -- after my sponge bath. Hold the loofah?",
        "Starr: My dad sent you over papers to sign.",
        "Rick: Refresh me.",
        "Starr: You drop the charges, give me back the rights to my music, my dad gives you a huge chunk of change.",
        "Rick: Oh, right, right, right. No can do.",
        "Aubrey: Hey! So glad you got my text. I want to help.",
        "Rama: With what?",
        "Aubrey: I saw the paper. I know that Neela really cares about Jack, so when I realized that he was arrested last night --",
        "Rama: He was arrested because of Neela.",
        "Jack: I am so glad you came.",
        "Neela: I had to.",
        "Jack: Todd just told me there's a tape of me admitting what I did to Shane's mom. Somebody trapped me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Neela Patel? Vimal's little sister made that recording? What'd you threaten to do, detective? Deport her?",
        "John: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: If you had anything to do with that tape, that's entrapment, all right?",
        "John: I already told you. We had no part in it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Neela likes Jack. She would never have volunteered to set him up, okay?",
        "John: Okay. This is between you and me. Shane asked her to help him. Shane believes Jack got away with murder. Apparently, he's right.",
        "Shane: Mom?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's me.",
        "Shane: No. This isn't real. It can't be.",
        "Rex: This is real.",
        "Shane: No. Mom's dead. Grandpa Clint has her heart. This is aunt Stacy.",
        "Rex: No, Shane. Your aunt Stacy's the one who died. This is your mom. I promise.",
        "Shane: Mommy? [Sobs] You're back? You're really here?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Yeah, I am. Look at your hair. Can you see?",
        "Rex: You are back.",
        "Shane: I missed you so much.",
        "Gigi: I-I missed you, too, baby. I-I am so sorry. I-I can't believe what you've been through.",
        "Shane: What happened to you?",
        "Gigi: God.",
        "Shane: Where have you been?",
        "Todd: I'll figure out who tricked our son into confessing. And when I do --",
        "T\u00e9a: What will you do, Todd? Kill them? You would, wouldn't you?",
        "Starr: What is the matter with you, rick? I thought that was a very generous settlement.",
        "Rick: I thought your dad said he wanted to handle things between us.",
        "Starr: Well, he's a little busy, so I figured I could take care of it myself.",
        "Rick: I bet you would.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: So, here is the scoop, baby. I appreciate a man who knows his zeroes, but, see, I still want to work with you. I'm gonna ride those bad-girl coattails straight to the top of the charts.",
        "Starr: Find another bad girl.",
        "Rick: There is no other bad girl for me. See, here's the thing. I own you. Musically speaking. Your buddy, Baz, signed an iron-clad contract.",
        "Starr: Right, and Baz left, which you should follow his lead. Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere, so save your breath and your daddy's legal fees.",
        "Todd: What's with you? You think I'd kill someone?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. I do.",
        "Todd: It's a figure of speech.",
        "John: Right. It's the wrong place for that. And if you really want to help Jack, this is not the way to do it.",
        "T\u00e9a: McBain's right.",
        "Blair: Okay, but you know what? Why don't you tell us what we can do to help, 'cause we're right here. Please, talk to us.",
        "T\u00e9a: There's a tape, okay?",
        "Todd: The tape is a fake. Isn't that right, John?",
        "John: I wouldn't count on it. It looks pretty legit to me.",
        "Blair: Well, then where did it come from? Isn't that the point? W-who made it?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Who is it that can't wait to see our son behind bars?",
        "Rama: Neela agreed to help Shane. She got Jack to talk about Gigi's death and then recorded it.",
        "Aubrey: She went through with it?",
        "Rama: You knew about this plan?",
        "Aubrey: Why do you think I was warning you to keep Neela away from Jack?",
        "Rama: Aubrey Wentworth, you could have been more specific.",
        "Aubrey: Well, I was sworn to secrecy.",
        "Rama: By a teenage boy?",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, by a teenage boy who wants some justice for his mother's death. So, yeah, I-I kept his secret. I didn't think Neela would actually go through with it.",
        "Rama: God, I wish she hadn't.",
        "Aubrey: She did the right thing.",
        "Rama: Probably so, but I just can't help feeling that Neela's the one who will get hurt in the end. Oh! I just wish she hadn't made that tape!",
        "John: Hey, you know, instead of being so worried about how to weasel your way out of this, you might be more concerned about the contents of that tape, you know, where your son admits to killing a woman?",
        "Todd: So you're not gonna give us a name?",
        "Blair: We have a right to know this, John! Don't we, T\u00e9a? Come on.",
        "T\u00e9a: McBain is right. We should worry more about what's on the tape, all right?",
        "Blair: Well, who is it? Won't you tell me? Who is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Neela Patel.",
        "Todd: His girlfriend? Her brother, Vimal, works for me.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. This is gonna break Jack's heart on top of everything else.",
        "Todd: I practically bought out little India so they could spend time together in my office. She set him up while they were on my dime?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, no one's ever accused you of good judgment.",
        "Todd: What the hell is your problem? Why are you on my case? Jack's the one who's in trouble here, not me.",
        "Jack: The cops must have bugged Todd's office. That's the only way they could have got me talking about that stuff.",
        "Neela: No, it's not.",
        "Jack: Trust me, I don't talk about Shane or his mom to anyone, ever. That time with you was it. You're probably gonna need a lawyer.",
        "Neela: What?",
        "Jack: Maybe your brother has one? Or Todd could help.",
        "Neela: Why would I need a lawyer?",
        "Jack: Because the LPD hates my family. Ask T\u00e9a, my dad's wife. She's a lawyer. She'll tell you.",
        "Neela: Jack, listen...",
        "Jack: Look, I know it sounds crazy. You didn't do anything. But the cops could still charge you as an accessory because you didn't tell them as soon as you found out what I did.",
        "Neela: I don't need a lawyer.",
        "Jack: Why? What are you talking about?",
        "Neela: Jack, when you confessed that you killed Shane's mom... I recorded it. It was me.",
        "Gigi: And I could not remember any of it until your dad found me at the bon jour.",
        "Shane: After we all left? Dad, what if you didn't go back?",
        "Rex: Okay, I'm not thinking about that.",
        "Gigi: I was meant to get back to you, honey.",
        "Shane: So you were just around that whole time?",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm. After I got out of that hospital.",
        "Shane: And then you came to see us?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. And I -- and I knew that you were important to me, but it's like...it's like my heart remembered, you know, and my brain couldn't.",
        "Shane: I couldn't say goodbye to you. I tried to right before the heart transplant, but... that wasn't you.",
        "Gigi: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Rex: It was aunt Stacy.",
        "Shane: I-I...",
        "Gigi: Oh, honey, you know, I am so sorry for what you went through. That is the first thing I would have changed if I could, but I couldn't. I was so totally out of it.",
        "Shane: It's okay.",
        "Gigi: It's not okay. But you know what? We are going to make it all better.",
        "Shane: I can't believe I'm actually looking at you.",
        "Gigi: I-I have been away from you for way too long. I want to know everything you did. I want to know everything you thought about. I want to know everything.",
        "Shane: Well, that's easy. Payback. All I cared about was making Jack man-- you're alive!",
        "Rex: I keep doing that, too.",
        "Shane: No. Mom's alive. That means Jack Manning didn't kill her.",
        "Starr: You want to control me?",
        "Rick: Well, when you put it that way...",
        "Starr: You're a sleaze.",
        "Rick: Keep going.",
        "Starr: Let me put it in terms that you may understand, rick. There are a lot of singers out there. I'm sure you can find another good one in five minutes.",
        "Rick: Probably, but that doesn't matter.",
        "Starr: Being a good singer doesn't matter?",
        "Rick: It helps.",
        "Starr: What does?",
        "Rick: \"It.\"",
        "Starr: \"It.\" What's \"it\"?",
        "Rick: I can't define \"it,\" but I know \"it\" when I see \"it.\"",
        "Starr: And I've got \"it\"?",
        "Rick: Are you kidding? You are oozing it! You have a totally sordid past, a very exploitable camera-ready family, and your own tabloid newspaper. I mean, that is just the beginning! Come on, Starr! You got evil-twin daddies. You got the murdered brainwashed one. I mean, that would be good enough in itself. But for a bonus, you have the matricidal rapist. And this morning, your murderous brother is all over the news. Who are the Kardashians? I mean, your family's a P.R. Gold mine!",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Blair: I don't know what's going on between the two of you, but why don't you just cut it out and let's focus on Jack right now? John, how can you use the tape if you don't know how it was made? Huh?",
        "John: I think you should listen to your lawyer. We know how the tape was made. Blair, we have a signed statement. The D.A.'S office is confident the tape's solid.",
        "Todd: Does the D.A.'s office know that -- that he was set up?",
        "Blair: Uh, yeah. That can't be legal, right, T\u00e9a? I...",
        "John: I will give you some time with your clients.",
        "Todd: Delgado, you got to get this tape thrown out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. If they can prove that that's Jack's voice on the tape, then it'll come in. It's a full confession in the defendant's own words. Jack could be in big trouble.",
        "Aubrey: You're right. Neela's in a terrible position. But at least she found out the truth about Jack.",
        "Rama: She feels so bad for him.",
        "Aubrey: Why? She understands what he did, right?",
        "Rama: Yeah, but he's so remorseful, Aubrey.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, please. Not you, too. That kid deserves to be locked up. And he will be for a very long time, so she'll have plenty of time to get over him.",
        "Rama: Unless she can't. Unless she feels so guilty about putting him in jail that she just cannot get over him.",
        "Aubrey: You really think that will happen?",
        "Rama: I don't know. It's just clear that whatever Jack has done, Neela still has feelings for him.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Jack didn't kill your mom.",
        "Gigi: Your dad told me that that weasel got away with what he did.",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: I don't blame you for being mad. I-it would have made me crazy, too. But it's over now, babe.",
        "Shane: No, it's not.",
        "Gigi: We need to forget all about Jack Manning.",
        "Shane: Jack's in jail.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Shane: That's what I was trying to tell you before mom came in. You know, my big news.",
        "Rex: Jack Manning is in jail? The cops finally got some evidence?",
        "Shane: I did. It was me. And someone else helped.",
        "Jack: I don't understand. What are you talking about?",
        "Neela: When you told me what happened to Shane's mom, I recorded it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you just said that.",
        "Neela: I had a tape recorder in my purse, Jack.",
        "Jack: Wait. You're serious?",
        "Neela: [Sighs] Yes.",
        "Jack: Why would you do that to me?",
        "Neela: I wanted you to confess -- for Shane.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Neela: [Sighs] Because he asked me to.",
        "Shane: I was hoping Neela would get something on tape, but Jack ended up spilling everything.",
        "Rex: You're kidding.",
        "Shane: No. He admitted all of it. Neela gave me the tape, I handed it over to John McBain, and then they arrested him.",
        "Gigi: Wow.",
        "Rex: So, you seriously got Jack to confess? I mean, nobody else could get that kid to crack.",
        "Shane: Well, it was really Neela.",
        "Rex: B-but -- unh-unh. No. You are taking the credit for this, okay? This is a great Christmas present, Shane, way better than anything anybody could buy in an airport.",
        "Gigi: Definitely.",
        "Shane: Yeah, I thought so. But...you're really alive, and that's, like, the best present ever. Except...",
        "Rex: Except?",
        "Shane: What happens now?",
        "Rick: And that is just the criminal aspect of your family! The kinky part -- whoo! That's even better!",
        "Starr: My family's not kinky.",
        "Rick: Two sisters dating two brothers. That's it. Let the man-stealing begin.",
        "Starr: For the last time, rick, I'm not pretending to sleep with my sister's boyfriend!",
        "Rick: I'll handle that part.",
        "Starr: Why can't it just be about music?",
        "Rick: Oh, you are so sweet. Honey, come on. It has never been about the music. I mean, ever since Elvis, I mean, he was marketed. I mean, everyone's always got an angle. It's okay. Y-you don't want to steal Dani's boyfriend, then we'll just focus on your brother's murder charge.",
        "Starr: Really, rick? I'm seriously worried about my brother. He's in trouble.",
        "Rick: And we're going to use it. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Starr: Yes, there is something wrong with that, rick. Everything you say is completely disgusting, and you are a pathetic excuse for a human being!",
        "Rick: Oh, come on! Is that the best you got? \"Disgusting, pathetic.\"",
        "Starr: [Groans]",
        "Rick: We seriously need to work on your expletives, Starr! Oh, good. You have company. We'll do your bath later on.",
        "Rick: No need to wait. My friend here wants to help with all the hard-to-reach areas. Ha. I'll be back later.",
        "Starr: You know what? I'm gonna get going, too.",
        "Rick: You'll be back.",
        "Starr: I won't be back, rick! The deal is off! I am calling my dad's lawyers, and I am making them take care of this!",
        "Rick: Okay. I'll drop the lawsuit.",
        "Starr: [Sighs] That's a start. And?",
        "Rick: And we'll concentrate on making Starr a star.",
        "Starr: When will you get this?",
        "Rick: Maybe when you do. Did you have your lawyers take a look-see at that contract? There's no way out of it. Your career is in my hands. And like I tell all of my actresses, you might as well relax, enjoy it, and most of all, have fun.",
        "Starr: You know what, rick? You're right. I am a bad, bad girl.",
        "Rick: [Screams]",
        "Aubrey: Don't worry. Neela will get over Jack. I'm sure every guy at that school would love a chance to go out with her.",
        "Rama: Ooh, don't say that in front of Vimal, okay?",
        "Aubrey: [Chuckles]",
        "Rama: Okay, so what's going on with you, honey?",
        "Aubrey: Me?",
        "Rama: Yeah, what happened with Rex? Did he come home?",
        "Aubrey: Not for Christmas. There was some freak snowstorm in Texas, so he got stuck. He left me a message. He should be on his way home now.",
        "Rama: Okay, so that's good, yeah?",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, I guess. It's just...he sounded strange.",
        "Rama: Strange? How?",
        "Aubrey: Just...strange. Like he's not telling me something.",
        "Gigi: Well, I'm definitely alive, which means Jack Manning did not kill me.",
        "Shane: So, did he kill aunt Stacy?",
        "Gigi: No, my poor sister, rest her soul.",
        "Rex: Your poor sister? You're kidding, right?",
        "Gigi: She died, Rex.",
        "Rex: Stacy was gonna kill you. She tried to.",
        "Shane: I still can't believe it.",
        "Gigi: Well, don't think about it.",
        "Shane: I'm just glad you're alive.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, me too. It's all over now!",
        "Shane: But it's not. What do we do about Jack?",
        "Jack: You set me up because Shane Morasco asked you to?",
        "Neela: I didn't want to believe it was true.",
        "Jack: I asked if I could trust you. You swore to me that I could.",
        "Neela: I didn't know what you would say. And I wasn't even sure I should make the tape. And I almost didn't give it to Shane.",
        "Jack: But you did.",
        "Neela: But I told him I knew how sorry you were for what you've done.",
        "Jack: How could you do this to me?",
        "Neela: Because... when Shane asked me, I didn't really know you. And when he told me about what happened to his mother, I felt so terrible for him. And then he told me that you were responsible and that -- that another boy was in jail because of you.",
        "Jack: I could go to jail for the rest of my life. How could you do this to me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe if Jack shows remorse, I'll argue the accidental nature of the death. That could knock it down to manslaughter with the right judge or A.D.A.",
        "Todd: This is how you help?",
        "T\u00e9a: I am playing with the hand we've been dealt. Given the history of Jack's bullying of Shane, it's very hard to argue no premeditated intent to harm. Jack could be facing a murder charge.",
        "Todd: And what's it? This is all you have?",
        "Blair: He's just a boy! He's my boy! I mean, h-he made a horrible mistake, yes, but should he have to pay with his life, T\u00e9a?",
        "John: Like Gigi Morasco did?",
        "Rex: Well, what should we do about Jack?",
        "Gigi: [Chuckles] I'm just still impressed that our son finally got that jerk to own up to what he did.",
        "Shane: Yeah, what I thought he did.",
        "Gigi: Still proud. But you're right. Things have changed, so... the right thing to do would be to go to the police station and tell them I'm alive.",
        "Jack: You didn't know me? I'm the guy who hid you at my house when your brother was looking to ship you back to India. You knew me when you needed help!",
        "Neela: Jack, please, I will always be grateful for that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, right. So, what's the deal? You got what you wanted. Who cares?",

        "Rama: Come on, Aubrey. Don't make too much of what happened with Rex.",
        "Aubrey: Something's off.",
        "Rama: Yeah, of course something's off. He spent his first Christmas without the woman he planned to marry.",
        "Aubrey: I know, but he just seemed so determined to have a good holiday anyway.",
        "Rama: And then he got stuck at the airport. Of course he's gonna be off.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, you're right. I'm making too much of it. Unless I'm not.",
        "Rama: Just wait till you see him and then you'll know.",
        "Aubrey: True. I just can't wait.",
        "Rama: Well, then call him.",
        "Aubrey: I shouldn't.",
        "Rama: Well, he left you a message, right? You can call him back. Is he home yet?",

        "Gigi: Okay, Balsom, I just came back from the dead, so whatever this is, it has to be easier than that.",
        "Rex: It's not a big deal. There's not much to say.",
        "Gigi: About Aubrey?",
        "Rex: Yeah, we got... a little close. She helped out with Shane.",
        "Gigi: On Halloween?",
        "Rex: Yeah, she planned this whole thing for Natalie, and after that... I mean, she wasn't in our lives before. You know, with everybody else, all I could think about was you.",
        "Gigi: So, with her, you forgot?",
        "Rex: No. Way. It was just... easier. I mean, I went to Texas to stay goodbye to you.",
        "Gigi: I know. You don't have to feel bad about that.",
        "Rex: [Sighs] I didn't expect to bring you home. Aubrey was supposed to spend Christmas with me and Shane.",
        "Gigi: Have you spoken with her since you found me?",
        "Rex: Uh, not really. She has no idea.",
        "Gigi: Do you have feelings for her?",
        "Rex: If I did, they disappeared the minute I knew you were back.",
        "Gigi: Okay. I understand. I... you thought I was dead. Things happen. But I-I'm gonna need you to tell me the whole truth.",
        "Rex: I am. I...\"cared\" about Aubrey. But it was nothing like it is with you, Morasco. You're it for me, now and forever.",
        "Gigi: Same here, Balsom. But, um, Aubrey's probably sitting there waiting for you to call her back, so just do it. Or go see her.",
        "Rex: I'm not gonna leave you.",
        "Gigi: Shane and I can go to the police station. We can meet up after.",
        "Rex: [Sighs] A-are you sure?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Balsom, I'm never gonna go anywhere ever again. I promise.",
        "Rama: Oh, come on, Aubrey. You don't know what it means.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, you're right. Maybe Rex is still on the plane or maybe his battery died.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Aubrey: Or maybe he's calling me back right now. Hi, Rex.",
        "Rex: Hey, sorry I missed your call. I was, uh...",

        "T\u00e9a: I want to get Jack arraigned, all right? And then we can find out about bail.",
        "Todd: Okay.",

        "Blair: I can't let Sam see me like this. I don't even know what to say to that boy.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, well, uh, go take a walk, uh, go to the gym, do whatever will make you feel better.",

        "Neela: Yes, I do. I just saw him.",
        "Rama: You went to jail? You told me you were going to the library. I would have never let you go!",
        "Neela: I know. That's why I lied. I'm so sorry.",
        "Rama: Okay, tell me what happened.",
        "Neela: [Sniffles] Jack was so angry and so hurt. He trusted me. And I betrayed him. He'll never speak to me again.",
        "Rama: Okay, may-- maybe that's for the best.",
        "Neela: [Sniffles] How can you say that?",
        "Rama: Because Jack could probably be in jail for the rest of his life.",
        "Neela: And it's all my fault.",

        "Starr: You touch me again ever like that, I will break your leg!",

That's -- that's what I'm talking about. That's -- that's the stuff that -- that we had in that video. Here. Here.",

        "Starr: Check what out?",
        "Rick: It's the edited version.",

        "Rick: Hmm. Ah. That's brilliant, huh?",
        "Starr: \"Brilliant's\" not exactly what I'd call it.",

        "Starr: It's going to bomb. There's no way \"jailbait\" is going to be a hit.",
        "Rick: Oh, come on! Where is your can-do spirit? Besides, no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.",
        "Starr: But you're taking a really big chance, Rick. I mean, the settlement's a sure thing.",
        "Rick: What good's money if nobody knows who I am?",
        "Starr: Is that really all you want?",
        "Rick: You were born famous, kid. You have no idea what it's like for people to look right through you.",
        "Starr: No one could ever look right through you.",
        "Rick: And I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna be huge. My name will be a household word. And you're gonna take me there. You're gonna take me all the way to the top.",

        "Rick: Hey, uh, one question. Would you see a movie called \"hold the catheter\"? Ah! I got you! You know what? I'm just gonna stick with loofah. One more thing. You manhandle me again like that, and you will regret it.",
        "John: The guard is bringing Jack up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "John: You okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] I've been better, but don't worry. I'm not gonna let Todd know that we think he's a killer.",
        "John: Close the door, will you? On a side note, if I hear about anybody leaning on the Patel girl, I'm holding you responsible.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine.",
        "John: You sure you can handle this? You're probably gonna be dealing with Manning a lot.",
        "T\u00e9a: Unless you have the evidence to lock him up for Victor's murder today.",
        "John: We're working on it.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, Jack's the one who was always sure that Todd killed Victor. Turns out, he was right all along.",

        "John: Come on in! Hey, Jack. All right, counselor. Well, I'll let you use this office for a meeting with your client.",

        "John: That'd be a hoot.",
        "Jack: [Sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: How you doing, Jack? How was your night last night?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, uh, first thing, I'm gonna try to get you out on bail, all right? You look upset.",
        "Jack: I'm fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen to me. I'm gonna do everything I can to keep you out of prison. Now, you know I wasn't on board with everything Victor did to try to cover this up before, but that does not mean I want you in jail, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: All right. But first, you and I, we have a-a tough case to fight.",
        "Jack: Right. Thanks to my friend, Neela. I can't believe I trusted her. How could I be so stupid?",
        "Rama: Neela, if Jack Manning goes to prison, it's because of what he did, okay, not because of what you did. You know that, right? I'm sorry it was so hard to see Jack.",
        "Neela: I will never forget the look on his face.",
        "Rama: You still care about him?",
        "Neela: And he'll never speak to me again, thanks to Shane Morasco.",
        "Rama: Now, Shane's a nice boy.",
        "Neela: His stupid plan ruined everything! Why did I do it?",
        "Rama: You wanted to help.",
        "Neela: I was so worried... ...that he might go and try to commit suicide again.",
        "Rama: What?!",
        "Neela: He was so upset, and I felt so sorry that his mother was dead. But this isn't going to bring her back to life!",
        "Rama: Neela.",
        "Neela: This had nothing to do with me. I shouldn't have gone along with it. If that woman hadn't died, I wouldn't be in this mess!",
        "Shane: Can I least drive you down the driveway?",
        "Gigi: No way.",
        "Shane: Why not?",
        "Gigi: Because you don't have a permit. Do you?",
        "Shane: [Chuckles] I will soon. Come on. Dad lets me do it sometimes.",
        "Gigi: Oh, he does?",
        "Rex: Thanks, pal!",
        "Gigi: What else went on here without me? Do I even want to ask how many pizzas were ordered?",
        "Shane: There might have been one or two.",
        "Gigi: I can't believe how big you've gotten.",
        "Shane: You know my feet can reach the foot pedals, right?",
        "Gigi: Mnh-mnh. Not without a permit. I just got back. I'm not taking any chances.",
        "Rex: Sounds like a plan.",

        "Rex: Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm. I have this, um, very tall, handsome, very grown-up gentleman escorting me. We will be fine. Besides, what you have to do can't wait.",
        "Rama: Now you're blaming a poor dead woman for all your problems?",
        "Neela: You know what I mean, Rama.",
        "Rama: Listen, the only person to blame is Jack Manning, okay? He's responsible for what he did. This is not your fault. This is karma. Actions have consequences.",
        "Todd: Well, look who it is. Neela Patel. If it isn't Llanview police department's newest little helper.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. Is that a threat?",
        "Rick: No, no, no, no. I mean, it's just a gentle reminder. You work for me, not the other way around.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: The sooner you get used to it, the better. So, come on. Don't be upset. We are gonna make beautiful music together.",
        "Aubrey: [Sighs] Hey! Welcome home! It's so good to see... I didn't put that up at first. I didn't know if you would like it or if it would make things worse. But then I thought, you and Shane think about Gigi all the time. I mean, you miss her no matter what. And I am not trying to take her place, and I know you know that, but I just had to say...a lot, apparently. I will shut up now. I'm just so happy that you're home. [Chuckles]",
        "Rex: Aubrey, there's... something I need to tell you.",
        "Rama: Hello, Mr. Manning. Ms. Cramer.",
        "Blair: Hello. Come on. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Todd: Look at you. Do you have any idea what you've done? Do you realize our son is in jail because of you?",
        "Blair: This is not the time, Todd. Come on.",
        "Todd: Was it fun? Did you like it, playing amateur spy? Make you all tingly on the inside?",
        "Rama: Mr. Manning, please.",
        "Todd: Already in this country, what, just a few days, and you're a model American. Your mother must be very proud. We should give you a medal.",
        "Blair: Come on. This is --",

        "Jack: I do now.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know you must be hurt. You're probably furious with her, and I don't blame you. But listen to me carefully. You don't say anything about the girl. You don't say anything to the girl. You have no contact with her. Is that understood?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
