        "Spencer is sleeping. He feels light on his face and wakes to find John in his doorway. \"You are not on my guest list,\" Spencer tells John. John comes deeper into the room and closes the door. John has some cloth and he wraps the fabric around and around his knuckles keeping the piece between the fists tight! \"Guard!\" Spencer shouts, but no one comes. He knows what this is. The boys in blue protect each other and this is part of that. Marty has come to John's room and finds that he isn't there. She asks a nurse where John is but she too has no idea where the man is. Marty is beginning to have a good idea though where John has run off to. Marty gets to Spencer's room in time to find John over Spencer choking the life out of him. Spencer struggles but John is too strong. Marty pulls John off the man and drags him out of the room. The guard comes in and Spencer starts telling how John just tried to kill him. \"What man?\" the guard asks smiling. He walks out. John goes to the stairwell and is trying to climb the stairs. Marty follows him and the door closes behind them. He wants to be left alone but Marty will not leave him. She feels that his behavior must be due to the mixture of drugs that he is taking. He orders to leave him alone and tries to make it up the stairs. He takes two steps and falls to the stairs in pain. He is in bad shape and passes out. When he wakes, he is back in his bed and Marty is standing over him. She tells him that he passed out and that she saw to it that he got back to bed. Todd is with Blair and he talks to her about how sorry he is for all the trouble that he has caused. Bo comes in with Paige and wants to talk to Blair alone. Blair insists that Todd be allowed to stay. She tells Bo that the accident wasn't Todd's fault and that the incident was just an accident. Bo has no choice but to lighten up on his charges. Todd will still be charged with not telling Spencer was hurt and at the scene, and kidnapping Todd pours his heart out not to Blair and asks her if she thinks that they will ever be a couple again. She smiles that that reassures him that everything is going to be okay. At UV, Claudia is supposed to be taking care of the bar, but she has gotten herself into the bottle instead. She calls her sponsor and is driven home. Adriana has her fashion show and Cristian takes pictures as they model at the club. There are guests lined up around the block to get in. Nash takes over with a little help from Rex and things run great! Evangeline sings and brings the crowd into 2007 with a little Boogie, oogie, oogie!"

        "Todd: Hey, honey. I'm back. Sorry I left you. I had to drop jack off at Kyle's. He's going to stay there tonight. Starr's at home. You know, she told me that she doesn't blame me for what happened to you and the baby. It really meant a lot to me. Of course, I think it would mean more if you said it, too. I need to know. I need to know if you blame me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Perfect.",
        "Rex: Well, we beat the crowd, that's for sure.",
        "Adriana: We needed to get here early --",
        "Layla: So everything's ready.",
        "Nash: Ready for what?",
        "Layla: Some of our friends are coming tonight wearing lingerie by exposed.",
        "Adriana: We figured a way to get some free publicity.",
        "Layla: Yeah, Adriana and I are the first models.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Adriana: And it makes its own fashion statement.",
        "Rex: It's saying how awesome you two look.",
        "Layla: Thank you. Well, I can't wait to see how everybody else looks. They should be getting here soon.",

        "Layla: Where's Antonio?",
        "Adriana: Oh, he had some family business, but he should be here later. He left Claudia in charge, but I haven't seen her.",

        "Marty: Oh, Mindy, has John Mc Bain been taken anywhere for tests?",
        "Mindy: On New Year's Eve? No way. We have a skeleton staff, and unless it's urgent -- I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: No, that's ok. I think I know exactly where he went.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Lieutenant? I'm real sorry, but you're not on my guest list. You got to leave. Guard! Oh, I see how this is going down -- boys in blue always protect their own no matter what, right? Oh. What are you doing here, John? Why are you risking your life to be here? What do you want? Answer me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: What happened?",
        "Nash: You passed out. She's fine, all right? She'll be all right. I can handle this. Hey --",
        "Dorian: I better take a look at her -- I'm a doctor.",
        "Nash: Look, she's going to be all right.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I think I better check that she isn't suffering from alcohol poisoning. Ok, everybody, tell you what -- you can go about your business. It's ok. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Ok, the cell phone is turned off. No calls tonight, and I'm not going to think about Spencer -- or Todd.",
        "Cristian: You just did.",
        "Evangeline: Oh. Well, I'm done with that. Tonight I'm just going to think about how happy I am to be here with you.",
        "Cristian: Looking at you in that dress makes me think of how happy I want to make you later.",
        "Evangeline: Oh! Well, that is the idea, isn't it?",
        "Adriana: Cris, did you bring it?",
        "Cristian: Yep -- got it right here.",
        "Adriana: Thank you so much for doing this with us.",

        "Dorian: Whatever you do, don't drive.",

        "Claudia: It's New Year's Eve. Isn't that enough?",
        "Nash: You're plastered. How much did you drink?",
        "Claudia: Uh -- tonight?",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Claudia: Enough.",
        "Nash: Is that the first time?",
        "Claudia: No, no, it's been a couple of weeks, I think.",
        "Nash: Why would you do this, Claudia? Why would you go back to the bottle? You were doing great.",
        "Claudia: Who says I was doing great? My life sucks. I'm stuck in this town with no friends, no you, and -- but where else am I going to go? I mean, I have no friends anywhere, and still no you.",
        "Nash: I thought you understood.",
        "Claudia: I lied. I can never get over losing you to Jessica.",
        "Nash: Tess.",
        "Claudia: Oh, Tess. Jess/Tess, Tess/Jess -- I don't know what I'm saying, I'm so wasted. Hmm.",

        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "Langston: I saw you outside your building. I yelled, but you didn't hear me -- or maybe you did.",
        "Starr: No, I -- I didn't.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: Me, too. Look, I'm sorry I got so mad at you. You were just trying to be a good friend.",
        "Langston: I heard about your mom. Is she ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah -- except for I found out that I was going to be having another little brother. And -- um -- then she lost the baby. She had a miscarriage.",
        "Langston: Oh. That sucks.",
        "Starr: I really missed you.",
        "Langston: I missed you, too.",
        "Starr: So, I guess the pep rally is over?",
        "Langston: Those things blow anyway -- and it's starting to snow on the bonfire.",
        "Starr: Yeah, everybody's probably leaving.",
        "Langston: There's a party at Chloe's later. You want to check it out?",
        "Starr: I'm not really in the mood for a party tonight.",
        "Langston: It'll probably be lame anyway. We could tag Britney's car.",
        "Langston: With everything on them.",
        "Langston: Let's get out of here before the bonfire crowd gets in.",
        "Starr: Yeah, we should go.",
        "Langston: Or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, Blair. And not just for this -- for everything. I'm sorry I couldn't get past what happened with you and Spencer. I couldn't forgive you even though you begged me to. You said you loved me and you never stopped. I understand that now because I never stopped loving you, either. And when I thought I was going to lose you, nothing else mattered. All my anger and all my pain -- I couldn't let go of all those things. I don't think I can let go of you. You said you wanted me to forgive you, I forgive you -- even if you never forgive me. I remember -- oh, god -- two years ago, about this time. When I was with Margaret, I was almost a goner. Then I heard your voice on the television and you sang to me, and you really saved my life that night. You really did. I need you to save my life again, sweetie. I don't deserve your forgiveness. I need it, though. Without you, I'm dead.",
        "Blair: Todd?",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Dude, there's about a hundred people outside waiting to party and nobody running the show.",
        "Nash: Well, I think I can cover for Claudia here.",
        "Claudia: Well, do you have any clue of what to do?",
        "Rex: I took the night off from UV to be a guest, not a host. Layla's busy with exposed, so I might be able to pitch in.",
        "Nash: Great. Well, let's get this party started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Um --",
        "Cristian: That's good.",
        "Dorian: Clearly there has been some mistake.",
        "Adriana: Why? What's going on?",
        "Dorian: Well, the -- the bouncer will not allow the \"craze\" photographer in.",
        "Adriana: Well, he must not be on the list.",
        "Dorian: Oh, Cristian, how would you like to make some money and sell those photographs you're taking to \"Craze\" magazine?",
        "Cristian: Uh -- I can't. I'm already shooting for another magazine -- \"Mania.\" Adriana asked me to.",
        "Layla: Yeah, we're hoping the pictures will end up in \"Mania's\" trends section.",
        "Adriana: And since every woman that Cristian is taking a picture of is wearing our very own exposed --",
        "Layla: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but if all the pictures are going to \"Mania,\" then -- then they're going to scoop us on this very big story.",
        "Adriana: Well, \"Mania's\" bigger, and we'll get more exposure -- plus, they don't like to share.",
        "Dorian: But I'm your mother.",
        "Adriana: It's not personal, it's just business.",
        "Dorian: Where'd you learn that from?",
        "Adriana: From the pro herself.",
        "Dorian: Maybe I taught you too well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You think that Blair's feeling well enough that I could ask her a few questions? Because I'd like to get her statement. Manning's and Truman's stories about what happened up on the warehouse roof -- they don't quite jive.",
        "Paige: So it's up to Blair then to -- to either clear Todd, or condemn him?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: You're awake. You're looking better, getting some color back.",
        "Blair: I feel better.",
        "Todd: Good.",
        "Paige: Hi, Blair. I'm covering for Dr. Lee tonight. How are you feeling?",
        "Blair: I feel better.",
        "Bo: Do you feel like answering a few questions, Blair?",
        "Blair: What do you want to know, Bo?",
        "Bo: Todd, I'm going to have to ask you to step outside.",
        "Blair: Bo -- is it all right if Todd stays?",
        "Bo: Ok. Can you tell me exactly what happened on that warehouse roof that night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: I think your doctors might be interested to know where you are. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing?",
        "John: I think it's called justice.",
        "Spencer: You're insane, man.",
        "John: Just like you, you son of a bitch.",
        "Marty: I need to see Dr. Truman.",
        "Officer: He has already got somebody in there with him.",
        "Marty: Detective Mc Bain?",
        "Officer: Yeah, how'd you know?",
        "Marty: John! John, stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Thank you for watching Bree tonight again --",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Jessica: Both of you.",
        "Viki: Darling, anytime, and I mean that. Go and have a good time.",
        "Jessica: Happy New Year. Happy New Year.",
        "Clint: You know, Jessie just said something very interesting that -- well, look at you.",
        "Viki: Wow!",
        "Natalie: Well, I just figured if John can't come out of the hospital for New Year's, I'll just bring New Year's to him.",
        "Viki: Honey, you look gorgeous.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Clint: You're going to knock out John in that outfit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Agh!",
        "Marty: John! John, stop! Stop it! Spencer, are you ok?",
        "John: I was going --",
        "Marty: Listen to me. Listen to me. We have to get out of here, and we have to get you back to your room, right now. Come on, come on.",
        "Spencer: Guard! That man tried to strangle me! He tried to kill me!",
        "Officer: What man?",
        "Spencer: I'm telling you the truth. John Mc Bain -- he tried to strangle me to death.",
        "Officer: Yeah. Like anybody's going to believe that.",
        "Marty: We need to get you back to your room before anybody sees you. You tried to strangle him.",
        "John: But I don't know why. I don't know why.",
        "Marty: Look, you finally started taking your pain medications, didn't you? Nation of drugs -- You're probably just having a bad interaction.",
        "John: Don't look at me like you know what I'm thinking.",
        "Marty: I know the state of mind you were in the last time I saw you. Look, I am just glad I got to you before you killed Spencer.",
        "John: I'm not. And not even the quack psychiatrist that got him a free pass to the loony bin's going to save him from what he's got coming. I need to find my own way back to my room.",
        "Marty: You're not going anywhere.",
        "John: Who the hell are you anyway, lady?",
        "Marty: Yeah, I'm the quack psychiatrist. I'm Marty Saybrooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: All right, I -- I swear I didn't know you were going to be here.",
        "Starr: I didn't know I was going to be here.",
        "Cole: How's your mom?",
        "Starr: She lost the baby.",
        "Cole: I'm really sorry. I mean, if you -- if there's anything I can do for --",
        "Starr: No, I really don't want to talk about it, ok?",
        "Cole: Yeah, sure.",
        "Starr: So, why did you come in here?",
        "Cole: It just felt really weird out there at the bonfire.",
        "Starr: Because you're not on the team anymore?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I guess. And the championship's tomorrow, and if we don't win, then it's --",
        "Starr: It's not your fault.",
        "Cole: Yeah. But see, well, this team -- this -- this team is -- I mean, there's not going to be another one like it. You know? And this is supposed to be Llanview -- Llanview high's year. I mean, everybody was counting on me, and I let them down. And the guys are not going to forget it.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, the guys are the ones who put you on those steroids.",
        "Cole: You know what? Nobody held a gun to my head. You know? I -- and now coach hates me, and he will never forgive me.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but so what? Maybe he does. But who cares anyway? The only person you need to forgive is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Can you answer some questions about what happened on that roof?",
        "Blair: When I -- ahem -- got to the warehouse, Spencer and Todd were already up on the roof.",
        "Bo: Why did you go to the warehouse?",
        "Blair: I called Todd to tell him about the baby. And he told me where he was. And I -- it just kind of sounded like he was in trouble, but I didn't know just how much until I heard the crash.",
        "Todd: And that was Spencer hitting me with a chair.",
        "Bo: That's enough, Manning. What happened when you got to the roof?",
        "Blair: Spencer was trying to kill Todd. Then Todd finally broke free.",
        "Bo: What happened next?",
        "Bo: Did you see Todd intentionally try to push Truman off that roof? Blair, did Todd try to kill Truman?",
        "Blair: No. It was an accident. It wasn't Todd's fault.",
        "Bo: Blair, are you sure you're telling me everything?",
        "Blair: Yes. I mean, that's it, Bo, and I'm really tired.",
        "Paige: She needs to rest.",
        "Bo: All right. Thank you, Blair.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Bo: Ok, Blair's statement clears you concerning Truman's fall off the roof, but you're still facing charges for kidnapping, obstruction of justice, and not telling the EMTS that Truman was at the scene and severely injured. And that last one -- that could be the basis for attempted murder. And your don't-leave-town order -- that's still in effect, too.",
        "Paige: You know, I wouldn't blame Todd for wanting to kill Spencer -- after everything he's put him through?",
        "Bo: Hmm. Yeah, I hear you.",
        "Paige: You don't really believe Blair's story, do you?",
        "Bo: Well, she's the only eyewitness, so I have to go with her statement.",
        "Todd: Thanks for letting me off the hook.",
        "Blair: I just told the truth, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Mostly, anyway.",
        "Blair: You didn't intentionally try to hurt me or the baby and you know it.",
        "Todd: Blair, I am so sorry.",
        "Blair: I know. I heard you.",
        "Todd: You heard me from before? You were awake?",
        "Blair: Listening to every word.",
        "Todd: Do we still have a chance?",
        "Nurse: Time to draw blood. You'll have to leave, Mr. Manning.",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ah. Most of the invitees are inside. The guard's bouncing the rest out there.",
        "Nash: Great. Thanks for the hand.",
        "Rex: I'm just backup. You run a good club.",
        "Nash: Thanks. You know what? I think I do got it covered. Why don't you go back to your date and enjoy your night off.",
        "Rex: Say no more.",
        "Nash: All right. Hi.",
        "Claudia: Thanks for taking over for me.",
        "Nash: No problem.",
        "Claudia: Next year, I hope you get everything you want this year. I mean that.",
        "Nash: Thank you.",
        "Claudia: Oh. Oh, hmm. Have a good one.",
        "Jessica: Oh -- where is Claudia going? She's supposed to be helping Antonio.",
        "Nash: She's not feeling well, I'm covering for her. It's all going to be fine. Oh, look at that. I got another fire to put out.",
        "Jessica: Huh.",
        "Rex: So, Cristian gets to take pictures of every woman here who's hanging out in her underwear.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, that's the whole point. What's the matter -- jealous?",
        "Rex: Nope.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Hey, excuse me. Adriana, I was just talking to Layla and she says she's going to hold you to your decision not to allow \"craze's\" photographer to take even one shot of all of this?",
        "Adriana: Mom, I already told you, ok? Look, it's just --",
        "Dorian: Business. I know -- I heard. But, I mean, for you to prevent \"craze\" from covering, you know, a major fashion event like this, just -- well, I couldn't be more proud of you.",
        "Layla: You know, it's all fine and good that Cristian's taking all of these pictures, but all the readers are going to see are the bra straps. I wish we could have afforded more models.",
        "Evangeline: Hmm.",
        "Layla: We need to show a little bit more of our product.",
        "Jessica: Well, let's do it. Hold that for a second.",
        "Layla: Ok.",
        "Jessica: Cristian?",
        "Man: Whoo!",
        "Woman: Whoo!",
        "Layla: Oh, yeah! Yeah! Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Um -- where's John?",
        "Mindy: Sorry. He's not back yet?",
        "Natalie: How long has he been gone? Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You. You're the one who let Truman walk.",
        "John: Why didn't you -- why didn't you tell me who you were?",
        "Marty: I never lied to you. You never gave me a chance to tell you anything about myself.",
        "John: You let me think you were there to help me.",
        "Marty: I was, I am, and you shouldn't be risking your recovery like this.",
