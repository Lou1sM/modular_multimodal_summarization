        "Gigi: I took your advice. I invited Schuyler over. You want details? I'm wearing the sexiest dress I own. I lit about a thousand candles, and I'm so nervous I might throw myself off the mountain before he shows up. Kidding. Good. I'm good. Really.",

        "Matthew: Yeah, with a cane.",
        "Bo: Dan says that that's just until you get your strength back.",

        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha ha. Yeah, Dani could probably use some fun.",

        "Rex: A little?",
        "Stacy: I don't have any stolen stem cells or bags of blood, okay? Scout's honor.",
        "Rex: Then why are you here?",

        "Nora: Yeah, I guess that's kind of obvious, isn't it?",
        "T\u00e9a: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't heard anyone talk about it.",
        "Nora: Oh, good. The last thing that we want is to hurt Clint any more than we already have. We wouldn't even be going to this thing tonight if--",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, please. I can only imagine how Dorian persuaded you to go.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah, she's got ways, doesn't she?",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "Nora: And the good thing is, Clint hates her as much as he hates Bo and me, so...",
        "T\u00e9a: Nora, I'm sure that Clint does not hate you.",
        "Nora: Yeah--yeah, he does. He does. But that's okay. At least we won't have to see him tonight at the ball.",

        "Blair: Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the both of you. I mean, I am. I know what that feels like, and T\u00e9a must be devastated. The boys said that she spent Christmas with the three of you.",

        "Dani: You can't stay here.",
        "Matthew: Why not?",
        "Dani: Because you just got through telling me how much you want to dance. It's real sweet of you, but seriously, I'm okay.",
        "Matthew: All right. You promise to call me if you change your mind?",
        "Dani: I will. Promise.",

        "Schuyler: Mmm! Well, I suppose we need something to go with the panini.",
        "Gigi: Oh. Schuyler, you did not have to do all this.",

        "Blair: Well, I did try everything I possibly could to get you back.",
        "Todd: Well, are you saying that--",
