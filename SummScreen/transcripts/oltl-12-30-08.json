        "Marty \"invites\" Todd to have a romantic encounter with her. He wants more than anything to believe she might still have feelings for him and doesn't heed the likelihood that she may be setting him up. Tea tells him he is asking for trouble meeting her. But Todd does not listen to his lawyer. She admits to Todd that she wishes she could hate him for what he did to her but she admits she is still in love with him. And she obviously has a \"plan for revenge\". Cole knows that his mother has a secret she is not telling anybody. So he leaves the New Years concert where Puddle of Mudd plays. Starr goes with him. Cristian asks Sara to attend the concert with him. But she doesn't want to get him \"in trouble\" with immigration after he's just married Vanessa. So she sits home alone and depressed. John and Blair have a romantic encounter together and he informs her that he is ready to buy Rodi's and own it."

        "Todd: Ah. What, is she going to shoot me?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, Todd. Marty's -- she's not going to shoot you. Wear a wire and get you to incriminate yourself, absolutely.",
        "Todd: She's not going to wear a wire. Don't worry about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh -- why wouldn't she? She wore one before.",

        "T\u00e9a: How?",
        "Todd: Well, you can't incriminate yourself if there's no crime. She said herself I didn't rape her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your daughter is accusing you of kidnapping. Marty's going to be at the top of Nora Hanen's witness list.",
        "Todd: Maybe, maybe not.",

        "T\u00e9a: Where are you meeting? And, yeah, who called who? I bet she told you not to tell anybody, huh?",
        "Todd: You should stop asking so many questions.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, you should listen to me. You should feel damn grateful that I'm here before you land your ass back in jail, Todd.",
        "Todd: Not going to happen. I'm telling you.",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you think is going to happen, Todd? You think she's going to put on some music and pour some wine? You guys going to share your New Year's resolutions, you're going to kiss at midnight? She's using your feelings for her against you. Can't you see that? How can you be so stupid?",
        "Todd: I don't know. All right, well, I'm going. Don't tell anyone. Ah, you can't, can you? Client/lawyer confidentiality.",

        "John: Ever since I left the force.",
        "Blair: That long?",
        "[Romantic music plays]",
        "John: My old man used to hang out at a bar like this in Atlantic City -- the White Oaks Tavern. Everybody knew him, knew what he liked to drink, song he liked on the jukebox. He'd come in after work and the bartender would pour 4 ounces of Irish whiskey and they'd cue up l-17 on the box.",
        "Blair: Yeah. What song was that?",
        "John: \"Crazy.\"",
        "Blair: Oh, that's a great song.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Blair: So did you ever go to White Oaks with him?",
        "John: For research purposes only.",
        "Blair: Oh, what the hell would you be researching at a bar?",
        "John: Bars are a great practice for cops.",
        "Blair: Or bartenders.",
        "John: Hmm -- waiters, short-order cooks, bouncers.",
        "Blair: Oh, my gosh, that's so many jobs. Now, are you going to have time for the other things in your life that are important?",
        "John: If you don't mind hanging out here once in a while.",

        "Starr: Then why aren't you out there dancing with Markko?",
        "Langston: Oh, I can't celebrate with you?",
        "Starr: Okay. There is nothing in that adoption agreement that says that a cousin has to hang out with her other cousin that's a complete drag.",
        "Langston: Well, I want to, okay, and you're not a drag. You're sad and you're -- nobody who's sad should be hanging out alone on New Year's Eve.",

It was too much to bear. I wanted to hurt you. I had to hurt you. I had to make you pay for what you'd done to me.",
        "Todd: Well, I can certainly understand that. I mean, to tell you the truth, I thought you were going to get on the stand and lie. I thought you were going to say I did worse things than I did. Certainly, everyone would've believed you.",
        "Marty: I should've. I should've but I couldn't. As much as that's what I wanted to do, I couldn't do it. When they dropped the charges, I was relieved. Because as much as I hate you, I love you more.",
