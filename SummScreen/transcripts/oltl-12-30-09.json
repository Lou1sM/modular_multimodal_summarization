Dorian calls Mitch Laurence and tells him she kept her end of the bargain and now he must honor his end and stay away from her girls. Danielle goes to La Boulaie and pulls a gun on Todd but Blair talks her down. Todd calls Tea so she leaves the ball to go get Dani. Tea promises Dani that she will not see Todd anymore and takes her back to her room at the Palace. Todd gives the gun to Eli who returns it to Bo's safe where Dani got it.",
        "At the New Year's Eve party at Ultraviolet, Destiny declares her love for Matthew, but Matthew tells her he doesn't feel the same way about her; she is his best friend. She suggests that he strung her along the way Rachel did with Shaun and now he is trading up to someone prettier and skinnier. She tells him to go be with Dani, but he says he doesn't feel that way about Dani either. Ford arrives at Ultraviolet and tells Markko and Langston that he will be the teaching assistant in the class he is taking at LU.",

        "Dani: Sure I do. I'm going to kill you, just like you killed my father.",
        "Todd: All right, just listen to me--",
        "Dani: Just shut up! I don't want to hear anything you have to say, you bastard.",
        "Todd: I know that you're scared.",
        "Dani: Don't come near me.",
        "Todd: How'd you get that gun, anyway?",
        "Dani: It was easy. It'll be even easier to pull the trigger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: So, since Danielle's out having fun with Matthew tonight, why don't you at least try to have a little fun yourself?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh ho ho ho. You're sweet to try to cheer me up, but fun? My guess is the mayor's ball's gonna be about as fun as watching paint dry. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm serious. Bo, you're fired.",
        "Nora: Dorian, you can't do that.",
        "Dorian: Oh, but I have to. Commissioner Buchanan, I insist you hand over your badge right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I mean it, Matthew, I love you. I'm, like, really into you.",
        "Matthew: But, I mean, I thought we were friends.",
        "Destiny: We are. And I just figured after everything we've been through, we could kind of, you know, level up, be more like boyfriend and girlfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Where's your girl?",
        "Markko: Uh, checking in with Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Ford, I thought you went back to L.A.",
        "Ford: I did, but now I'm back in P.A.",
        "Langston: I can't believe it. Your ears must have been burning. I was just talking about you.",
        "Ford: Missed me that bad, huh?",
        "Langston: Full of yourself much?",
        "Ford: No, no, just hopeful. To be honest, I've been thinking a lot about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Oliver, how long have you been here?",
        "Oliver: Um, I just got here.",
        "Stacy: Oh, so you didn't hear...",
        "Oliver: Hear what?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I was sort of singing the words to the last song, and I can't carry a tune to save my life.",
        "Oliver: Okay. Not worry, I didn't hear a thing.",
        "Stacy: Whew. Boy, that was close. If Fish found out you were his baby instead of Rex's, we'd both be sunk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Officer Fish, glad you called ahead. I set those seats up for you and your guy tonight.",
        "Oliver: You know what, give them to someone else. Kyle made other plans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: What are you doing?",
        "Nick: What does it look like I'm doing?",
        "Kyle: Dude, Nick! I'm with Oliver now.",
        "Nick: And Oliver's not here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: The hospital dragged him in last minute?",
        "Oliver: Ha! No. No, Kyle could have been here with me tonight, but he chose to be with someone else.",
        "Rex: Buddy, I know how you feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You want me to stay the night?",
        "Gigi: I'm pretty sure that's what I said.",
        "Schuyler: Are you asking me because you know I have no place else to stay or...or...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Look, I know that you hate me, but you really don't want to do this.",
        "Dani: Don't tell me what I want.",
        "Blair: No, Dani, don't.",
        "Dani: He killed my father. Why should he get to live?",
        "Blair: Because, sweetie, your father isn't dead.",
        "Dani: I saw him shoot my father! Saw my dad fall off the bridge into the water with a bullet in his chest, so how could he possibly be alive?",
        "Todd: Blair... just because they didn't find a body, doesn't mean he survived. Please don't fill the child's head with hope.",
        "Dani: You took any hope I ever had when you murdered my dad!",
        "Todd: Danielle, I don't blame you for wanting me dead. Somebody took away someone I loved, I'd feel the same way you do. I would never forgive them.",
        "Dani: What's this? Reverse psychology?",
        "Todd: I have done this. I've tried to get back at people who have hurt me. But believe me, the only one you end up hurting is yourself.",
        "Dani: Don't move!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: What was that you were saying about this party being dull?",
        "Dorian: Bo, I still don't have that badge.",
        "Nora: Oh, this is ridiculous, Dorian. He's not going to hand over his badge. Don't hand over your badge.",
        "Dorian: Fine, he can hand it over tomorrow morning to Internal Affairs. Let this serve notice to all of those working under me-- I intend to run a squeaky clean administration. And if the police commissioner shows such appalling personal judgment that he has an affair with the district attorney, who happens to be married to his brother, then how can he be trusted with official police business?",
        "Bo: This is not the time or place.",
        "Reporter: Commissioner Buchanan, are these allegations true?",
        "Second Reporter: Are you having an affair with your brother's wife?",
        "Bo: I said no comment.",
        "Reporter: Mr. Buchanan, do you think your brother should be fired because of his affair with your wife?",
        "Clint: Well, all I can say is, actions have consequences.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Langston, is everything okay over here?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I'm fine. Ford's just a friend.",
        "Shaun: A friend who knows and respects the fact that she has a boyfriend.",
        "Langston: I'm fine, really, it's all good. We're just catching up. [Chuckles] Dorian just got elected mayor, and she's a little paranoid about the family's safety. She thinks we don't know.",
        "Ford: That's a drag, huh?",
        "Langston: Hmm, sort of. So what brings you back to Llanview?",
        "Markko: Yeah, I'd like to know that myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I don't know what to say.",
        "Destiny: Neither did I. That's why I kept my mouth shut this whole time.",
        "Matthew: Really?",
        "Destiny: I wanted to tell you, but something always got in the way. This is the first time and it's probably not the right time. But I mean, you're here, you're walking. We danced. And I just didn't want to start the new year without telling you how I felt about you, without knowing how you felt about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: We had something really good together, Kyle. We clicked.",
        "Kyle: We've been over this, Nick. Okay? I'm in a relationship with Oliver. I love him.",
        "Nick: You love him? Well, I'm saying that you can have me. Oliver doesn't have to know.",
        "Kyle: Was he right about you all along? Were you lying to me so you could stay here?",
        "Nick: No, no, look. Oliver's just jealous. I needed help, you stepped up, and he just can't handle it.",
        "Kyle: So you didn't know anything about another room being available here?",
        "Nick: Of course not!",
        "Kyle: Do you swear, Nick?",
        "Nick: I could never do something like that!",
        "Kyle: Use what happened to you to get back with me? No, you couldn't.",
        "Nick: Let's just forget this thing ever happened, okay? Just, things have gotten so stirred up for me. You've been so good to me ever since I was bashed, and... you were there for me when I needed somebody. And if you want me to move to that guy Joplin's old room, I'm more--",
        "Kyle: No. You mean Schuyler's room?",
        "Nick: Yes. The room that Roxy just--",
        "Kyle: Roxy never told us whose room it was.",
        "Nick: Sure she did.",
        "Kyle: No, she didn't, Nick! You were the one she talked to when she called here, right? She thinks she talked to me because you lied.",
        "Nick: No, no, Kyle--",
        "Kyle: What else have you been lying to me about, Nick? That you had nowhere else to go, that you couldn't stay with Amelia?",
        "Nick: No, that's true!",
        "Kyle: Okay.",
        "Nick: What are you doing? Kyle, what are you doing?",
        "Kyle: Amelia?",
        "Nick: Kyle, please. Please. Please.",
        "Kyle: Oliver was right about you all along.",
        "[Nick crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Tonight any guys who are not with the person they are supposed to be with drink on the house.",
        "Oliver: Thank you, but I should probably take it easy. The last time I felt like crap and tied one on, I ended up doing something really stupid.",
        "Stacy: Tonight, we're going to do what a man and woman are supposed to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: [Gasps] Are you kidding me?",
        "Shaun: Not again! I was just standing here.",
        "Stacy: You are so lucky that's just club soda.",
        "Shaun: How far along are you?",
        "Stacy: That's none of your business!",
        "Shaun: I'm all for the miracle of life. But you bringing those hormones into a bar and you start acting up? You are fixin' to get slapped! I would hate to see you get into a catfight in your condition.",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, I'm really worried. My baby's father is right over there.",

        "Schuyler: I need you to be sure about this.",
        "Gigi: Why? You're not?",
        "Schuyler: No, I am. I've waited for this for so long. But the stakes are higher for you, Gigi, and if you're not ready--",
        "Gigi: Shut up. Shut up and make love to me.",
        "Schuyler: You're nervous.",
        "Gigi: No, I'm not. Okay, yes. But not because I don't want... it's just, I've never been with another--",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, it's you and me tonight. Here alone. Whatever that means for you, it means, whatever it doesn't... doesn't matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I trusted you! I defended you! I let you into my home!",
        "Nick: Because I freaked out! Because one minute, I had this terrific guy. And the next minute I'm alone in the back alley of some bar, getting beaten by thugs for being gay. And I was so scared, Kyle. I was lying there, thinking I don't want to die alone. And then you showed up to the hospital, and you were so great. And all of a sudden, I don't want to die alone turned into I don't want to live alone. I don't want to go asleep alone. I don't want to wake up alone. I don't want to do all the things that... I convinced myself that I couldn't be alone. And you were there, this guy that I love and I trust. It was like I didn't have to be alone. And I--I just didn't count on how much you love Oliver. I'm so sorry, Kyle.",
        "Kyle: I'm sorry, too. I should have made it more clear.",
        "Nick: No, no, you were great.",
        "Kyle: But not to Oliver.",
        "Nick: Yeah. Go. I'll be gone when you get back.",
        "Kyle: Nick, are you sure about that?",
        "Nick: I'll be fine. I'll either take the room down the hall or I'll call Amelia. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Hey, man, I'm going to take off.",
        "Rex: Come on, who's throwing a better party than mine, huh?",
        "Oliver: No one, but I'm not really in the party mood. And, you know, staying here watching all these happy people celebrate is only going to make me feel worse.",

        "Woman: It seems so crazy, this life unwinding, and quiet moments, they seem rare, but when you call my name...",
        "Ford: Hey, man, great to see you. You still trying to break into the biz?",
        "Markko: I'm in the film department at L.U. Just turned in my editing project.",
        "Ford: Yeah? How'd it go?",
        "Markko: Professor was all over it.",
        "Langston: Yeah, it's killer.",
        "Markko: I got picked to be in a special seminar next term. Only eight people got in.",
        "Ford: Yeah? What's the topic?",
        "Markko: Pre to post production for an indie market.",
        "Ford: Great. I guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other, then.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Do you even know how to use that thing?",
        "Dani: How hard could it be? A moron like you figured it out. Didn't have trouble shooting my dad!",
        "Blair: Dani...he was just trying to save your life.",
        "Dani: My father and I could have made it!",
        "Blair: You know that that's not true. You were scared to death. That water was freezing. And if Ross had made you jump, you would have died. And if you pull that trigger right now, sweetie, you'll be throwing your life away. Listen to me. I know what it's like to feel alone. I grew up without a mother and a father, and I had feelings that I thought nobody understood and that wouldn't go away. But I'm promising you right now... your life's going to get better, it is.",
        "Dani: How can you promise me anything? You don't know anything about me!",
        "Todd: Just give me the gun.",
        "Blair: Come on, Dani.",
        "Todd: It's okay.",
        "Blair: You're not a killer. You're just really, really sad.",

        "Dorian: I have just made the very difficult decision to replace Commissioner Buchanan, so I have not come up with a successor yet, but I can assure you that the vetting process will be thorough, and that's all I have to say on the matter.

        "Destiny: You want everything! Just like your sister. You strung me along the same way Rachel did with Shaun, until someone prettier and skinnier came along.",

        "Dorian: Nora, dear, that high horse you're trying to mount just bucked you off.",
        "Nora: No. If you want to hurt me, then fine, go ahead and do it, but don't do this to Bo. Or are you just so hell-bent on revenge, you don't care who you hurt?",
        "Dorian: [Laughs] How can you talk about me hurting Bo? I mean, you cheated on the man when you were married to him. And you stole Clint away from me and then you cheated on him once you were married to him! For goodness sake, your behavior compared to Bo's makes his behavior look angelic. At least he was single. You are very, very lucky that you're an elected official, or else I would have fired you, too. And if you had any decency at all, you'd resign.",

        "Kyle: Yeah, yeah, those are all from me. You don't have bother checking. They pretty much say the same thing. [Sighs] I'm sorry. Okay, you were right. Nick was using what happened to him to try to get back with me.",
        "Oliver: He admitted it?",
        "Kyle: Not so much. I kind of figured it out. But I was really naive and I was a complete jerk. Okay, I should trust by now that you would never lie to me, and...[Sighs] Will you forgive me?",

But, you know, everything's always been about me and to hell with everybody else. But now I've got somebody more important. Somebody to depend on me for everything. Somebody expecting me to do the right thing. So that's what I'm going to do.",
