        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Can you say something? Cat got your tongue? Roxy the cat. I was going to say this to you the other day, but I figured kisses speak louder than words, maybe for both of us.",
        "Miles: Uh --",
        "Roxy: \"Uh\" what? You feel the same way about me, don't you?",

        "Nora: Oh, my God.",
        "Clint: They're pretty memorable.",
        "Nora: What are you doing here? I thought everyone was gone. It's New Year's Eve, for goodness sake. Why aren't you out?",
        "Clint: I didn't feel like getting dressed up and going out with a bunch of amateur drinkers who are going to blow noisemakers in my ears.",
        "Nora: Oh. Well, I -- I -- I age with you and I figured that since I was going to be a stick in the mud, I might as well go all out.",
        "Clint: Sorry if I'm making you feel uncomfortable.",
        "Nora: Well -- no, I mean, we knew, I mean, no matter how big this house is, there was a chance that we were going to see each other in a new way, and it just -- I mean, not in a new way. I mean, just that we were going to, you know, probably run into each other and do -- just not that --",

        "Clint: Now, you look --",
        "Nora: Don't you dare say \"fine.\" That's a four-letter f-word.",
        "Clint: I was going to say you don't look like a woman who needs a mud mask.",
        "Nora: Thank you. Oh -- oh! I'm cracking. I can't smile. I'm actually trying to open my pores. I thought maybe getting some more oxygen to my brain would be stimulating, yeah.",
        "Clint: How about a little stimulating conversation?",
        "Nora: With you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Uh, you're a crazy person. Um -- \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"? Your Grandma Addie.",

        "Markko: Oh, I'm sorry.",

        "Starr: Yes! Of course! I thought you were going to get it.",
        "Markko: How did you get that?",
        "Langston: Um, excuse me, I know my best friend, or what?",
        "Starr and Langston: What.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: What's wrong? You thinking about your sister?",
        "Layla: Last year Vange was making some stupid resolution about eating more fiber or something and, I don't know --",
        "Vincent: Hey, maybe she's making a New Year's resolution this year, too -- to get well -- and you just don't know about it yet.",
        "Layla: I was just so hoping that hearing Cristian's voice --",
        "Vincent: Voice would make a difference, I know. Look, don't stop hoping, okay?",
        "Layla: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Kellen, would you give me a minute to talk to Cris?",
        "Kellen: Fine. The band's out of here in an hour.",
        "Cristian: You're going on the road with his band? What the hell?",
        "Sarah: Don't worry. I've got acts booked for the club up through the end of January.",
        "Cristian: Oh, right, like that's what I'm worried about. And you met this guy when?",
        "Sarah: Tonight, but I know his music, and his band --",
        "Cristian: Whatever. Just let me tell you about my visit with Evangeline.",
        "Sarah: Cristian, I can't do this again. I can't talk to you about your girlfriend who's in a coma, not tonight.",
        "Cristian: This isn't about her, it's about me. You know, seeing her tonight made me realize that I'm finally ready to -- to let go of 2007 and put all that stuff that happened last year where it belongs.",
        "Sarah: Where does it belong?",
        "Cristian: You know, I just spent three hours in crazy traffic because there was only one place that I wanted to be. I want to start the year off right -- with you.",
        "Adriana: I always thought an October wedding would be nice, but tulips are my favorite and they're out of season, and I always thought soft colors would be nice for bridesmaids, but spring is so close. A winter wedding would be cool, but I don't want to freeze if I wear a strapless dress. And then I have to find a way not to invite Blair, and then there's Addie and -- what's wrong?",
        "Rex: It's, you know, a lot to think about.",
        "Adriana: Sorry. I'm a girl. I've been thinking about my wedding, like, since forever.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know and if you want a big, fancy wedding, isn't, like, a year the minimum you need to plan it?",
        "Adriana: Not when your mom is Dorian Lord.",
        "Rex: Or Roxy Balsom. Keg, hall, we're set.",
        "[Adriana chuckles]",
        "Rex: I spent all the money I had saved on a ring that you had to give back. I'm not exactly feeling like the catch of the century right now.",
        "Adriana: It's no big deal.",
        "Rex: It is to me. I want to be able to afford the wedding of your dreams.",
        "Adriana: Rex, the bride's family pays for the wedding. It's tradition.",
        "Rex: Oh, since when are we traditional about anything?",
        "Adriana: So, you want to wait to get married? Till when?",
        "Rex: Well, it's not just a wedding we need to pay for. It's kids.",
        "Adriana: Kids?",
        "Rex: Well, someday.",
        "Adriana: So let's hope that I sell a lot of lingerie.",
        "Rex: Wow, I need to figure out what to do about U.V., step up the P.I. biz --",
        "Adriana: Uh, what, and be out on the road all the time, leaving me with the babies?",
        "Rex: I need a better track record. If I'd just stayed in Texas, found Marcie and Tommy, everyone in the country would know who I am.",
        "Adriana: But instead, you bought a ring and came back here to propose to me.",
        "Rex: No, that's not what I meant. I'm just saying I can't believe that I was so close --",
        "Adriana: You want to go back?",
        "Rex: I owe it to Michael. I just can't believe Gigi the waitress lied to me and I bought it.",
        "Adriana: Some waitress in a diner that you've never met before -- you're supposed to know that she's setting you up?",
        "Rex: She wasn't just some diner waitress.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: We went to high school together.",
        "Adriana: In Michigan?",
        "Rex: Kind of wild, huh?",
        "Adriana: And she moved to Paris, Texas, made friends with Marcie, and sold you her engagement ring. That, yes, is a huge coincidence.",
        "Rex: No kidding.",
        "Adriana: Why didn't you tell me about this before? How well did you know each other?",
        "Rex: Uh -- we dated and stuff.",
        "Adriana: \"And stuff\"?",
        "Rex: We were teenagers.",
        "Adriana: And you just forgot to mention old Gigi and now you want to go back to Texas and see her?",
        "Rex: To find out why she lied to me and what she knows about Marcie, that's all.",
        "Adriana: Rex --",
        "Rex: I love you -- what?",
        "Adriana: If I did have a ring right now, I would give it back to you. The engagement's off.",
        "Rex: You're breaking up with me -- because I didn't tell you about some girl I saw that I dated, like, a million years ago?",
        "Adriana: I am not breaking up with you.",
        "Rex: But you don't want to marry me?",
        "Adriana: I'm dying to marry you. But maybe we're not ready. I mean, you want to put off the wedding as long as possible --",
        "Rex: No, no, I didn't say that.",
        "Adriana: You felt so pressured to propose to me that you bought an engagement ring from your ex-girlfriend no questions asked and you couldn't even make yourself tell me the truth about it.",
        "Rex: You know the truth now.",
        "Adriana: What else don't I know? I mean, here we are planning our future together, and I'm thinking, \"How much don't I know about your past\"?",
        "Rex: It's called a past for a reason. I don't care about all the guys you dated in high school.",
        "Adriana: It was a convent school.",
        "Rex: Or all the boyfriends you had.",
        "Adriana: Two, River and Duke. I've never kept a single thing from you.",
        "Rex: Look, I've never kept anything from you, either. I didn't know that you needed to know every detail about every girl I've ever dated, because I love you and only you.",
        "Adriana: You know how they say when you sleep with someone you're sleeping with every other person they've ever slept with?",
        "Rex: That's if you don't use protection.",
        "Adriana: Work with me here. Who else was there? How many, exactly?",
        "Rex: I don't know.",
        "Adriana: You don't know? Okay. How many of them did you say \"I love you\" to? How many did you plan a future with? I mean, you've already been married. I'm going to be your second wife. And if it didn't work out then, what the hell makes you think that it's going to work out with us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, I've only been involved with, like, scammers and schemers and guys who only wanted one thing out of mend once they got it, they went bye- bye. You know, taillights. And I want you to know that you're the first good guy I've ever fallen for.",
        "Miles: A good guy? I -- I think maybe you and Natalie are the only people that think I'm a good guy.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, maybe you're the only person who thinks I am, too -- if you do.",
        "Miles: Of course I do.",
        "Roxy: And -- and I got to tell you this, also. That community service -- it changed me. I mean, I enjoyed every minute of it -- except for those kids, because they can really suck the life out of you. But what I want you to know is, it was like you were breathing life into me. And I just wanted to tell you that. It's not something that all of a sudden, I'm thinking about it. It's something that's been building and building up inside of me. And the other day when you got hurt and I thought you were lost --",
        "Miles: Rox, I -- I don't know what to say.",
        "Roxy: Well, you don't have to say the l word. You can just say \"ditto,\" or you can just kiss me real hard.",
        "Miles: You know, Rox -- I mean, you're -- you're like a breath of fresh air in my life.",
        "Roxy: Now, you're not going to let me down real easy, are you, Miles?",
        "Miles: Rox, I care about you, a lot -- as a friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You know, I just did this -- this whole year in review, and let me tell you something about 2008. There's no where to go but up.",
        "Nora: Ah.",
        "Clint: The thing that I dreaded the most happening -- my father dying -- happened. And I'm getting through it. And a long-lost son has seemingly been found, and I am getting through that, and whatever the hell it is I had with Dorian is over, thank God.",
        "Nora: Well, I'm glad that you're not too heartbroken over it. I -- I really -- I've kind of been giving myself a lot of grief for my participation in its demise.",
        "Clint: No, no, no. No, it's not even remotely your fault.",
        "Nora: Oh, I kind of let you know exactly what I was thinking about her.",
        "Clint: You did, but it opened my eyes a little bit.",
        "Nora: And I kissed you.",
        "Clint: I kissed you, too. Twice.",
        "Nora: Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You know what? While we're closing the books on 2007, here's to platonic kisses between roommates -- so last year. Wouldn't you agree? Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Talia, wait.",
        "Talia: I've been waiting. I have, and now that I'm leaving town, now you decide to come and kiss me?",
        "Antonio: It's New Year's Eve.",
        "Talia: And -- wait, that makes it okay?",
        "Antonio: Would you just let me talk?",
        "Talia: You know what? I know what this is about. It's safe for you to kiss me now because I'm going to be gone tomorrow and you'll never have to see me again.",
        "Antonio: No, no, you know that's not what I want.",
        "Talia: You know what? I'm going to get over you. I'm going to find a guy who wants what I want, and that's a future.",
        "Antonio: What if we have a future? Would you still leave Llanview?",

        "Langston: Really? No.",
        "Markko: Yeah. My mom wants me to head out of here before there's any traffic. She's afraid I'll ding the family wagon or something.",
        "Langston: Well, can't you just spend the night?",
        "Markko: Oh, yeah, that'll happen.",
        "[Langston giggles]",
        "Markko: No. I was supposed to be home, like, at the stroke of midnight, so I'd better head out. Otherwise, I don't get the car keys.",
        "Langston: Oh, and I only love you because you take me out in \"the wagon.\"",

        "Cole: Sorry I'm such a downer.",
        "Langston: If you were acting like everything was fine, I'd be really worried.",
        "Cole: I shouldn't have come here tonight. I just didn't want to hurt Starr's feelings.",
        "Langston: Well, you need to take care of yourself right now.",
        "Cole: Starr says that she'll do anything for me, but how am I supposed to tell the girl that I love to leave me alone?",

        "Talia: How would you even know that?",
        "Antonio: Let me finish. The reason you didn't put your heart on the line -- I didn't, either. That's why I didn't say anything. Not because I wanted to make a fool of you, and certainly not because I needed my ego stroked. I mean, I -- I -- I enjoyed having you pay attention to me, but it was only because it was you, Talia, and I wanted you.",
        "Talia: But you said that you didn't.",
        "Antonio: Yeah -- no, what I said was, is I didn't want to start something that I couldn't -- if I couldn't follow through, especially with you. I know -- I know I hurt you.",
        "Talia: Ahem.",
        "Antonio: Okay? But I -- I was honestly trying not to. I cannot let you get on that bus without letting you know how I feel. It was not one-sided, all right? And I know we don't have the time to tell you all the different reasons why I care don't I just hit the highlights, okay?",
        "Talia: Okay.",
        "Antonio: You're -- you're smart, you're funny. My -- my daughter is a terrific judge of character, and -- and she's crazy about you. You're gorgeous. You're a great cop. You -- you've always got my back. Look, New Year's -- New Year's is a time for new beginnings, and all I'm asking is for a second chance, and if I've blown it, then I completely understand. But I couldn't let you go without letting you know how much you mean to me.",

        "Adriana: Are you sure?",
        "Rex: I am so sure.",
        "Adriana: Look, I know that you had a life before you met me, but I guess I just need to know -- I'm going to be your wife. I need to know how many more Gigis or Mimis or Fifis are going to be popping up from out of nowhere.",

        "Cristian: But I need to put the past behind me. I need to live in the present, and you're the present. Unless you leave, if that's still what you want to do.",
        "Sarah: Everything you just said is what I've been wanting to hear all along. But you couldn't say it before. What changed?",

        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Well, um, legally speaking, I think that, you know, it comes down to an issue -- is it quality or quantity?",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Nora: Well -- oh, I -- I'm not saying that the quality was bad. The quality was wonderful, your kisses were really -- um, wonderful. Uh -- how -- how many kisses? Um -- more than two? Three. Three.",

        "Layla: Your art gallery? Vincent, the deal went through?",
        "Vincent: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, Lindsay still has to cross a couple of T's for me, but the next time your mother says \"Vincent, what are you working on now?\"",
