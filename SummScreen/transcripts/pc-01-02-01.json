        "Eve: I'm scared to death. ",
        "Ian: I told you I'd go with you. All you have to do is ask. ",
        "Eve: I know, but this is -- this is something I have to do alone. Once I tell \r\nKevin that I'm in love with you, the fact that I'm alive might not be such good \r\nnews. ",
        "Ian: I'm not moving from this place till you get back. I promise you. ",

        "Kevin: Yeah. Well, I guess they'll just have to cart me off to the slammer, \r\nthen. You said something the other night that suddenly I realized what you \r\nmeant. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I say way too many things. What did I say? ",
        "Kevin: \"Welcome home.\" I realized you weren't talking about this place or \r\nany place. You were -- you were talking about right here. You and me. You're my \r\nhome, Lucy. ",

        "Kevin: Well, it wouldn't be the first time I feel like I'm living in the Indy \r\n500. I better make sure everything's ok. ",

        "Chris: No, and you don't. You don't. I'll do better. Anyway, it's late. I \r\nshould go. ",

        "Jack: No. No, that's all right. I've already left a couple. Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: You know, a girl finds out a guy has a little bit of a record, \r\nit'd probably wig her out a little bit. ",
        "Jack: Livvie's been through her own stuff. She doesn't judge people. We've \r\ngot something, man, because I can't stop thinking about her. Which wasn't my \r\nplan from the beginning. ",
        "Jamal: So what was your plan, then? ",
        "Jack: Well, that's another story, but the ending's changed now. But the point \r\nis now that I've found her, I'm not letting her go. ",

        "Ian: Short version. We were kidnapped by a man named Harris, an enemy from my \r\npast. ",
        "Kevin: Harris. He's the one that Victor suspected of setting the car bomb.\r\n",
        "Ian: Well, Victor's a smart man, but obviously we got out of the car before \r\nit blew up. ",
        "Kevin: But what did he want with you? And what did he want with Eve? ",
        "Ian: He was dying and he had the brilliant idea that we were the ones to save \r\nhim. ",
        "Kevin: And you couldn't let any of us know that you were still alive? ",
        "Ian: I just got through telling you. We were cut off from the outside world. \r\nWe were kidnapped. As soon as we managed to escape, we came to the lighthouse. \r\nThat's why we were there tonight. Eve was going to tell you -- ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God. That was her knocking on the door. Ian, how could you let \r\nthis happen? ",
        "Ian: You think I wanted this? ",
        "Kevin: Eve -- Harris was your problem, not Eve's! But she got caught in the \r\nmiddle, again. ",
        "Ian: I swear, if I could have prevented this -- ",
        "Kevin: You son of a bitch! I don't want excuses! My wife was taken from me! I \r\nthought she was dead, and now she might really die, thanks to you!",
        "Joe: Hey, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin! Take it easy. ",
        "Kevin: It's because of him! He's the reason all this happened! ",
        "Joe: I'm sure that's not true. ",
        "Ian: It is true. Never should have happened. ",
        "Joe: Both of you, just calm down, all right? We're doing everything we can.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Calm down? How do you expect me to calm down when my wife could be in \r\nthere dying? ",
        "Ian: What do you know, Joseph? ",

        "Joe: Hey, Eve's a fighter, Ian. You know that, all right? She's going to pull \r\nthrough. ",
        "Ian: Don't whitewash this for me! I saw her get hit by the car and I know she \r\ncould die, and if she does, I'm the one that killed her. ",

        "Karen: Well -- ",
        "Ian: Karen -- Karen, what's going on? ",
        "Karen: She's stabilized. There were no other internal injuries, but she has \r\nsuffered a pretty significant head trauma. ",
        "Ian: How significant? ",
        "Karen: We don't know that yet. Look, you guys are doctors. You obviously know \r\nthe longer she's unconscious -- ",
