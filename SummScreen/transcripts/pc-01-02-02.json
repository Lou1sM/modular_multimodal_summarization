        "Rafe: Yeah, pretty bright, huh? ",
        "Alison: Rafe? Oh, my God, you're back! But how? ",
        "Rafe: Long story. ",
        "Alison: What, did you -- did you cause that light? ",
        "Rafe: No, I've never seen anything like it. ",
        "Alison: I'm so glad you're back. ",
        "Rafe: You ok? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, but did you just see what I saw? ",
        "Rafe: All I see right now are spots. ",
        "Alison: Well, what do you think it was? ",
        "Rafe: I don't -- what does it mean, huh? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I cannot believe that she went to sleep. She's out like a light with \r\nall this incredible excitement. ",
        "Kevin: Well, she had a big night. ",
        "Lucy: Ooh. So did we. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. You know what? ",
        "Lucy: Hmm? ",
        "Kevin: That light was pretty weird, wasn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it was really strange. At first I was kind of scared by it, but \r\nthen -- ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. The more I looked at it, the more beautiful it became. \r\nAnd then it made me feel kind of good, all -- all warm inside. ",
        "Kevin: Really? ",
        "Lucy: Hey, but we still don't know where it came from, though. ",
        "Kevin: You know, I think I know someone who might. ",
        "Lucy: Who? ",
        "Kevin: Hold the thought. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I'll be right here. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Victor: Are you all right? Did you see it? Is Lucy all right? What about \r\nChristina? No, I'm fine, too. I'm at the hospital now. I was at the restaurant \r\nwhen it happened. I came over here right away to see if I could lend a hand, but \r\nso far nobody's come in hurt. ",
        "Eve: Colleen, hey. ",
        "Ian: Anyone hurt? ",
        "Colleen: No, we're all clear so far. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Good. ",
        "Eve: Hey. ",

        "Eve: You saw it, too? ",
        "Ian: Any theories? ",
        "Victor: Celestial leftovers burning up as they came through the outer \r\natmosphere. I mean, what else could it be? ",
        "Ian: Right, right, so everything's normal. See, nothing to worry about as \r\nlong as no one's hurt. ",

        "Karen: Hey, are you all right? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, just a little shook up. Oh, not much of a shoulder. ",

        "Alison: I thought that I would never see you again. ",

        "Alison: What, so does that mean that you're here to stay? ",
        "Rafe: For a little while. But, you know, no tricks this time, no magic, no \r\nspecial anything. I'm just -- I'm just me. ",
        "Alison: You're not \"just,\" Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Anyway, tell me what happened to you. ",
        "Alison: I -- I slipped and fell on the ice when I was on my way to see Jamal.\r\n",
        "Rafe: And he didn't fly right home? ",
        "Alison: No. You know, he's still worried about hope and stuff and trying to \r\ntake care of Gabby and Valerie. I really didn't want to worry him. ",
        "Rafe: Don't you think he'd like to know that -- ",
        "Alison: What I think is I don't want to think about anything else except \r\ncelebrating you being back. So let's get started. ",
        "Rafe: On what? ",
        "Alison: On whatever you missed out on the first time around. See, Rafe, in \r\nthis lifetime, you're going to do some living. ",

        "Kevin: Are those magic fingers or what? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy, those are magic fingers. Is there anything else magical about \r\nyou? ",
        "Kevin: Magic? ",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm. I'd say miraculous. Oh, Doc, we had so many miracles happen to \r\nus over the holidays. Look at this. We're married. And you, sir -- you brought \r\nmy little girl back to me. I love you for that, too. Oh, boy. You know what? I \r\nthink that bright light we saw -- I think it was just all the happiness shining \r\nout of my heart right back at you. ",
        "Kevin: I love you, too, Mrs. Collins. ",
        "Lucy: Hmm. Oh, now, wait a minute. I have to instruct you properly in this. \r\nThis is Mrs. Doctor Kevin Lucy Coe Collins. ",

        "Eve: Victor still at it? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. He's already talked to the Air Force and the National Weather \r\nsomething and some writer at \"Star Trek.\" Still nothing on the light. ",

        "Eve: Ok -- ",
        "Girl: Ow! ",
        "Ian: What happened? ",
        "Frank: We're still not sure. ",
        "Karen: This light forced us off the road. ",
        "Frank: And when we got out of the truck, we found these two. ",
        "Woman: I just stepped off the bus walking to my hotel, when out of nowhere \r\nthis lunatic child on a motorcycle ran me down. ",
        "Girl: Talk to the hand, lady, all right? Talk to the hand. My poor bike's in \r\nworse shape than your butt-ugly knees. ",
        "Woman: You have a mouth on you. ",
        "Girl: You know, where is my bike anyway? I'm just on my way back to N.Y.C., ready to party when that freaking light zaps and \r\nMiss Ugly Knees jumps right out \r\n-- ",
        "Woman: Listen, you better -- ",
        "Eve: Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's enough! Stop it! ",
        "Ian: Let's break up these two. Come on, come on. ",
        "Girl: Yo, and don't even think I'm not going to sue, you moo. Ow! God. \r\nWhere's my bike? ",
        "Frank: It's in the back of my truck and it's not going anywhere, all right?\r\n",
        "Karen: Oh, wow, just like you. So why don't you sit still and let me look at \r\nyour arm? ",
        "Girl: Here, see it? Aah! ",
        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Woman: First night in town, I end up on a gurney. ",
        "Ian: Well, just look at the service you're getting. ",
        "Woman: It's nice when a husband-and-wife team work so well together. ",
        "Eve: How'd you know we were husband and wife? ",
        "Ian: Come on. She saw love in our eyes. No surprise there. ",
        "Victor: It was a blinding flash of light which apparently was seen only here \r\nin Port Charles. ",
        "Karen: Ok, I need to take some x-rays, make sure there's no fracture, so \r\nyou're going to need to take off all your rings and things. ",
        "Frank: Here, let me help -- ",
        "Girl: No way, this puppy stays right here. I never take it off and I never \r\nwill. ",

        "Livvie: Yeah, did you guys see that bright light? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. Close enough to run us off the road. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, that's how we met Casey here. Casey, Livvie Locke, Jack Ramsey.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh. Hi, Casey. ",
        "Casey: Hiya, Jack Ramsey. ",
        "Frank: Hey, Jack, here, can help you fix up your bike. He owns a shop. ",
        "Casey: Oh, I was looking to leave Hicksville ASAP, but -- ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, so, what did you do to your bike, huh? ",
        "Casey: Check this out. I'm just tooling along, right, and, bam, this \r\nhumongous light comes out of nowhere -- ",
        "victor: Excuse me, excuse me. Wait a minute, you were that close? What did \r\nyou see? ",
        "Casey: Not all that much. At least, not once brainiac over there got in my \r\nway. ",
        "Woman: If you hadn't been driving that death machine at a ridiculous speed --\r\n",
        "Casey: You know, I'm a zillion miles under the speed limit when suddenly \r\nbutton-down doofus right over there -- she just walks out into the road without \r\nlooking. What, are you blind, lady? ",
        "Woman: That's right. ",

        "Lucy: I have been saving this for a very, very special occasion, and if \r\ntonight's not a special occasion I don't know what is. So close your eyes, close \r\nyour eyes. I thought maybe I'd just run upstairs -- open your eyes. Open -- and \r\nput this on. What do you think? ",

        "Lucy: Uh-huh. ",

        "Alison: Where do we start? I mean, you've got to have some sort of an idea, \r\nright? There's got to be things that you look back on and wish that you would've \r\ndone, right? ",
        "Rafe: Well -- ",
        "Alison: Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just -- I want to see if Jamal \r\ncalled. I was going to check the messages. I do. I have one message. So wait a \r\nsecond. ",

Hope and Gabby are fine, and I got to go. So I'll call you when I \r\ncan. I just called to say happy new year. I miss you. Bye. ",
        "Rafe: What did he say? ",

        "Woman: That's the reason why I came here, to open up my practice as far away \r\nas I could. I just got my degree in psychology, and -- ",

        "Frank: So you might know what the light actually hit? ",
        "Victor: But in order to find the exact center, I'm going to need some \r\nradiation equipment. So I -- I thought that I'll also need an extra pair of \r\nhands. ",
