        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Karen: Hey. You still on duty? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, just finishing up some paperwork and then I'm a free man. ",
        "Karen: Oh, lucky you. ",
        "Frank: I can give you another Scanlon special massage. ",
        "Karen: I haven't quite recovered from the first one. ",
        "Frank: I thought you liked it. ",
        "Karen: A little too much. I mean, you're liable to relax me to sleep, and \r\nthen where would my patients be? ",
        "Frank: How's Eve? ",
        "Karen: Well, they're finishing up her CAT scan results. We won't know \r\nanything till we see them. ",
        "Frank: You know what is crazy about this whole thing? We don't even get a \r\nchance to get used to her being alive and she could die. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, well, they'd better find the woman that did this to her. I'd \r\nlike to personally ask her what her damn hurry was. ",
        "",
        "Woman: Excuse me. There was a girl brought in this morning. I believe she was \r\nhit by a car. ",
        "Orderly: What about her? ",
        "Woman: Did she survive? Do you know where she is? ",
        "Orderly: I'm really sorry. All inquiries need to go to the front desk. ",
        "",
        "Ian's voice: Clearly I've lost my mind. This is what I wanted -- to have you \r\nwith me, to hold you, to make love to you and get lost in you. And now -- ",
        "Eve's voice: Why do we have to stop? ",
        "Ian's voice: Because I love you. And one moment in time couldn't nearly be enough.\r\n",
        "Eve's voice: I -- I don't understand. ",
        "Ian's voice: I don't just want you for one night. I want you for always. ",
        "Eve's voice: How can you be so sure? ",
        "Ian's voice: After everything we've been through, how can you not be? ",
        "Eve's voice: I've never known what it's like to sacrifice myself so completely for \r\nsomeone else and not feel like it's a sacrifice at all. You know? And I know \r\nthat you would do the same thing for me. ",
        "Ian's voice: Whenever you need it. ",
        "Eve's voice: That's why I can't walk away from this. I can't let you go. ",
        "Ian's voice: I won't let you. ",
        "Eve's voice: God, I didn't realize how hard this was going to be. Once I tell Kevin \r\nthat I'm in love with you, the fact that I'm alive might not be such good news.\r\n",
        "Ian's voice: I'm not moving from this place till you get back, I promise you. ",
        "Ian's voice: Eve! ",
        "Kevin's voice: Harris was your problem, not Eve's! But she got caught in the middle \r\nagain! ",
        "Ian's voice: I swear, if I could've prevented -- ",
        "Kevin's voice: You son of a bitch! I don't want excuses! My wife was taken from me! I \r\nthought she was dead! And now she might really die, thanks to you. ",
        "Ian's voice: Hey, Lambert. Come on, Eve. You're ok. You're ok. ",
        "Ian: Hey. What's happening? Where is she? ",
        "Karen: Well, we're still waiting for the CT results. ",
        "Ian: We've been waiting for hours. ",
        "Karen: It just seems that way. They're going as fast as they can. ",
        "Ian: Well, it's not fast enough. What if there's cerebral bleeding? ",
        "Karen: Ian, Eve's getting the best possible help thanks to you. If she lives, \r\nit's because of you. ",
        "Ian: If she dies, it's because of me. ",
        "Karen: You don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Ian: Do I not? If it hadn't been for me, she wouldn't have been kidnapped. If \r\nit hadn't  been for me, she wouldn't be in there fighting for her life. \r\nDon't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Eve? Get better. Do it for you, do it for me, I don't care. Just do \r\nwhatever it takes. And I'll make it up to you. I swear. ",
        "[Noise] ",
        "Kevin: Oh, Lucy. Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Um -- when I got out of the shower, you weren't there, so I just came \r\nhere to find you. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, God, Lucy, I'm so sorry. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: She's alive, Lucy. Eve's alive. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I mean, I can see that. ",
        "Kevin: It's just so unbelievable. But, Lucy, she's in there. She's fighting \r\nfor her life. ",
        "Lucy: I -- I don't understand. How did this happen? ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you at the lighthouse like that, but \r\n-- do you remember that noise we heard, I went out to check? ",
        "Lucy: It was Eve? ",
        "Kevin: She'd been hit by a car. She was walking away, crossing the street. \r\nLucy, that was her knocking on the door, and I didn't get up to answer it \r\nbecause -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: Because you and I were making love. ",
        "Lucy: Please, please -- don't do this to yourself, ok? ",
        "Kevin: But if I had gotten up and answered the door, this wouldn't have \r\nhappened. ",
        "Lucy: It's not your fault. This is not your fault. You -- you had no way of \r\nknowing she was still alive. ",
        "Kevin: You're right, you're right. How could any of us have known? What did \r\nthat DNA test say? 99.9% match? ",
        "Lucy: Uh-huh. ",
        "Kevin: Well, how could they get it so wrong? I mean, this is all just too \r\nincredible. ",
        "Lucy: What about Ian? Where's Ian? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, Ian's alive. Ian's fine. ",
        "Lucy: That's good. That's great. I got to go. I need to go. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no, Lucy, there's no reason for you to go. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I came here to find you. I just wanted to find you. This is not \r\nwhat I thought I'd find. I -- I just need to go think, ok, so I got to go. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no, Lucy, please, just for a minute. Marcela? Please? Would \r\nyou stay with Eve? I need a few minutes with Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: It's really -- it's ok, Doc. It's ok. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, it's not. ",
        "Marcela: Don't worry. I won't leave her alone. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Hey. Give me a minute, would you? ",
        "Marcela: Um, Dr. Collins doesn't want her left alone. ",
        "Ian: I'm not going anywhere, I promise. ",
        "Marcela: Sure, Dr. Thornhart. I've got plenty to do. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Are you ok? ",
        "Lucy: You shouldn't be worried about me, Doc. Yeah, I'm just -- I'm fine. You \r\nknow, I'm just worried about you. I can't imagine what's going through your head \r\nright now. ",
        "Kevin: I want to kill Ian. ",
        "Lucy: What happened? Where have they been all this time? ",
        "Kevin: Big surprise -- Eve got caught in Ian's crossfire. ",
        "Lucy: What does that mean? ",
        "Kevin: They were kidnapped. ",
        "Lucy: Kidnapped? ",
        "Kevin: Some old enemy of Ian's, a man by the name of Jordan Harris. He blew \r\nup the car, made it look like they were in it, and he's been holding them I \r\ndon't know where. ",
        "Lucy: Why? ",
        "Kevin: He had a terminal disease. Somehow he thought they could come up with \r\na cure. Anyway, they managed to escape. She was coming home. ",
        "Lucy: You mean they didn't -- I mean, they weren't having -- what exactly are \r\nyou trying to say that you mean? ",
        "Kevin: They were prisoners. Funny thing is Victor was already on Harris' \r\ntrail. ",
        "Lucy: Victor knew who set the car bomb? ",
        "Kevin: He suspected it and he was following up on it for me. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Of all the things I imagined, I -- I never for once thought about \r\nthem being kidnapped. ",
        "Kevin: Why would you? For all we knew, they were dead. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Why would I? I mean, we would never even have imagined that they \r\ncould still be alive. ",
        "Kevin: I wish we had. Maybe we would've found Eve earlier and this nightmare \r\nnever would've happened. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Here you go, Raj. ",
        "Raj: Sure. ",
        "Frank: What's up? ",
        "Karen: I'm meeting Dr. Kahn. I heard the CAT scan results were ready. Thanks.\r\n",
        "Frank: You want some company? I mean, if something turns up on that CT --\r\n",
        "Karen: Thanks, but I'm ok. ",
        "Frank: You sure? ",
        "Karen: Hey, I'm pretty tough when I need to be. ",
        "Frank: Eve is lucky to have you as a doctor and a friend. So if you change \r\nyour mind, page me, all right? ",
        "Woman: Excuse me. I'm checking on a patient. ",
        "Raj: Sure. Hold on a second. Detective Garcia. What can I do for you? ",
        "Garcia: Where can I find Frank Scanlon? ",
        "Raj: He was just here. ",
        "Garcia: Get him back for me, will you? Tell him I need to talk to him about \r\nthe hit-and-run. ",
        "Raj: Sure. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Come back to me, Eve. After everything we've been through and after \r\nloving you the way that I have and hearing that you love me -- those sweet words \r\n-- and I can't lose you now.",
        "",
        "Ian: Well, we might as well get this straight. ",
        "Kevin: What are you doing in here? I asked Marcela to stay. ",
        "Ian: Oh. Yeah, she told me and I promised -- and I promised I wouldn't \r\nleave. ",
        "Kevin: Then you can leave now. ",
        "Ian: I'm checking her condition. ",
        "Kevin: She's fighting for her life. Any questions? Good. Now, unless I have \r\nto get a restraining order to keep you away from my wife -- ",
        "Ian: What, you think I wanted this? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know, but you kept putting her in one situation after another. \r\nYou obviously had something in mind. ",
        "Ian: I spent the better part of the last month trying to keep her alive. The \r\nlast thing I wanted was for her to get hurt. ",
        "Kevin: Then take a good look before you leave. She's in a world of hurt now.\r\n",
        "Ian: When I brought her to your door, she was safe and sound. Now you tell \r\nme, Kevin -- what was so important that you couldn't answer? ",
        "Kevin: Get out. ",
        "Ian: I don't think so. That's Eve's call, not yours. ",
        "",
        "Frank: When we pulled up in the rig, the first thing I saw was the patient \r\nlying on the ground. ",
        "Garcia: Did you see the car that hit her? ",
        "Frank: It was stopped right there in the middle of the street, kind of at an \r\nangle. ",
        "Garcia: Did you see the driver? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, sure I did. It was a woman. ",
        "Garcia: Can you describe her? ",
        "Frank: I was right in the middle of working on Eve. I didn't exactly have \r\ntime to memorize the lady's face. ",
        "Garcia: Just give me what you can. ",
        "Frank: Uh -- dark hair, dark eyes, pretty. ",
        "Garcia: Long hair, short? ",
        "Frank: That's hard to say. Could've been short or it could've been worn kind \r\nof pulled back. ",
        "Garcia: Pulled back. Height, age? ",
        "Frank: Well, I would say mid 20s. As for height, I'm sorry. The best I could \r\nsay is average, and that's a guess. So what have you come up with so far? ",
        "Garcia: Not much. It was a rental car. She used a foreign license and a phony \r\nname, we think. FBI's running her prints, but she's not in the bank. ",
        "Frank: Wait, the feds are involved? ",
        "Garcia: Well, kidnapping is a federal offense. For all we know, Madam X could \r\nbe working for the guy who kidnapped Ian and Eve, trying to finish up the job.\r\n",
        "Frank: They're sure making hit men younger and better looking these days. ",
        "Garcia: You know what? Anything's possible. Why would someone run unless \r\nthey've got something to hide? ",
        "Frank: Have you thought about putting security on Eve? ",
        "Garcia: I want to talk to her husband about it. ",
        "",
        "Victor: There she is. Lucy. ",
        "Mary: Oh, Lucy. ",
        "Victor: Good heavens, is it true? Are they alive? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it's incredible, isn't it? ",
        "Mary: Well, Joe just told us the news. We can't believe it. It's -- it's a \r\nmiracle. ",
        "Lucy: Certainly is. ",
        "Mary: But I don't understand. We saw the car go up in flames. Nobody could \r\nhave survived that. ",
        "Lucy: Well, Eve and Ian weren't in the car. Apparently, Ian had some enemy \r\nthat made it look like they were in the car and were killed, but instead he took \r\nthem prisoner. ",
        "Victor: Was it Harris? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, Victor, it was. ",
        "Victor: I knew it, I knew it. I should've figured it out sooner. ",
        "Mary: But, darling, the evidence was so strong that they were killed, how \r\ncould you? ",
        "Victor: Well, it was the DNA. That's what fooled everybody. ",
        "Mary: They're alive. That's all that matters. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Mary, you're absolutely right. That's what's important. Not some \r\nsilly, unreliable DNA test. ",
        "Victor: No, Lucy, DNA is not unreliable. Actually, it's -- DNA typing is a \r\nwell-established form of science. ",
        "Mary: Yes, but, darling, if this man was so smart that he blew up a car with \r\ntwo bodies in it -- God rest their poor souls -- planted Eve's ring, took the \r\ntwo of them hostage, how hard could it have been for him to alter the results of \r\na test? ",
        "Lucy: Right. You're absolutely right. That's exact-- I hadn't thought of that \r\nbefore. ",
        "Victor: Well, it's possible, but I still want to look into it. How's Monk?\r\n",
        "Lucy: He's very worried. I was going to take him a cup of coffee. You know, \r\nhe's going to be very glad to see the two of you. ",
        "Mary: Can you imagine? He has a whole new life. He worshipped the ground she \r\nwalked on. The agony that he's been going through these past weeks, grieving for \r\nher -- I just -- we worried that maybe he wouldn't even survive himself. ",
        "Victor: Well, he's a strong man, Mary. ",
        "Mary: I know, darling. But to lose your wife, your soul mate? Now we're going \r\nto have to keep faith that she can make it through this, get through this and -- \r\nand have a long life together with Kevin. Have a lot of love and be happy. This \r\nis like a dream come true. ",
        "Victor: Sweetheart, would you -- would you find out if Eve is permitted to \r\nhave visitors? ",
        "Mary: Oh, yeah. I'll see who's on duty. Excuse me. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Victor: I kept your confidence. Even Mary doesn't know how you feel about \r\nMonk. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. It's ok. You know, all that stuff she was saying, she's \r\nright. She was just saying what she feels in her heart, and, you know, it really \r\nis. Having Eve alive again really is like a dream. ",
        "Victor: Except for you, it's something else, isn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Ian: There's been no change. BP's stable, so is the saturation. ",
        "Karen: Good. I have the CAT scan results. It's better than we hoped. ",
        "Kevin: Tell me. ",
        "Karen: Well, there's a hairline fracture, but the X-ray was negative for \r\nbleeds. ",
        "Ian: That's excellent. ",
        "Kevin: So no surgery? ",
        "Karen: No. Now, don't get me wrong. I mean, her condition is still serious, \r\nbut at least it's not life-threatening. ",
        "Kevin: So what's next? ",
        "Karen: Well, we have to wait for her to wake up, check her responses. Right \r\nnow that's the only way to rule out any additional damage. But if she's been as \r\nlucky as she has been so far, I'm thinking she could come out of this with no \r\nmajor residual effects. ",
        "Kevin: Thank God. Thank you. ",
        "Karen: No, you got it right the first time. You know, we're really lucky, \r\nKevin. There's every reason to believe that she'll be back to normal and ready \r\nto pick up her life exactly where she left off. ",
        "",
        "Garcia: She's in the ER, trauma five, but they'll be moving her to ICU soon. \r\nI've got Magnuson here if we need him. ",
        "Frank: You looking for someone? Nope, you're not getting away this time. ",
        "Woman: No, just -- ",
        "Garcia: Hold it right there. You're under arrest for felony hit-and-run and \r\nattempted murder. You have the right to remain silent. ",
        "",
        "Karen: I suppose he's necessary? ",
        "Kevin: It's the only way I can protect her right now. ",
        "Karen: Well, I'm going to find Dr. Kahn. He can check Eve over and answer \r\nyour questions. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you, Karen. ",
        "Ian: She's getting stronger. ",
        "Kevin: I know. Means you can leave now. ",
        "Ian: Excuse me? ",
        "Kevin: Policy's clear -- family only in ICU. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Well, I'm a doctor and Eve's my friend. I'm not going anywhere \r\nuntil I know for sure that she's out of trouble. Now if you like, we can talk \r\nabout this in front of her. Or perhaps you'd like to take another shot at me \r\nright here in the ICU. Maybe the right thing to do is to drop it. ",
        "",
        "Victor: Uh, Mary -- Lucy, maybe you'd better go on ahead of us. ",
        "Mary: But, darling, I cleared all of us to see Eve. ",
        "Victor: Well, I was just thinking that Lucy could give Monk a heads-up so he \r\nwon't be overwhelmed with all of us charging in on him. ",
        "Lucy: That might be a good idea. ",
        "Mary: Oh. Ok. We'll go get some coffee. ",
        "Victor: Perfect. Perfect. Well, we'll see you in a little bit. ",
