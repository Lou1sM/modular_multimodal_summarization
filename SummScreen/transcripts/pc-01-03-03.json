        "Ian (dreaming): What are you doing to \r\nme, Elizabeth? Stay away from me. No. ",
        "Lucy: Ian? ",
        "Ian: Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: It's time to wake up. \r\n",
        "Ian: You came for me. ",
        "Lucy: I'm all yours. ",
        "Ian: I need you, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then take me. Take me now.\r\n",
        "Ian: I can't. I won't. ",
        "Lucy: But I want you to. ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "Lucy: Please, Ian. ",
        "Ian: You don't know what I've become.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I know everything about you.\r\n",
        "Ian: And you still want me? \r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah. I want you even more. \r\nI want to feel your body next to mine. I want to feel your skin against my skin. \r\nI want to feel your teeth inside me. I want to feel those fangs on my skin. I \r\nwant to feed you.\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: I want you forever. I love you. \r\nI love everything you are. I crave you. Give it to me. Give me your gift. Give \r\nit to me now. ",
        "Ian: Forever. ",
        "Lucy: Forever, yes. ",
        "Ian (awake): Lucy, I thought you were \r\n-- ",
        "Lucy: I was beginning to worry about \r\nyou. That must've been some dream you were having. ",
        "Ian: It wasn't a dream. It was a \r\nnightmare. ",
        "",
        "Tess: I didn't kill Livvie. \r\n",
        "Kevin: Then tell me where my daughter \r\nis. ",
        "Tess: But I did tell you. ",
        "Kevin: No. You told me that she didn't \r\ncome out of the water, and then you told me that she's not dead. But I found you \r\nand Jack packing her clothes and lying through your teeth to me.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Jack didn't do anything. He was \r\njust protecting me. ",
        "Kevin: Yes. Because he knows something \r\nabout what happened, doesn't he? And now you're going to tell me. Now, what did \r\nyou do to her? ",
        "Tess: But I -- I -- ",
        "Kevin: Did you have a fight? \r\n",
        "Tess: No. ",
        "Kevin: Her wallet was found down here. \r\nYou had to know that she couldn't swim. Is that why you brought her here? \r\n",
        "Tess: I didn't bring her. I -- I \r\nfollowed her and -- and she fell in, and I tried to help her. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I bet you did. You know, \r\nshe told me about you. She told me you were some kind of a thing, and she was \r\nright. ",
        "Tess: No, no, I'm Tess. And I'm real \r\nand I love Livvie.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm sure you do. The only \r\nproblem is you're still walking around, and that's more than I can know for sure \r\nabout my daughter! ",
        "Tess: We're the same. She's not gone, \r\nshe's not dead. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if she's not gone and \r\nshe's not home and she's not dead, then where is she? ",
        "Tess: I'm protecting her. ",
        "Kevin: From what? ",
        "Tess: From everything or she will die.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Where is my daughter? \r\n",
        "Tess: She's inside me. ",
        "Kevin: She's what? ",
        "Tess: Here. Inside me. ",
        "Kevin: What kind of a freak are you?\r\n",
        "Tess: Please, you're hurting me. Just \r\n-- just feel. ",
        "Kevin: What's happening? What is it?\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Just feel. ",
        "Kevin: My God. Oh, my God. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: You attack my band, you call me \r\nout just to get my attention? ",
        "Rafe: It worked, didn't it? \r\n",
        "Caleb: You ever think of picking up \r\nthe phone? ",
        "Rafe: Tell me, Caleb, whatever \r\nhappened to the new Stephen -- you know, the one who wanted to live free in the \r\nworld, just feel the thrill of fame, the roar of the crowd, the worship of \r\nmillions? You know, the whole Stephen Clay Experience. That's what you said, \r\nright? Right? Just live and let live. That's what you said you wanted. \r\n",
        "Caleb: I got it, the best of both \r\nworlds. You, on the other hand, seem to be having little trouble adjusting.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Yeah, thanks to you! ",
        "Caleb: Hey, you can't be that pissed \r\noff that I married Alison's mother. ",
        "Rafe: And you turned her. ",
        "Caleb: Everybody needs a companion.\r\n",
        "Rafe: This whole thing -- this whole \r\nthing is just part of your master plan to mess with me and Alison. ",
        "Caleb: Ah, yeah, the happy couple. So \r\nwhat was it, anyway? Was it just prewedding jitters, or did Alison finally \r\nfigure out she could do so much better? ",
        "Rafe: Stop. All right, you know \r\nexactly what it was. Now, I don't know how you did it, and right now I don't \r\neven really care, but I do know that you planted those lies to make Alison think \r\nshe's my sister. ",
        "Caleb: Your sister? Is that why the \r\nwedding didn't happen? I'm sorry, that's just the worst break I ever heard \r\nabout. What can I say? Sorry.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: You set it up. ",
        "Caleb: You know, there are parts of \r\nthe world where that kind of thing doesn't matter too much. Maybe you and Alison \r\ncould move there. Having children might become a little awkward, but -- \r\n",
        "Rafe: Come on, vampire. Show me what \r\nyou got. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Are you all right? You seem --\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah, no -- I'm fine. It was a \r\nstrange night. How are you? What are you doing here? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm -- I'm good. Kevin's \r\nbeen acting a little strange lately -- ",
        "Ian: Kevin's not here. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: What's been going on in here? \r\nWhat have you been doing?\r\n\n",
        "Ian: I'm working. I'm -- I'm -- I'm \r\ndoing some work here, so you need to go home. You need to just go, please.\r\n",
        "Lucy: You don't look like you're in \r\nany condition to do any work. ",
        "Ian: I just have a fever or flu or \r\nsomething. It'll pass. Nothing that you need to concern yourself with. \r\n",
        "Lucy: Come here. ",
        "Ian: I said go! ",
        "Lucy: You're burning up. ",
        "Ian: I'm fine! Did you not hear me? \r\nGo! ",
        "Lucy: Where did you go after the \r\nwedding? ",
        "Ian: Excuse me? ",
        "Lucy: After the wedding broke up and \r\nAlison and Rafe left and I told you about Elizabeth and Caleb, where did you go?\r\n\n",
        "Ian: I went home, I checked on my \r\nchild, and I came here. ",
        "Lucy: That's all? ",
        "Ian: That's all. What are you asking \r\nme? ",
        "Lucy: Just tell me, where did you go \r\nafter the wedding? Did you go see Caleb? Did you go see him? ",
        "Ian: No more questions. ",
        "Lucy: Ian, please tell me, did you go?\r\n",
        "Ian: You need to leave now, please. \r\nGod! Oh! ",
        "Lucy: Ian -- oh. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Good shot, Rafe. You always \r\nwere pretty quick. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Got a lot more where that \r\ncame from. ",
        "Caleb: And while I'm flattered at your \r\nbelief in my power to manipulate your life, just because you're a freak, you're \r\nnot blaming me for your little brother/sister love nest.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: It has you written all over it!\r\n",
        "Caleb: Ok, say you're right. Tell me \r\nhow I orchestrate a feat like that, hmm? What evidence do I plant to convince \r\nyour fianc\u00e9e -- I mean your ex-fianc\u00e9e to kick her big brother to the curb, hmm? \r\nYou don't know, do you? ",
        "Rafe: I'll find out. ",
        "Caleb: What if you're wrong, hmm? What \r\nif this is another pathetic attempt by you to blame me for the disaster you call \r\nyour life? ",
        "Rafe: You will tell me the truth.\r\n",
        "Caleb: Or what? Or what, Rafe? What \r\nare you going to do? You can't kill me. As a matter of fact, what the hell are \r\nwe even doing here right now?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: That -- that's a good question. \r\nThat's a really good question. But you know what? Let's be more specific about \r\nthat. What are you doing here, Caleb, huh? What are you really doing here? It's \r\nnot just for the fame. So let's see, what could it be? Oh, I think I know.\r\n",
        "Caleb: I can't wait. Thrill me with \r\nyour theory. ",
        "Rafe: You still want Livvie. \r\n",
        "[Caleb imitates buzzer] ",
        "Caleb: Wrong. Guess again. ",
        "Rafe: No, you want her so bad that you \r\ncan taste it. That's how I finally discovered your true colors. Remember? You \r\nwere standing there, watching as Livvie was making it with your drummer. That \r\nhad to hurt.\r\n\n",
        "Caleb: You're crossing the line, \r\nslayer. I was just in the neighborhood. ",
        "Rafe: What's the matter, vampire? \r\nDidn't all your little buddies in hell warn you about her? ",
        "Rafe: Looking for me, vampire? \r\n",
        "Caleb: Huh. You're going to have to do \r\na lot better than that, slayer. ",
        "Rafe: Where's your precious Livvie \r\nnow, huh? Not here, not by your side? ",
        "Caleb: You know, Rafe, this has just \r\ngrown tiresome. There ain't nothing you can tell me about Olivia that I don't \r\nalready know. ",
        "Rafe: No? Well, then maybe both of us \r\ncan visit some of Livvie's greatest hits. A little trip down memory lane, if you \r\nwill. Take a look.\r\n\n",
        "Caleb: Is that the best you got?\r\n",
        "Rafe: No. No, this little show is just \r\nto remind you of every time your precious Olivia failed you. ",
        "Caleb: Well, this is fascinating. I \r\nshould have brought popcorn. ",
        "Rafe: When she was with Ricky, where \r\nwere you? Outside the door, your mouth twitching, fangs desperate for blood. And \r\nall for what? ",
        "Caleb: You know, if I would have known \r\nyou liked dirty pictures so much, I would have downloaded a few of my own.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Oh, you don't like these? How \r\nabout these? A little more personal. How did it feel the first time, Caleb, when \r\nyou were lured onto the roof, when the lightning seared your flesh and turned \r\nyour bones to dust? Was it \"fascinating\" then, the joy of joys? Where was your \r\nbride-to-be then? When you opened your soul to your vampire bride and the stake \r\ntore through your chest, was she beautiful then, through your skeleton eyes? \r\nWhen she killed you for the second time?\r\n\n",
        "Caleb: That's enough. ",
        "Rafe: Ah. Memorable, huh? ",
        "[Rafe chuckles] ",
        "Rafe: I've got more. ",
        "Caleb: I think you made your point, \r\nRafe. And your point is precisely nothing, nada. You know all this proves? It \r\nproves how beautiful Olivia is, how passionate she is, and that the only thing \r\nthat stood between us was human frailty. And no matter how hard you study, you \r\nwill never understand our world. ",
        "\nRafe: And you'll never be able to live \r\nin ours because your frailty is to love someone who will betray you again and \r\nagain and again and again. ",
        "Caleb: Huh.\u00a0\r\n",
        "Caleb: Is the show over now, slayer?\r\n",
        "Rafe: Hmm. No. I'm just getting warmed \r\nup. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I can't move. What are you \r\ndoing? ",
        "Tess: You're so angry. ",
        "Kevin: There's something else -- \r\nsomething else I'm feeling. ",
        "Tess: It's the beating of your heart.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Tess: When Livvie and I found each \r\nother, she was fearful like you, afraid, filled with terrible, terrible pain. \r\nBut there is goodness inside. The light in her heart is still pure and untouched \r\nby evil things. And there's goodness in yours, too. I can feel it. You're hurt \r\ninside. You don't want to hurt me. You don't mean to hurt me.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: Yes, I -- I feel that. \r\n",
        "Tess: Just -- just feel. You'll never \r\nforget this feeling. You don't have to be angry anymore. ",
        "Kevin: I feel it. ",
        "Tess: Well, now you know. ",
        "Kevin: Get your hand off me! Don't \r\never touch me again, you freak! ",

        "[Ian groans] ",
        "Ian: Ok. Pain's gone. That's better. \r\nThat's weird, huh? ",
        "Lucy: You're not better. You're not \r\nbetter. ",
        "Ian: I'm fine. Just take my word for \r\nit. I'm sorry I yelled at you. ",
        "Lucy: It's ok. Do you understand what \r\njust happened? That reaction isn't normal. You know, you have to --\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Lucy, enough. ",
        "Lucy: No, Ian, please -- ",
        "Ian: I didn't see Caleb after the \r\nwedding, ok? Are you happy? You satisfied? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, fine. Then tell me who you \r\ndid see. ",
        "Ian: I'm asking you nicely, please go.\r\n",

        "Ian: Lucy, please. ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm not going. I'm not going \r\nto leave you no matter what, so you're going to tell me. I'm not going no matter \r\nwhat you do, so tell me, please. Ian, please. Please. ",
        "Ian: I can't. ",
        "Ian's voice: I got to find your \r\nhusband. There's some things you don't know about him, and I don't feel \r\ncomfortable leaving you here.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth's voice: Sometimes you just \r\nhave to do things. ",
        "Ian's voice: What? ",
        "Elizabeth's voice: I said I can smell \r\nthe blood in your veins. ",

        "Elizabeth's voice: Ah. It's perfect \r\nwhen you don't fight me. Just let yourself go. ",
        "Ian's voice: No. ",
        "Elizabeth's voice: Oh, you are so \r\nalive, so sensual. I am going to make you feel things you never knew existed.\r\n",
        "Ian's voice: What the hell have you \r\nbecome? What have you done to me? ",
        "Lucy: Come on, you -- you can tell me. \r\nWe can figure out what's happening. Don't -- don't you think I care? Don't you \r\nwant me to care about --\r\n\n",
        "Ian: You care, you care. No, I care. I \r\ncare about you. I care too much about you. You need to go. ",
        "Lucy: No. Ian, no, I'm not -- \r\n",
        "Ian: What do you want from me? What? \r\nWhy are you staring at me? What do you want? You think I can just take you in my \r\narms and everything's going to be all right? ",
