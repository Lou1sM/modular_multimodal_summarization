        "Jamal: What -- what? What's wrong? ",
        "Alison: It's freezing in here. ",
        "Jamal: I see. Hogging all the covers. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, I'm just cold. ",
        "Jamal: Oh. Come here, come here, come here, come here. Come here, come here. \r\nHow's that? Hmm? ",
        "Alison: It's not working. ",
        "Jamal: Hmm. If that's the case, then there's only one thing left to do. ",
        "Alison: Fire up the space heater? ",
        "Jamal: No, I was thinking maybe we could make our own heat, baby. ",
        "Alison: Oh, Jamal, if you think for one second that I am going to take off \r\nthese flannel jammies and my two pairs of long johns, you are crazy, ok? ",
        "Jamal: All right, all right, all right. Move. ",
        "Jamal: Oh. Grumpy -- oh. ",
        "[Alison shivers] ",
        "Alison: Hurry, hurry, before I officially become an icicle. ",
        "Jamal: All right, all right. It's already on. It's on. It's on, it's on, it's \r\non. ",
        "Alison: Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you. I knew there was a reason I was \r\nso crazy about you. ",
        "Jamal: Because of my space heater, right? Oh, that's great. ",
        "Alison: Among other things. ",
        "Jamal: I just thought you said you were too cold to, you know. ",
        "Alison: I'm starting to thaw. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa -- ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, whoa! ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Oh. ",
        "Alison: I know this looks really bad, but maybe, just maybe, we could use \r\nthis to our advantage. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: Yes? Yes, it's me, I'm right here. ",
        "Eve: Ian -- ",
        "Ian: Oh, I'm here, too. ",
        "Kevin: Eve, I can't believe you came back to me. ",
        "Eve: Kevin -- ",
        "Kevin: What is it? Eve, what are you trying to say? ",
        "Eve: Where am I? ",
        "Kevin: You're at G.H. You were in an accident. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: Are you in pain? ",
        "[Eve sighs] ",
        "Eve: My head hurts. ",
        "Ian: Your vitals are ok. Let me get Karen. ",
        "Eve: Ooh. ",
        "Kevin: It's ok. You're home now. You're safe. Oh, God, I can't tell you what \r\nit feels like to see you again. I thought I'd lost you forever. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Karen: I just got paged. Well, look who finally decided to wake up. Hello.\r\n",
        "Eve: Hi, Karen. ",
        "Kevin: She's still a little disoriented. ",
        "Ian: She said her head hurts. ",
        "Karen: Well, it's probably the residual effects from the head trauma, but let \r\nme check her out just to be sure. ",
        "Kevin: Ian and I will wait outside for a minute. I'll be right back. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: So will I. ",
        "Karen: Ok, this won't take long, just a minute or two. ",
        "Kevin: Look, Ian, I appreciate your concern for Eve, I really do. But she's \r\nawake now and her CAT scan was negative. ",
        "Ian: I'm not going anywhere until I know she's all right. ",
        "Kevin: Even if it's not what's best for her? ",
        "Ian: What's that supposed to mean? ",
        "Kevin: I'll tell you what it means. Seeing you, being reminded of what you \r\ntwo just went through is the last thing that she needs. ",
        "Karen: Well, everything checks out. ",
        "Kevin: Do you mind if I go back in? ",
        "Karen: Sure. She's just a little knocked out from the drugs. ",
        "Kevin: That's ok. I just want to be with her. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, of course. ",
        "Kevin: Thanks. ",
        "Karen: I'll be back soon. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: If you don't mind, I'd like a moment alone with my wife. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Oh -- brr. ",
        "Jamal: Ooh. Everything -- everything for the whole apartment is blown. \r\nFrank's going to have to call an electrician in the morning. ",
        "Alison: Oh, now, wait a second. If you think for one minute that I can go all \r\nnight without electricity, you are crazy. ",
        "Jamal: What do you need so bad? ",
        "Alison: Jamal, hello? I need my hair dryer and my sonic toothbrush and my \r\ncappuccino maker. I need my coffee. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, Ali, Ali, Ali, you can go one day without all those \r\nthings. ",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry, but I am not a camper, ok? There's only one answer. We \r\nneed to go get a hotel. ",
        "Jamal: A hotel? What? No, no, that's your big proposition? No. ",
        "Alison: Wait, you didn't let me finish. I was thinking that it would be, you \r\nknow, really romantic. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on, what can we do in a hotel that we can't do right here, \r\nhmm? ",
        "Alison: Well, first of all, I wouldn't be too cold to take off all my 12 \r\nlayers of clothes. And, second, I find a change in scenery very inspiring. ",
        "Jamal: Hmm -- ",
        "Alison: Hmm? ",
        "Jamal: No -- no, no, you know, forget it. No -- no, we can't afford it, Ali. \r\nNo, we can't. ",
        "Alison: No, really, we can, ok? See, because I have collected all my tips and \r\nstuff and it's not like we have to stay at the Ritz. Ok, we can stay somewhere \r\ncheap. Would that make you happy? ",
        "Jamal: Well, what would make me happy is if we stay right here, really. ",
        "Alison: Even if that means that you would be missing out on the most sexy, \r\nromantic, electric night with the woman you love? ",
        "Jamal: Hmm -- are we talking about the same one that doesn't stop until she \r\ngets what she wants? ",
        "Alison: Exactly. ",
        "Jamal: All right. All right, go pack. Go, go, go. ",
        "Alison: Yes, yes, yes-yes-yes! Oh, this will be great, ok? Listen to me, I am \r\ngoing to give you a night that you will never, ever forget. ",
        "Jamal: Ah! ",
        "",
        "Victor: No, no. No, no. Let's dig as deep as we can while we've still got her \r\nin custody. I'll be in touch. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Victor: Lucy, hi. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my clothes. Thank you. I really appreciate that. What was that \r\nphone call all about? ",
        "Victor: They've arrested the woman who ran over Eve. We're checking now to \r\nsee if she might in some way be connected to Jordan Harris or to the operation \r\nto kidnap Eve and Ian. ",
        "Lucy: They think that maybe the woman ran over Eve on purpose? ",
        "Victor: It's certainly possible. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Well, I -- I have some good news. Eve's awake. ",
        "Victor: Oh, she is? That's great. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it's great. ",
        "Victor: Oh. I'm sorry. All of this puts you in a very awkward position, \r\ndoesn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Well, it puts me in a very bad movie where I am the woman who has \r\nprofessed my love to my true soul mate, only to have his dead wife come back. So \r\nnow this woman feels like she's out in the cold with her heart ripped out. ",
        "Victor: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Lucy: Hey, well, you know, it's just, I watch Kevin with Eve and he seems so \r\ndevoted, and then I try to keep reminding myself that he's just playing a part, \r\nyou know, of the loyal husband because that's what he has to do under these \r\ncircumstances. That's what he feels like he has to do, right? ",
        "Victor: Lucy, Monk isn't pretending. He does love Eve, and if there's one \r\nthing Monk is it's loyal. ",
        "Lucy: Can you say the same thing about Eve? ",
        "Victor: What do you mean? ",
        "Lucy: Well, do you honestly believe that nothing happened between Eve and Ian \r\nwhile they were locked up together all alone like that? ",
        "Victor: Oh, I see where this is going. In your movie, Ian and Eve fall in \r\nlove, thereby opening the door for Kevin and Lucy. Is that about it? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, if I was writing this movie, that would be it. That would be my \r\nhappy ending. I think it'd be happy for everybody. ",
        "Victor: Lucy, things don't work out like that, not in real life. ",
        "Lucy: Maybe not. But you know what they say, the movie's not over till it's \r\nover, right? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I'll make it up to you, Eve. I swear. Just get better. Please, just \r\nget better. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Girl, we are staying one night in a motel. We're not going on a \r\ncruise. ",
        "Alison: I know. If we were going on a cruise, I would have brought the big \r\nbag. ",
        "Jamal: Look, before we go through all this, just let me see how much you \r\nsaved there from these tips of yours. ",
        "Alison: You don't think I can save. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. It's just, I want to make sure we have enough for the \r\nroom. ",
        "Alison: The room and room service. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, boy. ",
        "Man: Hey, which way's the bar? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, bar's closed, homey. ",
        "Man: Oh. Well, hey, you got any -- ",
        "Jamal: No. No, sorry, man. You might as well just keep stepping. ",
        "Man: You're no fun. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. Come on, girl, give me my money. ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok. It's all there. Go ahead and count it. Not bad, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Ooh. ",
        "Man: Hey, hey. ",
        "Jamal: That's not bad. ",
        "Man: How much for the pretty lady? ",
        "Jamal: Well, hold on. What'd you say, man? ",
        "Alison: Excuse me? ",
        "Man: Hold it, honey. I'm talking to your mac daddy here. ",
        "Jamal: Wait, hold on, hold on. Let me explain something to you, man. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God! ",
        "Jamal: She is not no hooker, all right? ",
        "Man: So what are you going to tell me next, huh? Pretty blonde's your \r\ngirlfriend? ",
        "Jamal: Wait, who you think you're talking to like that, huh? You don't talk \r\nthat. Apologize! ",
        "Man: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: Apologize! ",
        "Man: I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: Get the hell out of here, man. ",
        "Man: All right, I'm going. But I won't forget. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I'm right here. ",
        "Alison: What was with that guy? ",
        "Jamal: Nothing. He ain't the only one. ",
        "Alison: What does that mean? ",
        "Jamal: Welcome to the real world. ",
        "",
        "Victor: They said she was awake. ",
        "Kevin: She was, but the painkillers knocked her out. ",
        "Victor: This is incredible. Eve, alive. ",
        "Kevin: I know. I can't believe it myself. But I'm worried about her, Victor.\r\n",
        "Victor: Why? I spoke to Karen. She said everything's going fine. ",
        "Kevin: It's not her physical health I'm talking about. What she went through. \r\nThe fear. The terror. Every minute, not knowing if she'd ever make it out. ",
        "Victor: But that's -- that's over now. ",
        "Kevin: That's what she thought. She thought it was all over. So she comes \r\nhome to the one person she thought could make her safe, but I wasn't there, \r\nVictor. I wasn't there! And now I don't know if it'll ever be over. ",
        "Victor: Of course it will because you're here now. ",
        "Kevin: No, you don't understand. This accident never should have happened. I \r\nnever should have let her leave the Recovery Room the night of the explosion. I \r\nshould have stopped her from getting into Ian's car. And I should have known \r\nsomehow that she wasn't really dead. ",
        "Victor: Oh, Monk, how could you? The DNA report confirmed -- ",
        "Kevin: I should have figured it out somehow. And at the very least, I \r\nshould have answered the door instead of leaving her out on the front porch \r\nknocking. ",
        "Victor: Monk, please. Please, don't do this to yourself. ",
        "Kevin: Why not? I'm the reason that she's lying there. It's my fault. It's my \r\nfault. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Hey. Large coffee to go, please. Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Make it for here and I'll buy. ",
        "Ian: Sweet Lucy, hi. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. Hi. ",
        "Ian: Oh, it's good to see you. ",
        "Lucy: I'm so glad you're alive and you're back. I mean, I think. I mean, I'm \r\nglad you're alive, but are you glad you're back? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, I wish it were under different circumstances. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Me, too. It must have been really awful being held hostage. I \r\nmean, you and Eve being held hostage like that. ",
        "Ian: I did what I had to, to get her back to her husband. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'm sure you did, but I'm sure she was very glad that you care so \r\nmuch about her, to have someone like that with her, you know. I mean, really, \r\nyou two must have had a lot of time to get close while you were -- ",
        "Ian: What are you asking me? ",
        "Lucy: Oh. I don't know, but I think you do. ",
        "Ian: Leave it. ",
        "Lucy: I can't. Ian, look, I really do need to know, please. ",
        "Ian: What you need and what I need is going to have to wait, ok? Eve is up \r\nthere in the ICU, and until she feels better, maybe we can put this little \r\ndiscussion on what we did during our Christmas vacation on hold. Ok? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Oh. Here. ",
        "Waitress: Thank you. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. Bye. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Lucy: I so hope you did what I did on your Christmas vacation. ",
        "",
        "Alison: I don't see why you had to let that guy ruin our plans. We could be \r\nin a nice, cozy hotel right now. ",
        "Jamal: I just don't feel like partying right now, ok? ",
        "Alison: Well, I still can't believe he thought that I was a hooker. Why would \r\nhe think that? ",
        "Jamal: Because you were with me. ",
        "Alison: And? ",
        "Jamal: And he thought that people like me couldn't get with people like you.\r\n",
        "Alison: That's the lamest thing I ever heard. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you know, you better get used to it because that's the way it \r\nis. ",
        "Alison: No, I'm not going to get used to it because that is so 1960s. Please.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well -- ",

        "Alison: Jamal, don't! Don't! Forget about it! ",
        "Jamal: Forget -- what do you mean, \"forget about it\"? What do you mean, \r\n\"forget about it\"? ",
        "Alison: Look, the bike can be fixed. I cannot get another you. ",
        "Jamal: Well, it ain't -- it ain't just the bike. It's everything. ",
        "Alison: No. No, it doesn't matter. None of it matters, Jamal. ",

        "Ian: Oh. Do you mind if I go in? ",
        "Karen: No. In fact, I just got paged to surgery. ",
        "Ian: Good. I'll keep an eye on her, don't worry. ",
        "Karen: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Hey. Lambert. I know you have a lot on your mind right now, but I need \r\nyou to focus on getting better, ok? And don't worry about me and Kevin and all \r\nthat. That can wait. What I want right now is for you to get back to your \r\nfeisty, stubborn self as soon as possible. Do you know what?

        "Kevin: No, you're not. Lucy, I'm sorry I haven't been there for you. ",
        "Lucy: That's ok. I understand. You have an obligation to Eve, and I'm -- I've \r\njust -- I've got to give you some space, you know, until you can get everything \r\nstraightened out. ",

        "Kevin: Lucy, last night was -- was just incredible. It was like it was meant \r\nto be, like where I was supposed to be. But that was before I knew Eve was \r\nalive. Lucy, she almost died trying to get back to me. And she's still in so \r\nmuch pain, physical, emotional. But beyond all of that, she's my wife. ",
        "Lucy: What -- what are you -- what are you trying to say to me? ",
