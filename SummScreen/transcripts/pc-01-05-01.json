        "Garcia: You're accused of felony hit-and-run and attempted murder in an \r\naccident involving Dr. Eve Lambert. Did you hear what I said? ",
        "Arianna: Yes, I heard. ",
        "Garcia: Your arraignment's today. You still have time to call your own \r\nattorney. ",
        "Arianna: Look, I told you before, I don't need one. ",
        "Garcia: You do if you're working for Jordan Harris. ",
        "Arianna: Who? ",
        "Garcia: And you hit Dr. Lambert intentionally. ",
        "Arianna: Look, it was an accident! ",
        "Garcia: Well, then why'd you run? What are you hiding? Look, you're obviously \r\nin way over your head and you need help. From what I understand, your \r\ncourt-appointed attorney is on the way. ",
        "Scott: Hey, Garcia. You must be my new client. ",
        "",
        "[Eve moans] ",
        "Ian: Eve. Hey. Are you all right? I told you you would be. Promised you. I \r\nlove you. Always have. We're going to have a life together. We'll have a future, \r\nI promise you. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I know that -- I know this isn't what you want to hear. Oh, and \r\nI don't want to hurt you. ",
        "Lucy: Then don't. Don't, Doc. All you need is -- is just a little time. ",
        "Kevin: No, Lucy. As wonderful as last night was, it has to be over. ",
        "Lucy: Like hell it does. ",
        "",
        "Garcia: You're the attorney on this case? ",
        "Scott: Yep. Doing the pro bono work, Garcia. ",
        "Garcia: But how can you do it? ",
        "Scott: Tell me about it. I've been working like a field hand lately. ",
        "Garcia: No, no, no, I'm talking about this particular case. ",
        "Scott: Why's that? ",
        "Garcia: You haven't read the report? ",
        "Scott: I was in the middle of lunch, I got the call. You know, I just got \r\nover here. ",
        "Garcia: Well, then you don't know what happened. ",
        "Scott: Yes, I do. It was a hit-and-run. My name's Scott Baldwin. What's your \r\nname? ",
        "Arianna: I don't want your help. ",
        "Scott: That's a very nice name. Garcia, let me have a few minutes with my \r\nclient. ",
        "Garcia: I think you'd better take a look at the report first. ",
        "Scott: All right, let's see. Says here you were driving late the other night \r\nin a rented car. False I.D. You hit someone. You left the scene of the accident. \r\nThey suspect you might have hit intentionally. ",
        "Arianna: I did not. ",
        "Garcia: The investigation's still open. It's a possibility we're looking \r\ninto. ",
        "Scott: What makes you think it was intentional? ",
        "Garcia: Keep reading. ",
        "Scott: So? What? ",
        "Garcia: You'll know when you see who the victim is. ",
        "Scott: Eve Lambert? ",
        "Garcia: That's right. ",
        "Scott: Garcia, Eve is dead. ",
        "Garcia: She's not. ",
        "Scott: Are you telling me that Eve is alive? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Joe. ",
        "Joe: Yeah. Just me. ",
        "Ian: What are you doing here? ",
        "Joe: Well, I figured you were getting a little ripe by now, so I brought you \r\na change of clothes. ",
        "Ian: Thanks. ",
        "Joe: So you want to tell me what's going on here? ",
        "Ian: What? Friend of mine's in trouble. I'm trying to comfort her. ",
        "Joe: It's more than that. You know it. So do I. And other people will, too, \r\nif you aren't careful. That could've been Kevin that walked in here, and he's a \r\nmess already. ",
        "Ian: I know how upset Kevin is. I'm aware of it. He has every right to be. I \r\nput Eve in harm's way. But I swear to you, I tried to get her home safe. ",
        "Joe: And you did. Now she's back -- with her husband. That's just what you \r\nwanted, right? Come on, Ian, you forget -- I know how you felt about Eve. And \r\nthat's why you decided to leave Port Charles. ",
        "Ian: Yes, but it didn't happen. We were kidnapped and thrown in together. ",
        "Joe: So what? What happened? What happened while you were gone? ",
        "Ian: Things changed, Joe. ",
        "Joe: With who? You? No. Eve changed. She fell in love with you, too. That's \r\nwhat happened. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Doc, it is not over between us. It can't be. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, things have changed. ",
        "Lucy: No, no, they haven't. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: Listen to me. ",
        "Lucy: No, you listen to me. I -- I love you. I told you I love you. And we \r\nadmitted to each other that we're soul mates. We always have been and we both \r\nknow that, and I know you love me. Otherwise, you couldn't have made love to me \r\nlike that. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I thought Eve was dead. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, then maybe we wouldn't have slept together if you had known \r\nthat. But you know how you feel about me, Doc. You know that. And you know you \r\nhave felt that way a long, long time -- before you even knew Eve was gone. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please, listen to me -- Eve was kidnapped. She's been through \r\nGod only knows what and she almost died last night for real because I didn't \r\nanswer the door, because -- ",
        "Lucy: I know why. Because we were making love. Is that what this is about? Is \r\nit guilt? Do you feel guilty? ",
        "Kevin: She's in the hospital. She's in intensive care. She needs me. I can't \r\njust walk away from her. ",
        "Lucy: Then tell me you can walk away from me. ",
        "Kevin: This isn't the time or the place for that, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, it is. You look at me and you look right in my eyes and you tell \r\nme right now that you can just get up and walk away from me and never look back. \r\nGo ahead, you say it. Say it. ",
        "Lucy: You can't do it, can you? ",
        "",
        "Scott: Garcia, what are you talking about? ",
        "Garcia: I thought you already knew about Eve. ",
        "Scott: I knew that Eve was blown up in a car with Thornhart. ",
        "Garcia: Apparently not. ",
        "Scott: But they got the DNA results back. ",
        "Garcia: I know, and we're checking into that, but it wasn't them in that car.\r\n",
        "Scott: Who was in the car and where's Eve been? ",
        "Garcia: She was with Thornhart. They had been kidnapped by an enemy of his -- \r\nJordan Harris. They managed to escape and make their way back to Port Charles, \r\nand that's when she was hit crossing the street from the lighthouse. ",
        "Scott: Is she ok? ",
        "Garcia: Well, she's at the hospital now. I don't know any more than that. ",
        "Scott: Well, what makes you think that it wasn't an accident? ",
        "Garcia: We're looking into the possibility that your new client is working \r\nfor Harris' organization. ",
        "Scott: Is that true? Did you come here to kill Eve? ",
        "Arianna: God, no! I've never even heard of this Harris person everybody keeps \r\ntalking about. ",
        "Scott: Garcia, let me have a couple of minutes, ok? ",
        "Scott: So where were you driving to? ",
        "Arianna: I was just passing through. ",
        "Scott: Passing through? That's not exactly a highway. ",
        "Arianna: I got lost. ",
        "Scott: Where were you headed? ",
        "Arianna: New York City. ",
        "Scott: New York is south. You were going north. Where are you from? ",
        "Arianna: Albany. ",
        "Scott: Originally! ",
        "Arianna: I don't have to answer that. ",
        "Scott: What is your real name? ",
        "Arianna: I don't have to tell you anything. ",
        "Scott: Listen, the hell you do! You're going to answer some questions here.\r\n",
        "Garcia: Hey, hey, hey. What's going on? ",
        "Scott: Garcia, just let me have a couple of minutes. ",
        "Garcia: Scott, come on. ",
        "Scott: Everything's under control. ",
        "Garcia: Listen -- ",
        "Scott: No, no, no, listen, I'm telling you, I need to talk to her for a \r\nlittle bit. ",
        "Garcia: You want to get this case thrown out of court? Now, come on, let's \r\ngo. ",
        "Scott: Garcia, I'm going to tell you something -- she's hiding something \r\nhere. ",
        "Garcia: Yeah, I know, and that's what we're trying to find out, but leave \r\nthat to us, ok? Go see Eve. I'll tell the judge there was a conflict of \r\ninterests here. We'll get her another attorney. ",
        "Scott: Yeah, you're going to get her another attorney because if I find out \r\nthat she had anything to do with trying to kill Eve, I'll make sure that she \r\nspends the rest of her life in Sing Sing. ",
        "",
        "Joe: Ian -- ",
        "Joe: Look, I understand how close you and Eve might have gotten while you \r\nwere away. ",
        "Ian: Away? What do you think this was, some kind of a holiday? ",
        "Joe: I'm just trying to make some sense out of this, ok? But this is Eve \r\nwe're talking about here. It wasn't all that long ago that she and Kevin got \r\nmarried. I was at their wedding. It wasn't just for show. They were crazy about \r\neach other. ",
        "Ian: They were having problems. ",
        "Joe: That they were trying to work out. ",
        "Ian: They didn't work them out. ",
        "Joe: No, she fell in love with you. Look, Ian, are you sure she feels the \r\nsame way about you? ",
        "Ian: Am I? No, it's some fantasy in my head. Yes, I'm sure. What are you \r\nsuggesting? ",
        "Joe: Look, maybe -- I'm just saying if she wasn't so vulnerable that -- ",
        "Ian: That what? What do you think, I persuaded her to fall in love with me? \r\nHuh? That when we were locked up, I used that time to take advantage of her? For \r\nthe love of God, Joseph. I tried my best to stay away from her. And not just in \r\nthat filthy dungeon but right here in Port Charles. That's why I was leaving \r\ntown. ",
        "Joe: Look, Ian, I'm not blaming you here. I know -- I know -- I know you \r\ndidn't set out for this to happen. ",
        "Ian: But it did happen and it was real. And, Joseph, I've never felt anything \r\nlike this in my life. To love like this and to be loved -- I'm not letting it \r\ngo. Soon as she wakes up, I'll -- ",
        "Joe: She's going to tell Kevin, isn't she? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I knew it. I knew it, Doc. I knew you couldn't just walk away from me. \r\nI know you can't just turn off the feelings you have for me. ",
        "Kevin: But I can't just turn my back on Eve. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I wouldn't want you to, especially while she's lying in a \r\nhospital bed. ",
        "Kevin: It's not just for that reason. ",
        "Lucy: I also know that it's because you have a commitment. And after \r\neverything she's been through, I understand that, Doc, I do. ",
        "Kevin: I'm not sure you do. ",
        "Lucy: Don't worry about me. You know, I -- I can wait as long as it takes now \r\nthat I know I have something to wait for. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I don't want you to get the wrong idea. Yes, I have feelings for \r\nyou. ",
        "[Kevin sighs] ",
        "Kevin: And, no, I can't just turn them off. But I have feelings for Eve, too, \r\nand they go beyond commitment. And I can't guarantee how this will play out. ",
        "Lucy: It's in the hands of the universe now, and I know -- I know it's going \r\nto work out for the best. ",
        "Kevin: Someone's going to get hurt, and that never works out for the best.\r\n",
        "Lucy: But there is one thing I trust more than fate, more than the universe, \r\nand that -- Doc, that's us and what we mean to each other, what we've always \r\nmeant to each other. ",
        "Victor: Monk, there you are. Thank goodness. I've been looking everywhere for \r\nyou. ",
        "Lucy: Hi, Victor. ",
        "Victor: Oh, Lucy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ignore you. Just been looking \r\nhigh and low for Monk. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. Why? What happened? ",
        "Victor: There's news about Eve's kidnapping. I've heard from some of my \r\nsources. ",
        "Kevin: Did they find Harris' body? ",
        "Victor: No, no, but they're working on it. They're finally beginning to close \r\nin on the person who altered the DNA results. It looks as if we'll know very \r\nsoon who it was who wanted you to think that Eve was dead. ",
        "",
        "Joe: This is going to kill Kevin, hearing Eve say she's fallen in love with \r\nyou. ",
        "Ian: It'll kill me if Eve doesn't. ",
        "Garcia: Excuse me, Dr. Thornhart? Could I have a word with you in private?\r\n",
        "Joe: Yeah, I'm going to check on Eve. ",
        "Ian: What do you want? ",
        "Garcia: Some new information just came in on the hit-and-run. ",
        "Ian: And? ",
        "Garcia: Forensics ruled it an accident. Based on the investigation of the car \r\nand skid marks, it showed proof the woman tried to brake. ",
        "Ian: What about the Harris connection? ",
        "Garcia: Doesn't look like there is one. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I didn't think so. Saw the whole thing and the woman was pretty \r\nshaken up. ",
        "Garcia: Yeah, well, we had to check into it anyway, you know, just to make \r\nsure you and Dr. Lambert are protected from any further danger. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I appreciate that. ",
        "Garcia: How's she doing? ",
        "Ian: She's improving. ",
        "Garcia: We're still holding the woman who hit her for leaving the scene. ",
        "Ian: Why do you think she ran? ",
        "Garcia: We don't know yet. I'll need you to come down to the station to sign \r\na statement. ",
        "Ian: Later. ",
        "Garcia: Her arraignment's coming up and -- ",
        "Ian: Clouseau, I'm not going anywhere until I know that Eve's all right. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: So you're saying for someone to switch the DNA result, they have to \r\nhave access to the hospital's computer systems? ",
        "Victor: What I'm saying is that the DNA results had to have been switched by \r\nsomeone right here in the hospital. ",
        "Lucy: Why in the world are we even discussing this? It's done. I mean, the \r\nimportant thing is Eve and Ian are alive, they're ok. ",
        "Kevin: Because someone went to a lot of trouble to make us think they were \r\ndead. ",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, what's important is getting Eve better. You know, we haven't \r\nchecked on her in a while. Maybe -- maybe we'd better go do that. ",
        "Kevin: Soon, soon. I want to hear this first. ",
        "Lucy: Well -- ok, fine, but I still think it's just a complete waste of time.\r\n",
        "Victor: Lucy, the police have to follow up everything, not just what happened \r\nto Harris. ",
        "Kevin: Did they find out anything else? ",
        "Victor: About Harris? ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Victor: Well, they found his compound just as Ian described it. Signs of \r\nstruggle, blood. So far nobody's found a body. ",
        "Kevin: Do they even know if he's alive or not? ",
        "Victor: Well, it's beginning to look highly unlikely. But that doesn't mean \r\nthat Eve and Ian are necessarily out of danger. He had a substantial \r\norganization, and it's even been suggested that whoever altered the DNA results \r\nwas on his payroll. ",
        "Kevin: And working right here in the hospital? ",
        "Victor: No, no, no, not -- just someone with access to a hospital computer.\r\n",
        "Lucy: You don't know for sure that the DNA results were changed right here at \r\nthe hospital, right? ",
        "Victor: Yes, we do, Lucy. It turns out that the G.H. lab tech who ran the \r\ntests still had the original of what he'd entered into the computerized records. \r\nThose results were altered almost immediately after he input them, so it had to \r\nhave been done on a hospital computer. ",
        "Lucy: Well, the person could've made a mistake. I mean, people make big \r\nmistakes all the time. Look at the presidential thingy, you know, with the \r\npregnant chads and the dimpled chads and those buffalo -- butterfly -- ",
        "Kevin: Butterfly. ",
        "Lucy: Ballots, yeah. You know, that could've happened, a mistake. ",
        "Victor: Lucy, this was deliberate and it was done right under our noses. \r\nHospital personnel are being interviewed to see if anybody noticed anything \r\nsuspicious that day. Luckily, we've got a pretty good idea when it was done, so \r\nthat should make it very easy to check the tapes from the security cameras. ",
        "Kevin: Unthinkable, isn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it really is unthinkable. ",
        "Victor: Don't worry. We're going to find out who did this, and when we do, \r\nthat person is going to be looking at up to four years in prison. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, besides having to answer to me. I want them to know exactly what \r\nit feels like to be made to believe that your wife has died. ",
        "P.A. Announcer: Dr. Collins to ICU. Dr. Kevin Collins to ICU. ",
        "Kevin: That's Eve. I have to go. ",
        "Victor: I'll go with you. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Oh. Scott, hi. ",
        "Scott: Lucy. Eve and Ian are alive. Did you know that? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah. It's amazing, isn't it? ",
        "Scott: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I would've, but I didn't get a chance. It happened so fast and \r\nDoc was really very upset. ",
        "Scott: Well, is Eve ok? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, they think she's going to be fine. How did you hear about \r\nit? ",
        "Scott: The judge appointed me to represent the girl who hit her. ",
        "Lucy: You're not going to take that case, are you? ",
        "Scott: No, of course not. But I wanted to see Eve. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Did you happen to tell Serena yet? ",
        "Scott: No, not yet. I just wanted to make sure that Eve's ok. ",
        "Lucy: She's going to be really happy, don't you think? Serena's going to be \r\nthrilled to know Eve's alive. ",
        "Scott: Yeah. It's weird, though, you know, with these DNA results and \r\neverything. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, pal? It's really kind of funny and ironic that you should mention \r\nthat DNA stuff right at this very minute. ",
        "Scott: Why's that? ",
        "Lucy: Look -- I really, really could use your help right now. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Joseph. I want to see her. ",
        "Joe: No, you need to wait. ",
        "Ian: Wait for what? You know how I feel about her. I need to get in there.\r\n",
        "Joe: That's just it. You need to think real hard about what you want to do \r\nhere. ",
        "Ian: Eve and I love each other, and Kevin should know that. ",
        "Kevin: Is that why you paged me? ",
        "Joe: Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: I need to know what? Is something wrong with Eve? ",
        "Joe: No, no. There's nothing wrong. ",
        "Kevin: Then what were you just talking about? ",
        "Joe: Eve's awake. She's -- she's a little groggy, but she's talking, she's \r\nlucid. ",
        "Kevin: Why didn't you tell me sooner? ",
        "Joe: Dr. Kahn just finished examining her. I just wanted to make sure of the \r\nresults. ",
        "Kevin: Which are? ",
        "Joe: Well, it looks good. The headache's just an after-effect of the head \r\ntrauma. It's nothing permanent. ",
        "Kevin: Good. Do you mind if I see her? ",
        "Joe: Actually, she -- she asked to see both of you. ",
        "Kevin: Did she say why? ",
        "Joe: Hey. I just hope you know what you're doing. ",
        "Ian: She doesn't remember. \r\n\u00a0",
        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" -- ",
        "Jack: So tell me, Chris, how much is my vanishing act worth to you? ",
        "Chris: More money than you've ever seen, little brother. ",
        "Kevin: What kind of a person makes a man believe that his wife has died? ",
        "Lucy: I changed the DNA results on Eve and Ian. "
