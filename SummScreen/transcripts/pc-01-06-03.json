        "Tess: No! ",
        "Kevin: You did something to her, and \r\nnow she's gone! But you're the one who should be in her place, Tess. Not Livvie, \r\nyou! ",

        "Alison: Hi. Where have you been? I've \r\nbeen looking for you all night.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: I just -- I wanted to come \r\nto you after it happened, after you called off the wedding, but Stephen thought \r\nthat it would be better if you and Rafe had some time alone to talk. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, we did that. We \r\ntalked. ",
        "Elizabeth: Is everything all right? \r\nDid you work everything out? Is it ok? ",

        "Elizabeth: What do you mean? \r\n",
        "Alison: I don't even know how to begin \r\nto say this, so I'm just going to come out and just ask you, ok?\r\n\n",

        "Ian: Don't do this. Don't put yourself \r\nin danger like this. ",

        "Ian: No, it's not all right. I could \r\ndo worse than that.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: You won't, though. I know, Ian, \r\nyou won't. You're a strong man. You can -- you can fight this. You can. \r\n",
        "Ian: Fight it how? You don't know, do \r\nyou? ",
        "Lucy: What -- I know what Rafe said. I \r\nknow what we did before, when we destroyed Caleb. Everything went back to \r\nnormal. I know that -- ",
        "Ian: It's not Caleb. ",
        "Lucy: What? Oh, my God. Elizabeth bit \r\nyou? ",

        "Ian: There's nothing you can do.\r\n\n",

        "Ian: I'm not going to allow myself to \r\nhurt anybody, especially my boy. ",

        "Ian: Promise me you'll take care of my \r\nson. Promise me you'll take care of him. ",
        "Lucy: No. No. I'm not going to promise \r\nyou that, and you are not giving up. You hear me? Just give me a chance. I -- \r\nI'll think of something. Please. You're not giving up.",

        "Elizabeth: A vampire? No, he's saying \r\nthat I'm one now, too? Where on earth is this coming from? And what is this \r\nCaleb business? I thought that you agreed that Stephen is not Caleb. Caleb \r\ndoesn't even exist anymore. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. That's pretty \r\ncrazy. It's -- it's just that Rafe was mentioning -- ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Rafe. Ok. I should have \r\nknown. ",
        "Alison: No, it's more than that. It's \r\nnot what you're thinking. ",
        "Elizabeth: What, Alison? What is going \r\non? Tell me. ",
        "Alison: I think we need to sit down. \r\nOk?\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, ok. You're scaring me, \r\nbut come on, tell me. What -- what is it, sweetie? ",
        "Alison: Um -- I found something in \r\ndaddy's belongings. I found this picture. ",

        "Alison: Yeah, she is. ",
        "Elizabeth: Who is she? ",

        "Elizabeth: Well, is this what you were \r\ntalking about, though? Because I know that this is shocking. But, Alison, you \r\nknew. We both knew. ",
        "Alison: I didn't know everything.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: What? What do you mean?\r\n",

        "Elizabeth: What? ",
        "Alison: That woman is Rafe's mother. \r\nWhich means he's my brother. ",

        "Elizabeth: How does Rafe explain this?\r\n",
        "Alison: He doesn't. He just -- he \r\ngives me the same old story -- that it's Caleb, it's all his doing, and it's not \r\nreal. It doesn't --\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: No, wait, wait. Caleb, \r\nmeaning Stephen? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and that's when he told \r\nme that you are a vampire, too. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, God. ",
        "Alison: Mother -- ",
        "Elizabeth: This is so ridiculous.\r\n",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but he also said \r\nsomething about your drinking water, too, that that's part of it. ",
        "Elizabeth: What? The water now? \r\n",
        "Alison: He says that you drink it to \r\nmask the symptoms. ",
        "Elizabeth: That is the most ludicrous \r\nthing I've ever heard. Alison, I already told you that that is just some \r\nexpensive, vitamin-enriched drinking water. It -- and how could Stephen have \r\nanything to do with the situation with your father and Rafe? I mean, he \r\ncouldn't. That's just impossible. It -- Stephen is just a warm-hearted, loving, \r\ncaring man. He's just --\r\n\n",

        "Elizabeth: That's not important, \r\nsweetie. What's important is that you a hurting. I am so sorry about all of \r\nthis, well -- ok, wait. Let's -- maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Look at it \r\nthis way. Ok? Imagine if you had found out after you were married. No -- oh, \r\ngod. I didn't mean that to be so insensitive, sweetie. Oh, baby, I know your \r\nheart is breaking. God, I wish there was something that I could do to stop this \r\nhurt, but I know I can't. Just -- it's just going to take time. But, listen, \r\nyou're not going to have to go through this alone, ok? There are people who love \r\nyou and care about you, Alison. What I'm trying to say is I want you to move in \r\nhere.\r\nStephen \r\nand I can be your family now. ",

Stephen was just going to clean out the \r\nsolarium to make an office, but we can turn it into a room for you.
