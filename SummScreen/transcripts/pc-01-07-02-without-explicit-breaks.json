        "Alison: Wait -- gosh! ",
        "[Alison laughs] ",
        "rafe: That was great. ",
        "Alison: Even the falling-down part? ",
        "Rafe: Yes. Even the falling-down part. I just can't get over how amazing \r\neverything feels and smells. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Rafe: You know, it's like everything just smells so fresh. ",
        "Alison: Well, you obviously haven't been down to the subway yet. So what is \r\nthe next thing you want to experience? Hmm? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know. Call me boring, but just being here in the park today has \r\n-- it's been amazing. ",
        "Alison: Well, there must be something that you've always wanted to try or do, \r\nright? I mean, something that you wanted to do when you were alive? Please, tell \r\nme. Please, please, tell me -- tell me your little wish. Tell me your secret \r\nlittle wish, and I will do my very best to make it come true. ",
        "Eve: Victor, you're joking, right? ",
        "Karen: Yeah, you're not really saying there's some alien visitor among us.\r\n",
        "Victor: What i'm saying is that metallurgical tests show that this object, \r\nwhich was found where the light touched the ground, is not made of any element \r\nknown on earth. ",
        "Serena: That has to be what the light was. It's a spaceship. It came and \r\ndropped someone off, and then they lost their watch. ",
        "[Laughter] ",
        "lucy: Serena, you know what? You're too smart for your own good. Come here. \r\nYou need to go -- excuse me -- and get christina. ",
        "Serena: It's just getting good, though, mom. ",
        "Lucy: I will tell you everything later. You know i always do. Come on, you. \r\nCome on, sweet pea. Let's go get a snack. ",
        "Serena: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: I promise I will. Let's go. ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Victor: Well, serena's theory, except for the suggestion about intergalactic \r\ncar-pooling, seems perfectly plausibl ",
        "kevin: Victor, it's a bit of a leap, though, from unidentifiable -- ",
        "ian: It's a huge leap. ",
        "Eve: It's crazy, that's what it is. ",
        "Victor: All I'm saying is -- ",
        "lucy: Yoo-hoo. Hello. What are you guys doing? Do you really think we can \r\nafford to dismiss anything considering what we've all been through? ",
        "Paige: What are you talking about? ",
        "Kevin: That's a very long story. ",
        "Ian: No one's dismissing it. It'd just be nice to get some proof other than \r\n-- ",
        "karen: Yeah, I mean, for us to believe that there's some kind of pod person \r\nthat just landed in port charles -- ",
        "victor: Well, that's not the only thing that just landed in port charles. ",
        "Lucy: You can say that again, victor. ",
        "Jack: All right, we have no proof that this happened. Besides, you're scaring \r\nlivvie. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, jack, it's ok. I should have known some other kind of evil \r\nwould find us. ",
        "Jack: Hey. ",
        "Casey: Well, I don't need any more proof. I saw it with my own eyes. ",
        "Frank: Saw what? ",
        "Casey: The spacecraft. See, i didn't want to say anything because you'd think \r\ni was whacked, but that's the reason why i ran into helen keller over there. It \r\nwhizzed right over my head. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, great -- it is true. ",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, you know this girl is crazy, all right? ",
        "Kevin: Look, livvie, we don't know anything until we know something, ok? \r\nRelax. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: It's you, isn't it? ",
        "Paige: Me? What are you -- ",
        "lucy: Yeah, you know, I checked. You did not arrive on the plane, so i want \r\nto know -- where did you come from and why did you do it the way you did it \r\nbecause I'm not sure how you did it and where you came from in the first place, \r\nso tell me. ",
        "Paige: Are you actually asking me if i'm a space alien? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that's exactly what i'm asking you. ",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc., And soapnet] ",
        "rafe: I'm not trying to be secretive. I just -- I never did much daydreaming.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, come on. You didn't have, like, any little fantasies about, you \r\nknow, I don't know, about being a pirate or -- ",
        "rafe: Pirate, right. ",
        "Alison: Some sort of a baseball player? ",
        "Rafe: Look -- no, whoa, whoa. I never played sports, much less fantasized \r\nabout them. ",
        "Alison: Oh, I see. Well, mr. Grounded-in-reality, I mean, you must have done \r\nsomething, you know, before you died and became an angel. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well -- yeah, I trained for the job that i was called to do. ",
        "Alison: Right -- vampire slayer. ",
        "Rafe: Well, slaying all evil forces. See, i knew from the beginning that was \r\nmy destiny, so everything I did was geared towards being the best. ",
        "Alison: Right, right, right, but, I mean, you still had to do something fun.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Well -- yeah, you know, sometimes I did my training exercises \r\nblindfolded, you know, just for kicks. ",
        "Alison: Oh, you don't say. Oh, get out of here. ",
        "Rafe: Look, I -- people's lives depended on my skills. ",
        "Alison: Yes. ",
        "Rafe: So i took it very seriously. I considered it an honor. ",
        "Alison: It was an honor. I'm sure you were the -- you are the best at it. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you know, you're right, though, because all of this -- this has \r\njust been amazing, and being here with you, and i never realized how much I \r\nmissed out on till now. ",
        "Alison: Well, we're just going to have to make up for that, then. Especially \r\nnow since you don't really have to be fighting any evil mess. You know what I \r\nmean? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, which is a good thing since i don't have my powers. ",
        "Alison: And that's ok because you don't need any powers, ok? So for the first \r\ntime in your life, or your afterlife -- ",
        "rafe: Right, right. ",
        "Alison: You just need to relax and have some fun, ok? ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Alison: Isn't that what the big guy sent you down for -- fun? ",
        "Rafe: All right, fun. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: Fun. ",
        "Alison: Fun. ",
        "Rafe: Fun. ",
        "Lucy: All right, listen, paige -- if that's even your real name -- I want to \r\nknow where you came from. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, everyone, please. Let's just try and be rational about this, all \r\nright? ",
        "Livvie: Dad, how can we? Who knows what's out there after us? ",
        "Kevin: Because we don't know for sure that anything's after us. But I do know \r\nthat panic isn't going to help. ",
        "Paige: I think you should listen to your husband. ",
        "Lucy: I'm not finished with you yet. Excuse me. Livvie, your dad's right. \r\nPanic's not going to help anything. Come on. If -- big \"if\" -- if there are \r\naliens around here, then how do we know they'd do us any harm, anyway? What if \r\nthe aliens are so cute like e.T.? I love e.T. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, lucy, but what if it's not like e.T.? ",
        "Lucy: I see what you're saying. Fine, if it's not, then we handle it because \r\nyou know what we handled last time. Us port charlesers are very strong and can \r\nhandle just about anything, right? ",
        "Kevin: Right, that's right. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Hmm. ",
        "Casey: You better be because E.T. Is a fantasy. ",
        "Lucy: E.T. Is real. ",
        "Casey: Now that movie \"alien,\" that's probably what it's more like. You know, \r\nthose creatures exploding out of people's stomachs -- ",
        "jack: Hey, casey, all right, that's enough. ",
        "Casey: Oh, what's wrong? Wittle wivvie is scared of the boogie man? ",
        "Jack: I said that's enough, all right? ",
        "Livvie: No, no, jack, what if she's right? What if they do mean us harm? You \r\nknow, it wouldn't be the first time something's come after us. ",
        "Amy: Livvie, I don't really know what's going on, but it is true what they \r\nsay about the blind -- heightened senses and all that. And the one thing that i \r\ncan tell you is I don't feel any danger. And I don't believe there are any \r\naliens here. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, there was a time when i wouldn't have believed it, either, but \r\nyou don't know what we've lived through, what we've seen. ",
        "Amy: No, but it's pretty clear it left you with a great deal of fear. But it \r\nshould also give you courage knowing that you survived, knowing that you can \r\nbeat anything. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. We can, and we did, didn't we? ",
        "Kevin: Just who exactly are you? ",
        "Lucy: Looking for somebody? ",
        "Paige: No, I was just -- ",
        "lucy: I'm not going away, paige. I want you to tell me the truth. Who are you \r\nand where did you come from? Tell me now. ",
        "Paige: I told you, my flight got rerouted. ",
        "Lucy: Are you daft? I told youhecked there was no plane that landed from \r\ntoronto, so you lied. Why don't you tell me where you really came from and how \r\nyou got here? ",
        "Paige: Via spacecraft. ",
        "Lucy: Look, you, i know there is something off about you. Maybe you're not \r\neven the real paige. Maybe you're just inhabiting paige's body -- the body of \r\nthe person that went to school with my doc. ",
        "Paige: For pete's sake, lucy, I'm not a space alien. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. Then how do you explain the ageless alien skin, huh? ",
        "Paige: It's called good genes and staying out of the sun -- not hard to do in \r\nengland. ",
        "Lucy: Are you being flip with me? Fine. You know what I'm going to do? I am \r\njust going to go tell everybody that you're a liar. ",
        "Paige: No, ok. You got me. I'm from planet nitar. Third star from your sun.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Now I'm really mad. I'm going to scream it. Doc, everybody -- ",
        "paige: Please -- wait -- ",
        "lucy: I have something -- paige wants to -- ",
        "paige: Please, please, please. ",
        "Lucy: All right, I'm listening. ",
        "Paige: All right. I lied about how i got here and why I showed up on kevin's \r\ndoorstep. It wasn't just a whim. ",
        "Lucy: Big surprise. ",
        "Paige: The truth is i came to port charles to find kevin. I need him. ",
        "rafe: And what about you? What do you dream about? ",
        "Alison: Oh, well, see, now i -- I was a very materialistic kind of girl. ",
        "Rafe: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: See, i thought that i was going to die if I didn't get a beemer. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. ",
        "Alison: Hey, you. ",
        "Rafe: What about now? ",
        "Alison: Well, now my dreams are really simple. See, all i want to do is build \r\na life with jamal. I want to have a family. I want to have a home. And I want to \r\ntravel, and I just want to grow old together. ",
        "Rafe: Well, then -- oh, that's lucky, then, because you pretty much got that \r\nin the bag. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'm not so sure now. ",
        "Rafe: No, you know what? I'm telling you, this stuff going on with jamal, \r\nit's temporary, so it'll be ok. ",
        "Alison: I don't know. See, jamal and i, we used to be like this really great \r\nteam. You know, I mean, we could handle, like, anything that came our way. We \r\nwould handle it together, and now I just -- you know, I'm sorry. I'm not going \r\nto do this. Look -- let's don'T. The point is -- I'm just feeling, like, really \r\nselfish, you know, because I need to share him now, and I don't -- ",
        "rafe: Hey, hey -- hey? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: I have never known anyone less selfish than you. ",
        "Alison: Have i told you how nice it is to have you back? ",
        "Rafe: Have i told you how great it is to be back? ",
        "Alison: Well, and there's something else that I'm grateful for. ",
        "Rafe: What's that? ",
        "Alison: I'm just grateful that everything's getting back to normal. All this \r\nevilness is behind us. ",
        "Lucy: You know, I'm beginning to feel you really are daft. I don't know if \r\nyou've noticed, but kevin is truly unavailable. ",
        "Paige: No, no, no, you don't understand. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, why don't you make me understand? Shall we bond? Sit, sit, please. \r\nGo ahead. ",
        "Paige: Lucy, everything i told you two was a lie. Well, not everything. My \r\nhusband did die a while ago, and afterward, i didn't know where to turn. I \r\ndidn't know what to do, so i decided to go home -- to my family's home in \r\nengland. Thought at least i'd find some comfort there. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, but, alas, you didn't. ",
        "Paige: At first i wasn't really sure why. God, it's such a beautiful old \r\nplace, extraordinary just in its history, most of which hangs on the walls. \r\nThese grand, spectacular portraits of all my illustrious ancestors. Generation \r\nafter generation of past smiths, dating back to centuries. ",
        "Lucy: Ah, that's so lovely. And the point of any of this is? ",
        "Paige: The point is that i realized i've contributed nothing to that history. \r\nYou know, my husband's gone. I don't have children. I'm essentially alone in the \r\nworld, which made me think of kevin and how close we once were. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, go on. ",
        "Paige: I remembered how well he knew me, understood me, like -- well, like no \r\none I've ever known. And that's when I realized that he's the only one who can \r\nhelp me -- help me leave my legacy to the world, a testimony to who i am and who \r\ni've loved for future generations. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh. You want kevin to make you pregnant? ",
        "Paige: No, lucy. What i want is for kevin to paint me. ",
        "Eve: This really does feel strange. And why is there only one hand on this \r\nwatch? ",
        "Victor: You might as well ask me what is the sound of one hand ticking. I \r\ncan't even open the thing up. It's impregnable. ",
        "Karen: Maybe it's not even a watch. ",
        "Victor: Well, that's what I'm beginning to think, especially since that one \r\nhand hasn't budged since frank and I found it. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, seems like we have a real mystery on our hands. ",
        "Karen: I still think there's a more earthly explanation. ",
        "Eve: I think that i don't want to talk about this anymore. I'm going to go \r\ncheck on danny. ",
        "Casey: Ooh, space man's freaky timepiece. Can I see it? ",
        "Frank: Haven't we tried that already? ",
        "Casey: Excuse me? ",
        "Frank: And what's up with scaring livvie like that? What's your problem? ",
        "Casey: Oh, lighten up, will you? She's a drama queen. She loved it. ",
        "Karen: You know, maybe you shouldn't judge people you don't know. Livvie's \r\nbeen through a lot. ",
        "Casey: Yeah? So has everyone else. Get over it already. Hey, victor, those \r\nkids in the back are looking for you. ",
        "Victor: I beg your pardon. What were you doing in the back? ",
        "Casey: Looking for martians. Ooh. ",
        "[Casey laughs] ",
        "karen: Huh. Charming girl. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, she is a case, all right, but you know what? She really does \r\nremind me of lark when i first took her in. ",
        "Jack: Ahem. I need to talk with you. ",
        "Casey: So i knew you'd come around. ",
        "Jack: Look, I'm only going to say this one time. I don't care what kind of \r\ngames you play, but don't mess with livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, jack, honey, you don't have to protect me. I can hale her. ",
        "Casey: Oh, you know what? You two are so bad energy. ",
        "Livvie: We are? ",
        "Casey: All I want to do is have a good time, right? I'm on the road just \r\ndoing my thing, looking for a few fun and cool people to roll with, and you know \r\nwhat? You're not going to stop me. I'm blowing this joke of a town. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Livvie: Bye. ",
        "That's the best thing that's happened to us all day long, right? ",
        "Jack: Let's get a drink. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I should have guessed you were a pro by the way you handled my \r\ndaughter. ",
        "Ian: Where did you study? ",
        "Amy: I got my ph.D. In psychology at berkeley. ",
        "Kevin: Berkeley? ",
        "Amy: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Kevin: Maybe you know a friend of mine -- charles porter? ",
        "Amy: Oh, I know him well. He was on my thesis committee. What a coincidence.\r\n",
        "Kevin: My wife would say there are no coincidences. ",
        "Amy: Well, I feel very fortunate to have found my way to such good people. \r\nInteresting people. I mean, honestly, I've never met a more dynamic group. \r\nAlthough, I don't know what to make of the alien talk. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, speaking of that, I'm going to have another look at that watch.\r\n",
        "Amy: So, why don't you guys like each other? ",
        "Kevin: Something we said? ",
        "Amy: It's more like something you didn't say. I mean, you both spoke to me, \r\nbut you didn't say a word to each other. ",
        "Kevin: I can see I'm going to have to watch myself around you. ",
        "[Tires skid] ",
        "[crash] ",
        "Casey: God. ",
        "Ian: Stay down. ",
        "Casey: I'm fine. ",
        "Ian: Stay down. ",
        "Eve: Hey, hey, hey, lie still until we check you out. ",
        "Casey: I just said I'm fine. God, why can't you ever believe me? ",
        "Jack: Well, a better question is, why couldn't you drive that bike? Is it not \r\nyours? ",
        "Casey: Of course it's mine. I just haven't been driving it that long. Now, if \r\ny'all just get out of my way -- ",
        "frank: Wait, hey, hey, hold on. Where do you think you're going? ",
        "Casey: Anywhere but here. ",
        "Frank: Not until you pay for the damage you did to the restaurant. ",
        "Casey: Man, i've got 20 bucks to my name. Send me a bill. ",
        "Frank: Hey, well, you know what? That is not going to fly. You're just going \r\nto have to work it off until we're square. ",
        "Casey: Oh, what, work here in this crumb hall? ",
        "Frank: And I'm going to keep ahold of your bike in case you get any ideas \r\nabout bailing. ",
        "Casey: You're going to hold me prisoner, huh? Ok, so where exactly am i \r\nsupposed to stay? ",
        "Jack: Oh, no -- no, don't look at us. ",
        "Livvie: No, you've already had one free ride. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Frank: You know -- all right, I guess you can stay at my place. ",
        "Casey: Aren't i a little too young for you? ",
        "Karen: I think he means the guest apartment. ",
        "Casey: Fine! Make me your slave. But you know what? As soon as my debt's \r\npaid, I'm ghost. ",
        "Frank: I'm sure we'll both be counting the days. ",
        "Casey: Of all the places to get stuck in -- port charles. ",
        "Alison: I can't believe that you've never snowboarded. ",
        "Rafe: Well, like i said, I didn't get out much. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, don't worry because I will teach you everything. We've just \r\ngot to go grab the board from the apartment, ok? ",
        "Rafe: Oh, you know what? I'm not worried. I am ready for anything! ",
        "Alison: Ok, then -- then i'll race you. ",
        "Rafe: Hey, whoa, no head start! ",
        "Alison: No, no! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! ",
        "Rafe: Are you ok? ",
        "Alison: Ow. Yes, i -- ",
        "rafe: Whoa! No, no, no, no. ",
        "Alison: Oh! Don't! You're always doing this to me. Now don't drop me. Please, \r\ndon'T. ",
        "Alison: Jamal. ",
        "Paige: God, i had no idea this town was so exciting. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, it definitely has its moments. ",
        "Paige: Lucy, could I ask you to do something for me? ",
        "Lucy: Um -- ok what? ",
        "Paige: Could you not say anything to kevin about me wanting him to paint my \r\nportrait? ",
        "Lucy: Why would I do that after you've come all this way for that reason? ",

If i didn't have my doc and my two little girls, you know, I don't know -- \r\nwell, that's a whole other story. Listen, I admire you for wanting to leave \r\nsomething behind.
