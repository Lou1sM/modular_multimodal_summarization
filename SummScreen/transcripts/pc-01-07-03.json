        "Alison: Rafe! Stop it! What do you \r\nthink that you're doing? ",
        "Rafe: What do you think you're doing? \r\nYou're going over to Caleb's? He is dangerous, especially now. And as much as \r\nyou don't want to accept it, your mother is one of them now and she's dangerous, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Alison: Rafe -- ",
        "Rafe: Now, I know you don't believe \r\nme, but I swear to you it's true. And you know what? If I have to tie you up --\r\n",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Rafe: If I have to keep you prisoner \r\nhere, if -- what'd you just say? ",
        "Alison: I know. I know that my mother \r\nand Stephen are both vampires. I could tell it with her the second that I got \r\nthere. ",
        "Rafe: What? Then why didn't you leave?\r\n",
        "Alison: Because I have a plan. \r\n",

        "Ian: I got to go. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you better go. Listen to \r\nme. I want you to try and get some of that water -- Caleb's water -- and I'll do \r\nthe same thing. And you have to be careful, but you need to drink that as soon \r\nas possible, ok? ",

        "Kevin: It's about time. ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I think I fell \r\nasleep. You know, I came here looking for you. Are you all right? What -- what \r\nis it? What's wrong? ",

        "",
        "Jack: Damn it, Tess, where are you? \r\nCome on, come on. Ok, Jack, Jack, don't panic, don't panic. She probably -- she \r\nprobably went back to the house. What -- this is Tess' bracelet. And the clasp \r\nis broken. She was here. ",

        "Tess: Where am I? \r\n",
        "Caleb: You don't recognize it, Olivia?\r\n",
        "Tess: I told you, I'm not Olivia. I am \r\nTess. ",
        "Caleb: For now. But I know Olivia's \r\ninside you. And she needs to know she's finally home.",
        "",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. What do you mean, \r\nLivvie could be dead? What does that mean? Couldn't you be jumping to some sort \r\nof conclusion? ",
        "Kevin: Conclusions? Yeah, I could be. \r\nI suppose I could jump to a conclusion when the police show up with her wallet \r\nand tell me that they found it in the river by the docks! ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. ",
        "Kevin: After Jack and that -- that \r\ncreature that he lives with --\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: What are you talking about? What \r\n-- are you -- are you talking about Tess? ",
        "Kevin: Don't flatter that freak by \r\ngiving it a name. And she and Jack know something about Livvie, and they \r\nwouldn't tell me, so -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, Doc. So you finally met \r\nTess? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I met her. Never will \r\nagain, thank God. ",
        "Lucy: What? Kevin, what happened? Doc, \r\nwhere is Tess? What did you do to her? Doc, answer me. What happened to Tess?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I got rid of her. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: You really believe me? \r\n",
        "Alison: About my mother and Stephen \r\nbeing vampires, yes. But it still doesn't prove that you and I are not brother \r\nand sister.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: I'm right about all of it.\r\n",
        "Alison: Well, obviously I hope that \r\nyou are. But I have a plan. ",
        "Rafe: Right. What plan? ",
        "Alison: Ok, I started thinking about \r\nthings. You know, I was really upset, obviously about what we were talking about \r\nearlier, and I decided that I needed to go over to my mother's to see if what \r\nyou said about her was true. And I started thinking about it in the car, and \r\neverything is kind of making sense -- all of her strange behavior lately, her \r\nsudden marriage to Stephen, and those blue bottles -- that water -- which she \r\nwas actually guzzling tonight. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. \r\nBut what is this about a plan?\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Ok, well, then I started \r\nthinking about what you said about Stephen and how he probably set everything up \r\nto make it look like you and I were brother and sister, and I realized what I \r\nhad to do. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, I'm afraid to ask. \r\n",
        "Alison: I need to move in with Stephen \r\nand my mother. ",
        "Rafe: What? No, no. There's no way. \r\nThere's no way in hell. ",
        "Alison: Rafe -- ",
        "Rafe: I'm not letting you near that \r\nbeast -- ",
        "Alison: Stop it. Calm down. \r\n",
        "Rafe: Much less move in with him.\r\n",
        "Alison: Listen to me just for a \r\nsecond. It's the only way to find out if he really did set us up. I need to, \r\nlike, infiltrate their camp.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: \"Infiltrate their camp\"? What, \r\nare you watching spy movies now? ",
        "Alison: No -- I know, I know, I know \r\nthat sounds stupid, but it's the only way that I can kind of explain it. Rafe, \r\nit's the only way you and I are going to actually get the truth. ",
        "Rafe: Uh-uh. There's got to be another \r\nway. ",
        "Alison: No, there's not. There's not. \r\nThere's no D.N.A. test that we can do because my father's body was never found.\r\n",
        "Rafe: I don't care. You are not moving \r\nin with him! ",
        "Alison: I thought that you said you \r\nwanted to be together. ",
        "Rafe: I do. ",
        "Alison: Don't you see? It's the only \r\nway. We have to have proof that we're not related, and we can't be together till \r\nwe have it.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Please? Please? Just trust me, \r\nok? You asked me to trust you, and I did. Just let me get in there, let me find \r\nout what they're doing, and I will give you all the information. Don't you see? \r\nRafe, it is the only way. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah. It's the only way to \r\nget yourself killed. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Don't be afraid. Don't be \r\nafraid. This is what we both want. ",
        "Tess: What I want is to go home.\r\n",
        "Caleb: You are home. ",
        "Tess: You put this on me -- her dress.\r\n",
        "Caleb: I remember the day you first \r\nwore it. I remember the moment I first saw you in it. I was standing right over \r\nthere. You took my breath away.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: No. Stop saying that. \r\n",
        "Caleb: Why, Olivia? ",
        "Tess: Because I am not her. You put me \r\nin this dress and you can take me away, but I'm not her. I will never be her.\r\n",
        "Caleb: I can see you're nervous. You \r\nfeel her inside you, struggling to get out, and that makes you frightened.\r\n",
        "Tess: Please let me go. ",
        "Caleb: Just let it be, Tess. Don't \r\nfight it -- not here, not in this place. It's too powerful. It's where Livvie \r\nand I became one, where we were joined for eternity as husband and wife. So \r\nwhile you may not want to be here, Olivia does. She wants to come back to me. \r\nBut you don't need me to convince you of that. I'm sure Olivia herself will be \r\nmore persuasive.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Where are you going? ",
        "Caleb: To leave you alone with your \r\nmemories -- yours and Olivia's. Then we'll see how easy it is for you to keep \r\nher buried inside.",

        "Alison: Yes -- yes, Rafe. ",
        "[Rafe groans] ",
        "Alison: Listen to me. My mother will \r\nnot hurt me, and Caleb will go on thinking that I am still Stephen Clay's \r\nbiggest fan. ",
        "Rafe: That's ridiculous. Alison --\r\n",
        "Alison: This isn't open for \r\ndiscussion, I promise you. Think about it. What do I have to lose? ",
        "Rafe: Well -- I don't know. How about \r\nyour life, huh?\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Fine. That's fine. But I'm \r\nwilling to risk whatever it takes for us to be together. I mean, we are talking \r\nabout us. You risked your soul. So if we can't be together, then what was that \r\nfor? Nothing. I am going to do this, and it would really make me feel a lot \r\nbetter if you were in on it with me.",

        "Lucy: Doc, you really have me worried \r\nhere. Could you -- could you just try and explain to me what happened down here?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, it doesn't matter. It's \r\nnot as if Tess is real. Hell, I'm not sure what she is. ",
        "Lucy: She's a person. She's real. She \r\nhas feelings and emotions, and she happens to be very much connected to your \r\ndaughter, which means Tess is connected to you, too, you know. So come on, \r\nDoc, tell me. What happened? What went on down here? What happened to her?\r\n\n",
