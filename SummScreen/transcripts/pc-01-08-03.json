        "Ian: Give me that. ",
        "Elizabeth: I know that feeling, that \r\nhunger that just burns inside of you, that tears you to pieces so that you can't \r\nfeel anything else. I've been there. ",
        "Ian: You like to see me suffer, is \r\nthat it? That's how you get your kicks? ",
        "Elizabeth: This will take the pain \r\naway, and it's yours on one condition --\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Name it. ",
        "Elizabeth: You have to promise me not \r\nto come back here again. You just can't be showing up here being a reminder of \r\nour little indiscretion. ",
        "Ian: Give me the bottle! ",
        "Elizabeth: You're in no position to \r\nmake demands. Now, make that promise or get out. ",
        "Ian: Give me the bottle, or I can't \r\npromise what your bloodsucking husband's going to find when he comes here \r\ntonight! ",
        "",
        "Joshua: Please don't do that. I'm \r\nnervous enough. Why can't you just use the door? ",
        "Caleb: How could you let that slayer \r\nin here? How could you let him rough up the crew? ",
        "Joshua: He was not exactly invited. I \r\ntake it you ran into Rafe.\r\n\n",
        "Caleb: I found him. Let's just say it \r\nhas not been a great night. ",
        "Joshua: I'm listening. ",
        "Caleb: I went to the villa with Tess.\r\n",
        "Joshua: Tess? How could -- ",
        "Caleb: You sound surprised. \r\n",
        "Joshua: No, it's not -- I'm not -- I'm \r\nnot surprised. I thought Olivia was the one that you wanted. ",
        "Caleb: Something unforeseen has \r\nhappened to Olivia. Somehow she's locked inside Tess, and I couldn't get her \r\nback. ",
        "Joshua: Good. ",
        "Caleb: No. I am in no mood for one of \r\nyour lectures about how I should live my life. I will get her back. ",
        "Joshua: Fine. Take this. Save Olivia \r\nthe trouble -- slit your own throat.",

        "\n \r\nJack: Tess. Oh, my God, I was going out of my mind. ",
        "Tess: Just hold me, Jack, tight.\r\n",
        "Jack: I thought you were gone. \r\n",
        "Tess: I was, but I'm back now. See?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I don't understand. How? \r\n",
        "Jack: It's real easy. You obviously \r\ndidn't kill her, not that you didn't try . ",
        "\nLucy: Jack, please. That's enough for \r\nnow, ok? Tess, can you just tell us what happened? ",
        "Tess: Doesn't matter now. ",
        "Lucy: It does. It matters a lot to me. \r\nI need to know. Did you somehow fall in the water and then Kevin just leave you \r\nthere?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Kevin: I can -- ",
        "Tess: You don't have to say anything \r\nbecause I forgive you. ",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: It's better, isn't it?\r\n",
        "Ian: What's in this stuff? ",
        "Elizabeth: That's the mystery. Listen, \r\nI want you to take these with you, ok? You take these until I can figure out a \r\nway to get you some more, all right? But you've got to get out of here before \r\nStephen comes back. ",
        "Ian: Oh. You bite me and turn me into \r\nthis and then just push me out the door so I don't ruin your eveni?? Is that it? ",
        "Elizabeth: Listen, we'll -- we'll talk \r\nabout this some other time, ok? But he's going to be back here any minute. \r\nYou've got to go.\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Ah. This is wedding night. He \r\nhasn't shown up yet, which is how I got this little present in the first place.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: If you need me to say I'm \r\nsorry, believe me, I am. If there was any way that I could undo the fact that I \r\ndid this to you, I would. But I can't. ",
        "Ian: Why are you so nervous? You're \r\njumping out of your skin. ",
        "Elizabeth: Listen to me, Ian, please. \r\nYou've got to leave now. ",
        "Ian: You got to explain something to \r\nme. You say you have this sweet deal with endless love and all that. Why are you \r\nfrightened? ",
        "Elizabeth: God. Ok, I'm trying to \r\nprotect you, all right? ",
        "Ian: From what?\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: From him! If Stephen finds \r\nout that I turned you into a vampire, he's going to kill us both.",
        "",
        "Caleb: I don't want to hear another \r\nword about Olivia -- not a whisper. ",
        "Joshua: Fine. What do you want us to \r\ndo, pack up the circus? You want to put the Stephen Clay Experience out of \r\nbusiness? You tell me. You're the boss. ",
        "Caleb: We don't have to do anything. \r\nThe band goes on, so does Stephen Clay. ",
        "Joshua: How, Caleb? The slayers know \r\nyour true identity. ",
        "Caleb: Who cares? They can't hurt me. \r\nAnd every time they try to tell the world who I really am, they end up looking \r\nlike idiots. ",
        "Joshua: Do you mind telling me what it \r\nis that you want? You have everything. You have fame, you have power, you have \r\nmoney. You have a beautiful woman who's willing to crawl through fire for you.\r\n\n",
        "Caleb: Nothing matters except for \r\nOlivia. I've finally found my other half, my soul mate. ",
        "Joshua: If you had a soul. What if you \r\ncan't bring Olivia back? ",
        "Caleb: Even purity can be corrupted.\r\n",
        "Joshua: Even the strongest vampire can \r\nbe destroyed. ",
        "Caleb: Get the band in here. \r\n",
        "Joshua: They're licking each other's \r\nwounds. They're in no shape to play. ",
        "Caleb: I don't care how they feel! \r\nJust get them in here. ",
        "Caleb: See, Olivia? No one understands \r\nour passion. But the memories are seared on my heart, and I can't stop until I \r\nget you back. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: You forgive me?\r\n\n",
        "Tess: I can see the pain in you. \r\nThat's why. ",
        "Kevin: You killed my daughter and you \r\nforgive me? Well, I don't want your forgiveness or I don't want your little doe \r\neyes staring up at me, either. From now on, just stay away from me! ",
        "Jack: Don't come near her again.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No problem. Next time I'll \r\nleave it to the police. How's that? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, come on. You don't know \r\nwhat happened. You don't know for sure that Tess had something to do with \r\nLivvie's disappearance. You don't know that. ",
        "Kevin: I'm just following my \r\ninstincts, Lucy. Isn't that what you taught me to do? ",
        "Tess: He's not really mad at me. He's \r\nmad at himself because he feels he let Livvie down. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, you're a mind reader now?\r\n",
        "Tess: You don't have to be angry \r\nanymore. Livvie knows you love her, and she loves you, too. ",
        "Kevin: You know nothing about my \r\ndaughter. You're just a cheap imitation. ",
        "Jack: I said that's enough. \r\n",
        "Kevin: What good is your forgiveness \r\nanyway, when you're still walking and my daughter's dead? As far as I'm \r\nconcerned, the wrong person died. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, come on, you're just upset. \r\nYou don't mean that. ",
        "Kevin: I would trade Tess' life for \r\nLivvie's in a heartbeat. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jack: Come on. Let's go. ",
        "Tess: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jack: You stay away from her. \r\n",
        "Kevin: What are you staring at? \r\n",
        "Lucy: You. I see your face, you look \r\nlike my husband, you sound like him, you have all his facial expressions and his \r\ngestures. You're supposed to be the man that I've loved for so very long. But I \r\ndon't know you. Who are you? ",
        "Kevin: Ok, you think I was insensitive \r\nto Tess? Fine. I'll remember that the next time she kills someone I care about!\r\n",
        "Lucy: You are not sure that is what \r\nhappened. ",
        "Kevin: Give me another explanation, \r\nthen. ",
        "Lucy: You give me proof that that's \r\nwhat did happen other than your hatred. Do you understand what you did, Doc? \r\nYou're making one person's life more valuable than the other person. You're \r\nmaking them interchangeable somehow. ",
        "Kevin: She isn't even a person! She's \r\nnot real! ",
        "Lucy: She is real, and she's good and \r\nshe's fine. She's so good she just stood here and tried to comfort you while you \r\nwere tearing her apart. ",
        "Kevin: Don't you get it? I can't look \r\nat her face and not see the face of the girl I'll never see again. ",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, see what you did for \r\n-- for Livvie? You let Tess fall into the water and you -- you didn't even reach \r\nout a hand and try and help her back out. ",
        "Kevin: That was an accident, Lucy.\r\n",
        "Lucy: An accident? Don't you see? You \r\ndidn't help her. A rational person would've tried to get her out of the water.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Oh, ok. It all becomes clear. \r\nYou think I'm crazy. Amazing how it always comes back to that. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, I -- I think -- Doc, \r\ncome on. Maybe we just rushed your recovery a little too quickly. It's too soon. \r\nThat's all I'm trying to say. ",
        "Kevin: You think I'm off my rocker? I \r\ndon't care. I just lost my daughter. ",
        "Lucy: And I'm sorry, but I think you \r\nneed to go back to that hospital before you hurt somebody else. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I'm not afraid of your husband.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: Then you're a fool. He's \r\ndangerous. ",
        "Ian: So why are you with him? \r\n",
        "Elizabeth: It's complicated. He's \r\ncomplicated. ",
        "Ian: No, he's not complicated at all. \r\nHe's a bloodsucking vampire who thrives on people's fear. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, you know, you don't \r\nunderstand, ok? He -- he's been very good to me. He reached out to me when I was \r\nat my lowest. He -- ",
        "Ian: He took advantage of you. He \r\nturned you into whatever the hell you are now and left you to deal with it.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: No, no -- no, it was a \r\ngift. ",
        "Ian: A what? A gift? Look at you. Look \r\nwhere you are -- you're in this apartment, dark apartment drinking strange water \r\njust so you don't go out and hunt people down. That's not a gift. That's a \r\ncurse. I don't fancy being younger than my own son one day or outliving all the \r\npeople I care about. That's your gift. You can watch Alison grow into a fine \r\nyoung woman, have children, then she'll die, and then you can watch her children \r\ngrow up and die and their children grow up and die -- ",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, just stop it! All \r\nright, I know. I know that, I know you're right, but this isn't like some flu \r\nthat we caught. It's permanent. ",
        "Ian: We don't know that. Maybe there's \r\na way out, but I need your help. You're the only one who can get close to \r\nStephen. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no, no. I will not \r\nbetray him. No, he'll kill me. He's already told me that. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? Well, I'd rather die than \r\nlive like this. How about you? ",
        "",
        "Caleb: You two are a sorry pair.\r\n",
        "Reese: Bloody slayer took us by \r\nsurprise, boss. ",
        "Caleb: Well, that's what slayers do, \r\ndon't they? But good vampires are ready for them. ",
        "Cass: Give us a break, man. Dude was \r\ntaking no prisoners. ",
        "Ricky: Whoa. What happened here? You \r\nguys didn't party without me, did you? ",
        "Cass: Ow. ",
        "Reese: Yeah, this is one party you'll \r\nbe glad you missed. ",
        "Cass: Yeah, dude. It got seriously \r\ncrashed. ",
        "Ricky: Well, come on, man, let's crash \r\nback. Let's get these guys who did this to you. ",
        "Caleb: Shut up, Garza. Give me these.\r\n",
        "Joshua: Take it easy, Stephen. \r\n",
        "Caleb: No. You know what? If you ask \r\nme, I've been too easy on everybody so far. Have you forgotten who we are? We're \r\nthe Stephen Clay Experience. Let's start acting like it. Now, are we here to \r\nplay, or what? ",
        "Ricky: Let's do it. ",
        "Caleb: Ready? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, let's go. One, two, three \r\n-- ",
        "Caleb: Stop! Hey, if we're going to \r\nplay, let's play! Do it again. ",
        "Ricky: One, two, three -- ",
        "Caleb: Finish what you started, boy \r\nand don't leave 'em sleepin' I put out the call,...",

        "Jack: Are you hungry? Do you need \r\nanything? ",
        "Tess: Just you. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Look, I -- I know this is \r\ndifficult, but I -- I have to ask you about him, about Caleb. You were with him \r\ntonight, weren't you? ",
        "Tess: He -- he was the one who pulled \r\nme from the water, and then he took me to his beautiful home. ",
        "Jack: The villa? ",
        "Tess: What did you call it? \r\n",
        "Jack: Caleb's villa. I still have \r\nnightmares about that place. He -- he didn't hurt you, did he? ",
        "Tess: No. He wants Livvie and he's \r\nupset that I'm not her. He tried to find her but I wouldn't tell him. \r\n",
        "Jack: Well, you're here with me and \r\nyou're safe. And you're all mine. ",
        "Tess: Show me. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: You're still calling. I'm the \r\ndream you keep reliving, time's slipping and it's taking toll. I'm the gift that \r\nkeeps on giving, feel my fire burning in your soul,... ugh!",

        "Kevin: I'm not going back to that \r\nhospital, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I -- I just think that it would \r\nbe good for you. It's -- ",
        "Kevin: If it's so great, you go. I \r\nshould've expected this. ",
        "Lucy: Expected what? ",
        "Kevin: All your compassion. Come on, \r\nLucy. You wrote my daughter off a long time ago. ",
        "Lucy: No, I didn't. You know that \r\nwe've had our differences. I mean, Livvie and I don't see eye to eye on \r\neverything, but she is your daughter -- ",
        "Kevin: Oh, just admit it. You're glad \r\nshe's gone. ",
        "Lucy: How can you say that? Where are \r\nyou going with that? What does that mean? ",
        "Kevin: You think I wouldn't notice, \r\nLucy? All the times you came to me and said, \"Doc, Livvie's bad news\"? I'm \r\nsurprised you didn't try to ship her off to some institution the way you did \r\nwith me and the way you're trying to do again right now. ",
        "Lucy: That is so not fair. It's not -- \r\nLivvie did bad things. She hurt a lot of people. She did some horrible things. \r\nBut never, ever would I want her dead. And if you don't know that, then you \r\ndon't even know what kind of person I am at all. ",
        "Kevin: If you're going to dismiss my \r\nfeelings as the ramblings of a crazy man, just go. I'll mourn my daughter in \r\npeace, thank you very much. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, listen, how about this? How \r\nabout we do this together? How about we try and figure out what happened to \r\nLivvie together? No arguing, no pointing fingers, just try and work it out \r\ntogether? Talk to me, talk to me. Just turn around and let's talk about this. \r\nDoc? Ok, fine. Consider me gone. ",

        "Jack: Tess, I -- I wish it were that \r\nsimple. But you look just like the woman he loved, and he's not going to stop \r\ncoming after you. Not unless I stop him first.",

        "Ian: So you'd rather spend the rest of \r\neternity like this, hoping no one finds your secret? ",
        "Elizabeth: No, I would love to have my \r\nlife back. It wasn't a bed of roses, but at least it was my life. ",
        "Ian: Good. Then take it back. Do it \r\nfor Alison. Be a mother she can be proud of. ",
        "Elizabeth: Ok. You -- you've got to \r\ngo. I'm sorry. I'll try. No, no, no, no, you've got to go out the back door so \r\nnobody can see you. ",
