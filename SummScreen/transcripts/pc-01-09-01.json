        "Jamal: Look, I shouldn't be wasting my time on this thing. I need to be \r\nbusting that guy in his head that disrespected you. ",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal, somehow I really don't think that's going to make him \r\nany smarter, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well -- ",
        "Alison: You know, the guy was a drunk. You know? I mean, he thought that I \r\nwas a prostitute and you were my pimp. Who cares? ",
        "Jamal: What are you talking about who cares? I care, and you should, too. ",
        "Alison: Look, I know that you don't like being stereotyped because you're you \r\n-- ",
        "Jamal: What? Say it -- I'm black. I'm black. I know this. You can say the \r\nword. ",
        "Alison: Ok! ",
        "Jamal: Say it! ",
        "Alison: Jamal, the guy's bad attitude is his problem. ",
        "Jamal: As long as we're together, it is our problem. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Look, flowers or no flowers, you should have called me. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm sorry. My big brother decided I was a bad influence on \r\nyou, so he asked the desk clerk to block all my calls. I found out because I \r\nbribed the truth out of the doorman. ",
        "Livvie: Chris had no right to do that! ",
        "Jack: Hey, I know. But you know what? I don't want to talk about Chris, \r\nespecially when I have you right here in my arms. So what do you say we go out \r\nand celebrate? ",
        "Livvie: What's the occasion? ",
        "Jack: Second chances. I went back to Westford, cleared things up with my \r\nprobation officer. ",
        "Livvie: So you can stay here? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I can stay here in Port Charles. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, that's great! ",
        "Jack: Now, I have to get a job. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Well, I -- I -- gee, I thought you had already gotten a job since \r\nyou could afford all these flowers. Oh, you didn't do anything -- ",
        "Jack: Illegal? No. Those days are over. Actually, somebody paid me back a \r\nvery large debt that they owed me. And because of that -- ",
        "[Livvie screams] ",
        "Jack: I'm going to take you out in style. ",
        "Livvie: Oh -- oh! ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Well, you said you wanted to confess something. Come on, Lucy. What \r\ncould you have done that could be so terrible? ",
        "Waitress: Can I take your order? ",
        "Kevin: Uh, yeah. I think I'll just have a cup of herbal tea. ",
        "Waitress: Ok. ",
        "Waitress: Anything for you, hon? ",
        "Lucy: No. Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what's on your mind? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, we need to go somewhere more private and have this discussion. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, now you're starting to worry me. What is it? ",
        "",
        "Ian: It's not a dream. I'm here. Are you all right? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. I -- I -- I just remember a little bit of what we went \r\nthrough. ",
        "Ian: Then let me help you. I remember everything. ",
        "Eve: Kevin said it wasn't important that I remember. ",
        "Ian: It is important -- to you and me. ",
        "Eve: I remember part of Christmas Eve. Um -- I -- I thought we were trying to \r\nget home. But I don't know. It just seems like a dream. ",
        "Ian: No. It wasn't a dream. It was real, all of it, what we did and what we \r\nsaid. Please. I need you to remember. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Welcome to my side of the tracks, baby. The race thing is now \r\nofficially our problem. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, look, this could've happened no matter who I was with. All \r\nright? Think about it. It's late, we're outside of a bar, ok? You know, hot \r\nblonde, hey, you know, skimpy outfit -- ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Hands over some money to a guy on a bike. Ok? This says as much about \r\nme as it does about you. Actually, I'm sorry -- this says the most about the \r\nstupid drunk. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know the whole world's not racist. I know that, ok? But there \r\nsure are enough of them going around. Look, now, you know -- this is the first \r\ntime this has happened to you. Ok? You keep hanging with me, it won't be the \r\nlast. Dag! You don't get it! ",
        "Alison: Jamal -- I -- stop! You're going to ruin your bike, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I just want things to be fixed, ok? I just want to fix this \r\nbike, I want us to be fixed, I want everything to be fixed. That's it. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Alison: God. ",
        "[Jamal hammers] ",
        "Jack: Hey. ",
        "Livvie: Hey! ",
        "Jack: We got some good news. ",
        "Livvie: Jack's cleared up all of his probation troubles and wants to take us \r\nout to celebrate. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Thanks, but I don't think that we're in the mood to do any \r\ncelebrating. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Now you do trust me, don't you? ",
        "Eve: With my life, yeah. ",
        "Ian: I'm going to take this very slowly. I want to try and touch on some \r\nthings that happened between us, some things that we shared. And hopefully, \r\nit'll -- it'll spark a connection in your beautiful noggin. Do you remember \r\nbeing kidnapped? ",
        "Eve: Yes, I remember that. ",
        "Ian: Ok. I'll try to start with your last memory. I went to talk to Harris, \r\nand you were upset because I wouldn't let you come. ",
        "Eve: Sounds like me. ",
        "Ian: Do you remember that? ",
        "Eve: No. No, I don't. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Now, when I came back, I told you that Harris had said that he would \r\nlet us go soon, hmm? And your face lit up because you thought you were going to \r\nbe home for New Year's. But you thought that he had something up his sleeve. ",
        "Eve: Did he? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. But I told him that I was the only one that could treat him for \r\nthis disease and that I wouldn't if he didn't let you go. ",
        "Eve: Really? You did that for me? ",
        "Ian's Voice: I would've done anything for you. I told Harris about the cure \r\nand everything's a go. And you're also released from your obligation. ",
        "Eve: How did you manage to do that? ",
        "Ian: Well, I told him if he ever had a relapse, I'm the only one that can \r\nhelp him. And I wouldn't if he touched you. ",
        "Ian: What is it? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I guess I should just zip my lips and retreat to my corner, you know, \r\nbut I -- I know you're my best friend and I -- I want to feel like I can tell \r\nyou anything. ",
        "Kevin: Sit down. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Kevin: You can tell me anything and you know that. That's one of the \r\nthings I've always loved about you, Lucy. You -- you've never been afraid to put \r\nyour feelings on the line and, let's face it, you have a way of slicing right \r\nthrough to the heart of the matter. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I don't think I have to say this, but I want to. I -- I would \r\nnever, ever hurt you. You know that. I wouldn't. ",
        "Kevin: I know. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I -- I wouldn't. But what I did to you and Eve is really unfair.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No. What's unfair, Lucy, was my using you as a sounding board for my \r\nfeelings for Eve, especially given how close we've been. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, you don't have to do that anymore. You don't have to, you know, \r\nskirt around and around what you mean. What you mean is -- oh -- we made love. \r\nAnd we found each other again. And then you found your wife on the doorstep. End \r\nof story. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you've been my rock. When I thought Eve died, I fell apart, and \r\nno one could get through to me except you. And that's because I feel safe with \r\nyou. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you were in so much pain and what else could I really do? ",
        "Kevin: You just keep amazing me, Lucy. I don't know why, but you always seem \r\nto know just what to do when I need it the most. ",
        "Lucy: It's easy, it is. It's the easiest thing in the world for me to do that \r\nwith you because I know you, Doc. I know you better than anybody in the whole \r\nworld. And I would do anything to make your life better, to make you happy at \r\nall costs because I love you. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Uh, sorry, you guys, but Jamal here is more bent out of shape than \r\nhis bike. ",
        "Livvie: What, are you guys in a fight or something? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, or something. ",
        "Jack: Well, why don't you let me take a look at it? I'm pretty good with a \r\nwrench. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, Jamal is, too, when he's not in a funk. Hmm. Why don't we go \r\nfix the guys something to eat? ",
        "Livvie: All right. ",
        "Jack: Pretty nice bike. I used to have a bike just like this. The mechanic \r\nshop where I used to work cut me a deal on a used one. ",
        "Jamal: That's nice. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Could've swung it otherwise, but it's just -- hey. You might need \r\nthis right here. Yeah, I wish I still had mine. ",
        "Jamal: What, you sold it or something? ",
        "Jack: No, bills. You know, my mom was sick. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know that story. ",
        "Jack: So, how'd this thing get banged up anyway, man? ",
        "Jamal: Some drunk saw Ali and me in the alley and thought we made the perfect \r\ncouple. ",
        "Jack: And there's something wrong with that? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, a pimp and a hooker to be exact. ",
        "Jack: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: So I let him have it and he kind of took it out on my bike a little \r\nbit. ",
        "Jack: Hey, man, there's morons everywhere, from that drunk who hit your bike \r\nto my doctor brother. And it's amazing that they get a kick out of looking down \r\non us. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, like it's their world alone and the rest of us are just some \r\njunk messing up the scenery. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but you know what? I got a new perspective now thanks to Livvie. \r\nI'm not going to let them get to me anymore. In fact, to hell with them. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Try to remember, Eve. ",
        "Eve: It's just -- it's all jumbled. ",
        "Ian: Just try to remember and I will help you. ",
        "Eve: I'm trying. I'm so confused! ",
        "Ian: You're so close. You're so close to remembering. ",
        "Gail: Dr. Thornhart? Could I just see you a minute? ",
        "Ian: Hi. ",
        "Gail: Hi. I don't think that being reminded of the ordeal she's been through \r\nis what's really best for Eve right now and you'd want to do what's best for \r\nher, don't you? ",
        "Ian: She knows I do. ",
        "Gail: Well, then, please. ",
        "Ian: I'm going. Hey. If you need me, I'm here, ok? ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Gail: Well, hi, stranger. How are you doing? ",
        "Eve: Hi, Gail. I'm glad to be home. ",
        "Gail: Ah. I'm so sorry, Eve, that -- that all this happened to you. ",
        "Eve: Well, it's not so bad, seeing as I can't remember most of it. ",
        "Gail: Oh, sweetheart, you've been through a tremendous ordeal. And, well, I \r\nmean not just the kidnapping, but the accident and -- just have a little faith, \r\nEve. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "Gail: Clarity will come in time. ",
        "Eve: How can I have faith when I don't even trust what's going on in my own \r\nmind? The places that it's going. I'm -- I'm scared, Gail. I'm scared to death.\r\n",
        "",
        "Kevin: Oh. Our timing stinks, Lucy. Eve is my wife. She needs me. ",
        "Lucy: I know that. Eve was hit by a car. I just feel like I was. ",
        "Kevin: I hate this, Lucy. I want to be able to help you. I want to be \r\nthere for you the way you've always been there for me. ",
        "Lucy: I know. But you can't do both right now, and Eve is the one with that \r\ngold ring. Doc, look, I am -- I am so happy. You make me so happy that you think \r\nI'm wonderful and that I'm noble. So I am just going to quit right now while I'm \r\nahead. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute, not so fast. You told me you had something important to \r\ntell me. ",
        "Scott's Voice: Tell Kevin you changed the DNA results and throw yourself on \r\nhis mercy. Throw yourself on his mercy. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I know that look on your face. You're keeping something from me.\r\n",
        "",
        "Livvie: It's not Thanksgiving anymore. Cut back on the turkey because Jack is \r\ngoing to take us out to celebrate the good news. Come on. ",
        "Alison: Well, can he afford all that? Like what'd he do, like rob a bank? ",
        "Livvie: Jack happened to collect big on a debt that someone owed him. ",
        "Alison: Well, who would owe him money like that, you know? And how come he \r\ndidn't do it before? I mean, he came to town broke, didn't he? ",
        "Livvie: God, I'm just so sick of people like you and Chris dissing Jack all \r\nthe time. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, don't go postal on me, all right? I'm just asking a \r\nquestion. ",
        "Livvie: No. Come on, Jack is, like, the most amazing guy I have ever met. No \r\none knows him like I do. ",
        "Alison: All right. I was just looking out for a friend, ok? I promise I will \r\nbutt out and zip my lips. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I just don't understand why everybody can't see what an amazing \r\nguy Jack is. ",
        "Alison: Girl talk. Huh. ",
        "Livvie: Are you ok? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm more than ok. No one's ever stuck up for me like that. ",
        "Livvie: Well, get used to it because I happen to think you are a wonderful \r\nperson. I just tell it like it is. ",
        "Garcia: Jack Ramsey? ",
        "Jack: Who wants to know? ",
        "Garcia: Detective Garcia, PCPD. You're under arrest. ",
        "",
        "Eve: It's just all mixed up. You know? These thoughts and images keep \r\nfloating through my mind. I had a dream about Ian and me and -- and just now \r\nwhen he was sitting here, it was like parts of that dream flashed through my -- \r\nmy memory, but only this time, I was awake and I don't know. I just -- I feel \r\nlike I'm losing it. ",
        "Gail: Look, Eve, maybe if you can tell me about this dream or memory or \r\nwhatever it is, then you and I can sort it out together. ",
        "Eve: I -- I had a romantic dream about Ian. Why would I be fantasizing about \r\nIan? ",
        "Gail: Well, he's a very attractive man. He saved your life. He acted very \r\nheroically. It's only natural that you might idealize your rescuer, but, Eve, \r\nwhat's really important is to focus on what you know is real, like being home \r\nand like being a happily married woman to a husband who's devoted to you and \r\nwould do anything in the world for you. ",
        "Eve: Now, that I do remember. I'm really lucky to have him. ",
        "Gail: And he'll take care of you. You just let him, and then the healing can \r\nbegin. ",
        "Eve: You're right, Gail. You are so right. Thank you. ",
        "Gail: I'll come back and check on you later, ok? And just don't think about \r\nanything right now except getting well, ok? ",
        "Eve: I'll try. ",
        "Gail: I'll see you. ",
        "Ian: Gail. ",
        "Gail: Oh, Ian. Look, I don't know exactly what happened while you and Eve \r\nwere away, but I can't stress enough how important it is that you give her some \r\ntime and some space so that she can heal. ",
        "Ian: No one wants Eve well more than I do. ",
        "Gail: Well, if you truly care about her, then you'll back off. And you'll let \r\nEve discover the things she needs to know by herself. ",
        "Ian: I -- ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you don't have to stall. You obviously need to tell me about \r\nsomething you did. ",
        "Lucy: Well, and you need to know about me. You know, I -- you know me. I -- \r\nbig important thing. I make a big deal out of it, but it's not really that \r\nimportant, so, Doc, you need to go back to your wife. ",
        "Kevin: I can tell when you're hiding something. ",
        "Lucy: A little repression's always good for the soul. I've heard that, I \r\nthink, from you. Ta, Doc. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Pardon me! ",
        "Man: What the heck are you doing, lady? ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I'm running into you. No, that's not what I'm doing. I'm \r\nrunning. I'm running. That's what I always do. See, that's my thing. That's my \r\nM.O. I always run. I always run away. Well, you know what? I've got to stop this \r\ncycle. I've got to break that right now and I'm going to. I'm going to -- I'm \r\ngoing to do it, thanks to you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Doc? Listen, you \r\nknow what I just did? I almost did the most cowardly thing in the world, and \r\nthat's not like me. I, Lucy Coe -- I am not a coward. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you don't have to tell me that. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I sort of do because you turned my head here. You were saying all \r\nthose really nice things, and you spun me around about 46 times. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I meant every word of it. ",
        "Lucy: Do you know how long I have waited for you to say those things, for me \r\nto hear those things come out of your mouth? So I think what I wanted to do was \r\njust hold on to that moment. And that's why I ran away -- because I didn't want \r\nto tell you anything that might make you think badly of me. ",
        "Kevin: I never could. You know that. ",
        "Lucy: I think I'm beginning to believe that. I think I'm starting to believe \r\nthat maybe you accept me for all my wacky ways and that's going to give me the \r\ncourage to tell you the truth because you know as much as you love anchovies, \r\neverything I do comes out of me loving you. ",
        "Kevin: We're coming to the terrible thing you did, aren't we? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. What I did, I did to protect you. I did something -- I kept \r\nsomething from you because I thought if you found out, you would be devastated, \r\nand I sort of messed up, so I'm hoping you can forgive me. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, forgive you for what? ",
        "Lucy: What I did, Doc, is going to set my karma back a few lifetimes. See, I \r\n-- I knew the truth and I pretended I didn't. ",
        "Kevin: What truth? ",
        "Lucy: I knew Eve and Ian were alive. \r\n\u00a0",

        "Jack: I swore to myself I would never let you ruin my life again. ",
