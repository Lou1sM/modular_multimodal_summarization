", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Yeah, victor's torn the whole place apart looking for it. ", "Karen: You know, maybe that pod person that crashed here in that weird light just beamed it up. ", "Frank: Yeah, you might not be laughing if we're all flying around in space ships. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Karen: Hmm. ", "Eve: Karen! I have patients lined up a mile long out there, I got requisition forms that won't fill out themselves, and the nurses' union is breathing down my neck, and you're in here fooling around with frank? ", "Karen: You know what? I just finished a 14-hour shift, but, hey, I'm game for more if you need me. ", "Eve: I'm sorry. I'm -- i'm really stressed out. ", "Karen: Yeah, been there. ", "Eve: Yeah.

", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Like all married couples, we had our problems, but we're working them out. Thanks for asking. ", "Amy: Ok. ", "Ian: You don't sound convinced. ", "Amy: No, I probably sound embarrassed because it's none of my business. I mean, it's not as though i've had any real relationships to judge anybody else's by. ", "Ian: I find that hard to believe. ", "Amy: Well, believe it. I drove away the only man I ever loved. ", "Ian: What happened? ", "Amy: We met in college. He was poor, on a scholarship. My parents were against it from the start. They said he was only after my money, which translates to, \"how could a handsome boy like that want a poor, defenseless blind girl like you?\" ", "Ian: And you listened to them. ", "Amy: Well, you hear something often enough, it starts to sound like the truth. It wasn't until after he left that i realized he wasn't after my money at all, only me. ", "Ian: I'm sorry. ", "Amy: Don't be. I blew it. I didn't have faith in him, so i lost him. But I vowed if it ever happened again, this time i would listen to my heart and to hell with what anyone else said or thought. ", "Ian: I think I know exactly what you mean. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Ramsey, why didn't you show up? ", "Chris: Did we have an appointment? ", "Eve: Yes.

", "Eve: Party's over, ramsey. Time to sober up. ", "Chris: If this is your idea of an intervention -- thank you -- i'm not interested. ", "Eve: So what are you going to do, just sit here and drink yourself to death?", "Chris: Yeah, sure. You got a better idea? ", "Eve: Yeah, I do, but you've got to clean up your act first. ", "Chris: Eve, thanks for caring, really, but I've been giving my future some serious consideration and I've narrowed it down to a few choices. I'm either going to become a kept man or eurotrash, but I think you have to be european for that. ", "Eve: Uh-huh. ", "Chris: I've also considered the challenging field of food service. Here, check this out. \"Yes, ma'am, would you like fries with that?\" ", "Eve: Damn it, ramsey! You jackass, i'm trying to offer you a job. ", "Chris: Didn't you get the memo? I was fired. ", "Eve: I know that, but I can fix things with alan quartermaine, but I need your help. Ramsey, we need you. Hey -- I need you. ", "Chris: You want me to work for you? ", "Eve: Well, hell, I'm a lot nicer than the last chief resident. ", "Chris: Thanks, but no thanks. ", "Eve: Ramsey, please, I want to succeed at this job, and I don't believe that you just want to throw your career down the drain. You are a brilliant doctor, and it's a part of who you are. ", "Chris: And what has it gotten me? Happiness, fulfillment? A time share in the bahamas? I have plenty of money. I can travel, I can do anything i want, go anywhere I want. ", "Eve: Then why the hell are you sitting on a barstool in the middle of the day feeling sorry for yourself? ", "Chris: Because if i don't do it, who else will? ", "Eve: Melancholy drunks are a real turnoff. Ramsey, I'm going to get up now and walk across that street, and I want you to come with me. ", "Chris: Don't let the door hit you on the butt on your way out. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Amy: When i lost my sight in my teens, i was devastated. I thought my life was over. But then gradually my other senses kicked in and i found that i could tell what people were feeling without them ever speaking. ", "Ian: Really? ", "Amy: Well, for instance, you feel intrigued, with a healthy dose of skepticism. You're wondering if i'm for real. ", "Ian: That's close enough, yeah. ", "Amy: Believe it or not, being blind has its advantages. It taught me to understand the sense of touch in a totally new way. When i touch someone's face, I can read their whole history. Do you mind? ", "Ian: It's not a very interesting read. ", "Amy: I can see that you've seen some horrible things. But you haven't lost your ability to smile or to see the good in others. But you've been hurt. Badly hurt. The pain hasn't quite gone away. ", "Ian: I think that's enough, don't you? ", "Amy: You're angry again. ", "Ian: No, I'm -- ", "amy: Well, then there's no reason why we shouldn't continue. ", "Ian: No. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Hey, you got to come back to the real world. ", "Valerie: My sweet hope.

", "Jamal: Stop, I can't do this. ", "Valerie: I don't want anyone but you. I'm falling apart. ", "Jamal: All right, all right. All right, all right, I'm right here. Ok. All right. I just wish you would hate me instead of punishing yourself like this.", "Valerie: You did what you had to do. Everyone did what they had to do. And I'll do what i have to do.

Oh, my gosh, you know everything about everything! So now it's payback. Ok, let's talk about you for a change. ", "Rafe: Boring subject. ", "Alison: Well, I will be the judge of that. Well, now, maybe we'll find out what's really going on, rafe, if i read this little journal that you've been hiding lately. ", "Rafe: No. Give me that back. ", "Alison: Oh, right. Make me. Let's see what's really going on with rafe these days, huh? Shall we? ", "Rafe: No, alison, don't! Ow! Ow! ", "Alison: Rafe! Rafe? Rafe? ", "Rafe: Ok, that's new. ", "Alison: I'm sorry. ", "Rafe: That hurts. ", "Alison: I'm sorry. ", "Rafe: Why did you do that? What's wrong with you? ", "Alison: I'm sorry. I don't know. I was just hurt and I wanted the whole world to hurt.

", "Frank: You know, if it weren't for the fact that we have been looking for vampires for the last few months, I would say he's crazy. ", "Eve: Ok. Do me a favor, will you?

Are you lost? ", "Chris: No. Actually, I figured I have a few more years to kill, and what better way to do it than here, practicing medicine with you. ", "Eve: How generous of you. ", "Chris: Just don't schedule me for saturday nights, ok? ", "Eve: Done. Welcome back, doctor. ", "Chris: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ", "Eve: You're still a jackass, chris. But you're my jackass. Ok. Problem solved. I can do this. I can do this. I am in control of my work and my personal life. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Amy: Do you want me to stop? ", "Ian: Yeah, I think maybe that's a good idea. ", "Amy: You should try this with eve sometime. ", "Ian: I would if she stood still long enough, sure. ", "Amy: Well, just close your eyes. Touch her face and see what you can discover.
