        "Ian's voice: Name it. ",
        "Elizabeth's voice: You have to promise \r\nme not to come back here again. You just can't be showing up here, being a \r\nreminder of our little indiscretion. ",

        "Chris: Let me see that, please. His \r\nwhite blood cell count is 16,000. This man's appendix is about to burst. Get him \r\nto surgery. What the hell's wrong with you? A first-year med school student \r\ncould've picked that up hours ago. Ian, I asked you a question.\r\n\n",

        "Alison: Yeah, I did. I was just about \r\nto head over to the loft to drop my stuff off. What's going on? ",
        "Rafe: What's going on is -- is I hate \r\nthis. Ok, I changed my mind. I don't want you moving in with Caleb and your \r\nmother, all right? ",
        "Alison: Ok, look. I know -- I know you \r\nhate this. I hate this, too. But this might be our only chance to figure out if \r\nCaleb really set us up. And I know that you will be watching me the entire time. \r\nIt's going to be ok. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, well, I don't want you \r\nplanting any cameras unless -- unless you're 100% secure.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Rafe: Ok? You got to make sure Caleb \r\nis nowhere near the loft, and the same goes for your mother. ",
        "Alison: Listen, we've been over this \r\nplan, like, a hundred times. I just got off the phone with her. She's heading \r\nover to Caleb's because he's going to be rehearsing with the band for a little \r\nwhile. She's going to go over there and talk with him. ",
        "Rafe: Still, I mean, if you're \r\nuncomfortable or -- ",

        "Elizabeth: Of course I am. I wish he \r\nhad more time to spend with me, but -- ",

        "Elizabeth: I know his music's \r\nimportant.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Sure. I'm sure it's very \r\nimportant. Is this the life that you really want? ",
        "Elizabeth: What, being married to a \r\nrock star? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Among other things, it \r\ngets kind of wild. But are you guys happy together? You know, life as a couple?\r\n",

        "Elizabeth: What do you mean? \r\n",
        "Alison: I just -- I meant -- I don't \r\nknow. It seems like you're pretty dependent on him for your happiness, and it \r\njust kind of reminds me of how you were with daddy a little bit. ",
        "Elizabeth: Sweetie, you don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Alison: I understand more than you \r\nknow. I'm not a little kid anymore. I really hope that you know you can always \r\ntalk to me if something's bothering you. ",
