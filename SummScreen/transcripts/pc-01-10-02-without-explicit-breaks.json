        "kevin: All right, fine. So i'm no picasso. ",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "kevin: Hey, victor. Come on in. Any luck finding that missing watch? ",
        "Victor: No, but I haven't been this excited since carl and linda sagan asked \r\nme to help them with that message we sent into space from pioneer 10 and 11. \r\nFrank and I are headed out to the impact site. See, maybe we missed something. \r\nWould you like to come along? ",
        "Kevin: On a watch hunt? No, thanks, I'll pass. ",
        "Victor: All right, all right, but just suppose that this mysterious device \r\nactually did come from another planet -- and don't forget it suddenly \r\ndisappeared into thin air. ",
        "Kevin: So you believe. ",
        "Victor: And will continue to do so until a logical alternative presents \r\nitself. I may be a tad eccentric, but I'm not crazy. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, so if I'm going to miss the field trip, what can i do? ",
        "Victor: You can help me profile the alien. ",
        "Kevin: Excuse me? ",
        "Victor: Suppose you're new to this planet. What do you do? Do you seek out \r\npeople, or do you hide from them? Do you get a job? Or if you need a cover, what \r\nkind of a cover would you look for? ",
        "Paige: So, kev, you ready to -- oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. \r\nIs everything all right? ",
        "Casey: If you hadn't tried to con me, we wouldn't be in this mess right now.\r\n",
        "Ricky: And if you weren't such a loser, we wouldn't have gotten busted in the \r\nfirst place. ",
        "Officer: Ok, kids, empty your pockets. You're off to booking. ",
        "Casey: This is a mistake, man. If you don't let me go right now, you'll be in \r\nbig trouble because my dad knows the governor. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, and I know the pope. ",
        "Officer: Necklaces, bracelets, all of them, miss. ",
        "Casey: Wait, no, you can't have this. ",
        "Ricky: They'll give it back. Well, unless you boosted that, too. ",
        "Casey: No. Look, I've just had this key forever. I never take it off. ",
        "Ricky: Just do it, casey. ",
        "Officer: Come on. Thank you. ",
        "Casey: Hey, it really is mine, ok? Don't take it away from me, please. Please \r\ndon't take it away. ",
        "Valerie: Give me another baby, jamal. Please, that's all i want, please. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie -- we can't do this. ",
        "Rafe: I want you so much. ",

        "paige: Why are you looking at me like that? ",
        "Victor: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. It's old habit. ",
        "Kevin: My father is trying to figure out how to spot the aliens amongst us.\r\n",
        "Paige: Why, whatever do you mean? ",
        "Victor: My son occasionally masks his enthusiasm so as not to be mistaken for \r\nhis father. ",
        "Paige: Oh, so you really believe that strange watch is from another planet?\r\n",
        "Victor: Well, I can't prove it yet, but I certainly intend to keep -- you \r\narrived in town the night the mysterious light appeared, didn't you? ",
        "Paige: Yes, but i still have my watch. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, i have mine, too. ",
        "Paige: Would you care to take a closer look? ",
        "Kevin: Ok, victor, I think that's enough inspection. ",
        "Victor: All I can say is if you were our alien, welcome. And I hope you will \r\nbring many other aliens nearly as beautiful as you. ",
        "Abbiento. ",
        "Kevin: Abbiento. I love my father, but he's a bit eccentric. ",
        "Paige: Hmm, but charming. Aliens, indeed. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, I'm not about to rule out what he says. ",
        "Paige: Oh, so you really believe in little green men? ",
        "Kevin: Well, that watch wasn't made of anything found on earth, and there's \r\nstill no explanation for that light that hit town on new year's eve. ",
        "Paige: Well, nobody was hurt, so does it really matter? ",
        "Kevin: You would have had to live in port charles over the last year or so. \r\nIt's been kind of a bermuda triangle of strange events. ",
        "Paige: Ah, so why aren't you out on that hunt for E.T. With dad? ",
        "Kevin: Because I want him to be wrong. ",
        "Paige: Hmm. ",
        "Kevin: I want there to be a reasonable explanation for this. And in my line \r\nof work, that's called denial. Besides, i've been trying to revive my so-called \r\nartistic skills, and I'm failing miserably. ",
        "Paige: Oh, I doubt that. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, really? Would you care to tour my gallery? ",
        "Paige: Well, you're just a little rusty. ",
        "Kevin: No, what i am, paige, is just a little talented. You need a real \r\nartist to paint your portrait, paige. I'm going to call a friend of mine down in \r\nnew york. This guy is amazing. His stuff hangs in museums. I mean, he just had a \r\nsold-out show in the village. I mean, he's the man that you need. He's a genius.\r\n",
        "Paige: No, kevin, you don't understand. It has to be you. No one else can do \r\nthis. It has to be you. ",
        "Valerie: But you said you would give me anything. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, it's not right. Ok, we can't just have another baby to take \r\nthe place of hope. It just doesn't work like that. ",
        "Valerie: I made a mistake, jamal, by giving her up, and then i realized what \r\na blessing she was. And a child would be so good for us. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, there is no us! Now, we're not a family! We're not even \r\ntogether, valerie! I am with ali, ok? ",
        "Valerie: Then you lied to me. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm sorry. ",
        "Valerie: You're always sorry. So tell me how i'm suppose to deal with this \r\nloss, because it's tearing me up inside! It's killing me! And without hope, I \r\nhave nothing! ",
        "Jamal: That's not true, valerie. ",
        "Valerie: I have nothing! I just want to die! Just let me die, jamal! God, why \r\ndon't you -- ",
        "alison: Wait. Rafe, rafe -- rafe, rafe, stop, stop, stop. I can'T. I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Rafe: What? What? ",
        "Alison: This is a really big mistake. This is such a mistake. I'm so sorry. I \r\ndon't know what I'm doing. ",
        "Rafe: But maybe -- ",
        "alison: No, no, no, no, no. This is a really big mistake. I -- god, i'm \r\nacting like such a baby. This is all my fault. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no. ",
        "Alison: I wasn't getting what i needed from jamal, so i totally threw myself \r\nat you. My god, you seduced an angel! ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "alison: I'm so -- please don't. I'm so sorry. I can't -- I love jamal. I love \r\njamal. My life is built around jamal. I'm so sorry. This was a really big \r\nmistake. I have to go. I'm sorry. ",
        "Rafe: No. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. Rt ",
        "ricky: Would you knock it off? You're making me dizzy. ",
        "Casey: I got to get that key back, man. I can't be without it. ",
        "Ricky: Chill out. You want them to cuff you? ",
        "Casey: Ok. Just got get a major, major grip. ",
        "Ricky: You ok? ",
        "Casey: Shut up! ",
        "Ricky: What's up with that key, and why is it so important? ",
        "Casey: Hey, look, it's just none of your business. ",
        "Ricky: Fine. Melt down. See if i care. But I could get it back for you. ",
        "Casey: You can? How? ",
        "Ricky: You told me to shut up. ",
        "Casey: God, I hate you. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, that's really working. ",
        "Casey: Ok. All right, like, i really, really need that key, ok? Can you \r\nplease help me? ",
        "Ricky: One condition. ",
        "Casey: I'm not sleeping with you. ",
        "Ricky: Who's asking? All you have to do is admit that it was you who lifted \r\nthat necklace from the jewelry store. ",
        "Casey: Ha! No way. Uh-uh. ",
        "Ricky: Ok. ",
        "Casey: What's the big deal, man? It's just shoplifting. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, to you it is, but to me, it's another line on my rap sheet, \r\nwhich could send me back to prison, where I'm not going to go, not for you or \r\nanybody else. ",
        "Casey: Oh, I get it. So i get to go to jail instead, huh? Great. ",
        "Ricky: You told me you didn't have a record. Now, unless you were lying about \r\nthat, too, they'll go easier on you. ",
        "Casey: You sure? You know, because I can't be locked up, man. I got places to \r\ngo. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, yeah, yeah, new york, new york. ",
        "Casey: Can you really help meget my key back? ",
        "Ricky: No, because we don't have a deal. ",
        "Casey: Ok. Deal. I take the rap, you get my key back. How are we going to do \r\nit? ",
        "Ricky: Leave it to a professional. ",
        "Kevin: I don't understand why it's so important for me to paint your \r\nportrait. ",
        "Paige: It's going to sound silly. ",
        "Kevin: Just tell me. ",
        "Paige: Well, it's a little embarrassing, actually. ",
        "Kevin: Look, it's just you and me here. ",
        "Paige: All right. Kevin, you were my first love, the man I thought I was \r\ngoing to spend the rest of my life with. I'm sorry. I'm making you \r\nuncomfortable. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no. No, no. It's ok, really. It's just that -- I remember. I \r\nfelt that way, too. We were so young. You know, I can still remember the first \r\nday I met you. ",
        "Paige: Hmm, at that cafe in geneva. ",
        "Kevin: Yep. You were wearing a green scarf. The wind blew it off, and I \r\nchased it down the street and I brought it back to you, and you -- you smiled \r\nthis amazing smile. That was it. I was done. I was in love. ",
        "Paige: Well, you always did come to my rescue. ",
        "Kevin: No, I just couldn't believe my dumb luck. ",
        "God, you were beautiful. You still are. And my wife is determined to find out \r\nwhy. But, paige, that still doesn't make me an artist. ",
        "Paige: But that's what you don't understand, kevin. I've known many artists. \r\nI've had ample opportunity to have my portrait painted. But we're really only \r\never allowed one first love, aren't we? And mine happened to be this \r\nextraordinarily talented man who once promised to paint my portrait. Look, I \r\ndon't have anyone left who remembers me the way i was. I want my portrait \r\npainted by somebody who really knows who i am. I want my whole heart and soul on \r\nthat canvas. I want something that will last, that will mark my time here on \r\nthis earth. ",
        "Kevin: Paige, you'll have lots of time to make your mark. ",
        "Paige: Yes, of course. I know that. ",
        "[E-mail beeps] ",
        "kevin: Oh, it's an e-mail. ",
        "Paige: Is everything all right? ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's lucy. And with her, you never know. I better go up there.\r\n",
        "Paige: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Just you get some rest, ok? ",
        "Valerie: And you're not going to leave, are you? ",
        "Jamal: No, no. I'm right here. ",
        "Alison: Hi. ",
        "Jamal: I'm glad you're here. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Me, too. We're in some serious trouble, aren't we? ",
        "Jamal: We've been better. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, i love you, and you are my whole life. And I feel like I'm \r\nlosing you and I don't know how to stop it. You know, we've always been this \r\nreally good team, we've always been really connected, and i just -- i feel like \r\nwe could always finished each other's thoughts if we really wanted to, but \r\nlately, I just feel like i'm trying -- ",
        "jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: To reach out to you, and I'm trying to hold on, but I can't reach out \r\nhard enough or -- and get to you fast enough and -- ",
        "jamal: Ok, ali, ali, ali -- ",
        "alison: You know, jamal, listen to me, I'm scared. Where did we go wrong? \r\nWhat did we do? Where did we slip up? I feel like we really need to fix this \r\nfast before one of us does something really -- valerie's here? Valerie's in my \r\nbed? ",
        "Jamal: She completely flipped out. I didn't know where else to take her, ali.\r\n",
        "Alison: So you brought her home with you -- ",
        "jamal: I couldn't leave her in the street. I couldn't leave her out there.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, my god. I can't believe this. This is never going to end, ever.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Ali, calm down, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok, whatever. I'm leaving. I'm getting out of here. I can't do this. \r\nI'm getting out of here, anywhere. And sleeping beauty is not and you are not -- \r\nget out my way. I'm serious. ",
        "Officer: What is it? ",
        "Ricky: Officer, can i talk to you in private? Maybe we could step out in the \r\nhall? ",
        "Officer: Make it quick. ",
        "Ricky: I just wanted to say thank you for treating me with such respect and \r\ndignity. All right, you guys get such a bad rap, but as far as i'm concerned, \r\nport charles p.D. Is the best, man! Thanks! ",
        "Officer: Hey, what is your problem, kid? ",
        "Ricky: I'm sorry, officer. You can send me the cleaning bill. ",
        "Officer: Yeah, just get back in the room. ",
        "Casey: So? ",
        "Ricky: Ta-da! Uh-uh-uh-uh, not so fast. You think I'm going to get conned by \r\nyou twice? First, you confess, and then you get your reward. ",
        "Casey: No way, man. First, you give it to me, then i spill. ",
        "Ricky: Hmm. Ok. One of us has to make the first move. Here. ",
        "Casey: Sorry, dude. I changed my mind. I'm not confessing. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, we had a deal. ",
        "Casey: Yeah, and I thought of a better deal. While you were sucking up to ofc. \r\nBozo out there, I figured out a way how to bust us out of here. ",
        "Ricky: What are you doing? Are you crazy? ",
        "Casey: Help! Fire! You know what? Stay here and be a wuss if you want, but \r\ni'm getting the hell out! Fire! ",

        "Smokey: You mean this bar? ",
        "Rafe: No. I mean this town. I should never have come back to port charles. I \r\nhad something really important i had to do, but i -- I pretty much blew it, not \r\nthat this really matters to you, so, nice to -- ",
