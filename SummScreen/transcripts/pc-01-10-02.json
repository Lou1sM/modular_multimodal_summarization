", "Victor: All right, all right, but just suppose that this mysterious device actually did come from another planet -- and don't forget it suddenly disappeared into thin air. ", "Kevin: So you believe. ", "Victor: And will continue to do so until a logical alternative presents itself. I may be a tad eccentric, but I'm not crazy.

Would you care to tour my gallery? ", "Paige: Well, you're just a little rusty. ", "Kevin: No, what i am, paige, is just a little talented. You need a real artist to paint your portrait, paige.
