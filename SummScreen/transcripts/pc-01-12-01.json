        "Kevin: Eve? Eve? Gee, thanks for calling. Why would you check out of the hospital and not \r\ntell me? Eve! ",

        "Kevin: E-- ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, it's me. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, not now. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, now. Doc, if we don't talk right now, we will both regret it for \r\nthe rest of our lives. ",

        "Gabriela's voice: I was so happy to find out that Ian was -- or is, rather, \r\nin love with somebody. ",
        "Eve's voice: Who? ",
        "Gabriela's voice: I don't know, but Joe swears that he's found the love of his life.\r\n",

        "Arianna: No, I'm ok. I'm sorry I broke down like that. ",
        "Ian: Don't apologize. It's ok. ",
        "Arianna: I've been so edgy all day. ",
        "Ian: Well, maybe if you told me what was going on, I could help you. ",
        "Arianna: You know, I wish I could. It's just -- ",
        "[noise] ",
        "Arianna: Don't let him in. Don't let him in! ",
        "Ian: Who? Don't let who in? ",
        "Arianna: No, no, I'm begging you, please, don't let anyone in. ",
        "Ian: Stay here. Relax. I'll go see who it is. Be right back. ",
        "Ian: Eve. ",
        "Eve: Ian. Hi. I -- I was just about to knock. ",
        "Ian: I heard you were being released. I thought you were going home. I mean, \r\nare you all right? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I am going home, but, uh -- but I just wanted to stop by here \r\nfirst and tell you that I'm really -- thank you so much for everything that \r\nyou've done for me. Um, I just -- I had the cab drop me by here first. ",
        "Ian: I'm glad you did. Well, I'm in the middle of something. Why don't you \r\ngive me five minutes and I'll take you home?",
        "Eve: No, that's ok. The cab's waiting. I'm really sorry that I interrupted \r\nwhatever is going on. ",
        "Ian: Eve -- ",
        "Eve: No, I got to go, really. The cab's waiting. Thanks, though. Thanks for \r\neverything. ",
        "Arianna: Who was it? ",
        "Ian: Just a good friend coming by to say hello. ",
        "Arianna: You're sure? ",
        "Ian: Yes, I'm sure. I'm sorry. What -- what are you so frightened of? ",
        "Arianna: Nothing you can help me with. ",
        "Ian: Maybe you're right, but sometimes talking about things puts it into \r\nperspective. ",
        "Arianna: Not this thing. They're never going to go away. They're not going to \r\nstop until -- they're just going to -- ",
        "Ian: Who? What are you talking about? Who's not going to stop? Ok, you don't \r\nwant to talk, I'll talk. I think that the night you hit Eve, you were so busy \r\nlooking over your shoulder you never saw her run into the street. You were so \r\nbusy looking for someone who was chasing you. And maybe that's the same someone \r\nwho bailed you out of jail. And maybe that's why you wanted to stay in jail. \r\nWhat is it? I don't know. What happened to you? What did you do? ",
        "Arianna: Nothing. I didn't do a thing. ",
        "Ian: So what are you running for? ",
        "Arianna: For my life. ",
        "Ian: Someone wants to kill you? ",
        "Arianna: Yes. ",
        "Ian: Why? Arianna, why? ",
        "Arianna: It's not your concern. ",
        "Ian: It's not my concern? Well, you followed me to my house. It's my concern \r\nnow. Was kind of thinking that maybe you're here because I could help you. ",
        "Arianna: I'm not some sort of criminal, if that's what you're thinking. ",
        "Ian: I'm not thinking anything. I would love to know what we're up against. \r\nAnd if you don't want to tell me what you're running from, at least tell me who. \r\nWho's chasing you? Who wants you dead? ",
        "Arianna: My family. ",
        "",
        "Karen: What are you doing out of the hospital? ",
        "Eve: I was ready to go. ",
        "Karen: As pale as you are? I don't think so. Does Kevin know you've been \r\nreleased? I mean, he just called here a while ago looking for you. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh, Kevin. I'd better call him. ",
        "Karen: I mean, the poor guy was out of his mind. ",
        "Eve: I wasn't thinking. I wasn't thinking. Kevin, hi, it's me. Yeah, I'm so \r\nsorry to worry you. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. Listen, I'm fine, though. I'm \r\nat Karen's house and -- no, no, no, no. No, no, I have a cab outside waiting for \r\nme, and so I'll just -- I'll come home in a little bit. But I really need to \r\ntalk to Karen for a couple minutes, ok? I'm sorry, sweetheart, and -- I love \r\nyou, too. Ok. Bye. ",
        "Karen: Talk to me about what? ",
        "Eve: Come on. I -- I took your advice about talking to Ian. ",
        "Karen: And that's why you left the hospital? ",
        "Eve: I had to find out what happened between us while we were held hostage.\r\n",
        "Karen: Well, did you find out? ",
        "Eve: Well, I -- I went to his apartment and I went charging in, like always.\r\n",
        "Karen: And? ",
        "Eve: He was there with another woman, and she was beautiful. ",
        "Karen: What did you do? ",
        "[Eve laughs]",
        "Eve: Well, I tried to get out of there without them seeing me, but Ian caught \r\nup to me in the hallway, and I made some stupid, silly excuse about dropping by \r\njust to say thank you for everything, and it just -- it sounded so fake. Even I \r\nknew that. ",
        "Karen: Oh, come on, I'm sure it didn't sound as stupid as you think. ",
        "Eve: Karen, they're lovers. Anyone could see that. I mean, he was so \r\nprotective of her. He didn't even want to admit to me that she was there. ",
        "Karen: Eve, I'm sorry. I -- ",
        "Eve: No, I don't -- Karen, I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot. I love Kevin. \r\nHe is the most perfect person. I mean, I could never dream about having a better \r\npartner in life. ",
        "Karen: So why do you keep fantasizing about Ian? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. But now that I know that they are just fantasies and that \r\nnothing ever actually happened between us, that makes it even worse. Ian is \r\nprobably making love to that woman right now -- the woman he loves -- and I'm \r\nsitting here acting like a lovesick teenager. Karen, what -- what is going on \r\nwith me? What's wrong with me? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: So Eve checked herself out of the hospital and went to Karen's? ",
        "Kevin: She's fine, Lucy. That's what matters. Now, why are you here? ",
        "Lucy: I'm here -- I'm here because I couldn't just leave things the way they \r\nwere between us. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, you never can. ",
        "Lucy: But we said some really mean things to each other. I was so hurt and so \r\nangry, and I really had to tell you I'm sorry. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, I was pretty angry myself. ",
        "Lucy: I know. But see, that's the difference -- you had a right to be angry. \r\nI shouldn't have changed those DNA results. You know, when I thought about it, \r\nit is far-fetched. It was wrong. ",
        "Kevin: \"Far-fetched?\" Lucy, that was awful. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, it was awful. But what made it even more awful, Doc, is I promised \r\nyou just a while ago that I would never, ever lie to you again. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, you did. ",
        "Lucy: I did. And at the time I really meant it. I did! And I don't know what \r\nhappened to me. I don't know what comes over me sometimes. I guess I just can't \r\nchange, that's it. I'll never learn. I'll just never, ever learn. ",
        "Kevin: That's actually a small measure of progress. That's actually a -- a \r\ngood thing. So don't be so hard on yourself. ",
        "Lucy: No, I have to be, because I need to make progress here. I really need \r\nto change some things. ",
        "Kevin: But, Lucy, we can't do that just by snapping our fingers, you know.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I know that. But you can make small, little baby steps, and that's what \r\nI'm going to try and do right now with -- with these. ",
        "Kevin: Your cards? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You know, other people really use them correctly. They read what \r\nthey are telling them. Not me. I like to just read into them whatever I want to, \r\nbend them to my will. Well, you know what? I can't do that anymore. I have to \r\nstop it. I have got to get rid of that part of me. ",
        "Kevin: So that's your answer? ",
        "Lucy: No. No, it's not my answer. It's just a symbol of what I'm trying to do \r\nhere, Doc. I'm -- I'm trying to show you that I want to be the kind of person \r\nthat you can respect. Because I have to be in your life. I have to be a part of \r\nyour life. So please, Doc, do not shut me out. Don't walk away from me. Please?",
        "",
        "Ian: I've spent a lot of time in different countries. I know there's some \r\npeculiar customs going on. ",
        "Arianna: I broke the rules. They want me dead because I went against the way \r\nof things. ",
        "Ian: Do you think you did something wrong? ",
        "Arianna: I had no choice in the matter. ",
        "Ian: So you ran? ",
        "Arianna: I started to feel that I was free, that I had gotten away. But the \r\nnight of the accident, when I hit your friend, I saw his face. ",
        "Ian: His face? ",
        "Arianna: My brother. ",
        "Ian: Oh. ",
        "Arianna: So I started running again. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: And you stayed in jail because you thought you'd be safe there. ",
        "Arianna: I knew the money for bail came from him, that he'd be waiting for me \r\nthe moment I stepped out the door. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. Take it easy. ",
        "Arianna: He's never going to stop. You don't understand. He's just going to \r\ntrack me down until -- ",
        "Ian: Hey, wait, wait a sec. I'm not going to let that happen. ",
        "Arianna: But I almost killed someone you care deeply for. ",
        "Ian: I know you didn't hit my friend on purpose. ",
        "Arianna: You told her husband that nothing was going on between you and his \r\nwife. ",
        "Ian: And nothing was going on between us. ",
        "Arianna: But you love her. I saw it and heard it the night of the accident.\r\n",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: Do you know how there are some things you don't like to talk about? \r\nWell, I respect that. There's some things that I don't want to talk about, \r\neither, and Dr. Lambert is the number one thing. ",
        "Arianna: I'd give anything to have a man care about me the way you care for \r\nher. ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "Arianna: What I don't understand is how you can feel that way about somebody \r\nand walk away. ",
        "",
        "Eve: What do I do, Karen? ",
        "Karen: Let's go back to the last thing you're sure of, the last true thing \r\nyou remember, ok? So what is it? ",
        "Eve: I -- I remember our wedding day. Standing by the water, saying our vows, \r\nlooking into his eyes. That is the last time I know for sure about how I felt \r\nabout anything. ",
        "Karen: So maybe if you spend more time with him and reconnect with those \r\nfeelings -- ",
        "Eve: Right, the fantasies about Ian will go away. ",
        "Karen: Yeah. If you want them to. ",
        "Eve: Of course I want them to. I want all this to stop. I want my life to go \r\nback to the way it was before all this craziness with Ian started. ",
        "Karen: Well, all this craziness with Ian started before you were kidnapped.\r\n",
        "Eve: Listen, it was just one kiss, and I told you that I regretted it the \r\nminute it happened. ",
        "Karen: You're sure? ",
        "Eve: And if I can just stay away from Ian, everything will be fine. ",
        "Karen: Well, what if he decides to go back to work at G.H.? ",
        "Eve: Then I'll just have to get a job someplace else. You know, I mean, I \r\ncan't be around Ian because when I am, I make all the wrong choices. Kevin is my \r\nhusband. I love him and he loves me. ",
        "Karen: Right. ",
        "Eve: Right. Ian is the problem. ",
        "Karen: So you figure you spend more time with Kevin and less time thinking \r\nabout Ian and the rest goes away. ",
        "Eve: Right. No more confusion, no more roller coaster. That's what I need and \r\nthat's what I want. Right now. ",
        "Karen: Wait, where are you going? ",
        "Eve: Home, to be with my husband. That's where I belong. Thanks. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: So what do you say, Doc? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I think you need to get your own life in order. ",
        "Lucy: You're right, I do. But I can't do that without you because you are \r\njust right smack-dab in the middle of it. And I can't do that if you hate me.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I don't hate you. ",
        "Lucy: Sure feels like it. ",
        "Kevin: I'm just mad. You made a mistake. ",
        "Lucy: I know. You know, I make a lot of those. I guess I've ruined a lot of \r\nrelationships that way, and I don't know why. I guess it's because I'm -- I'm \r\njust so -- ",
        "Kevin: Impulsive? ",
        "Lucy: Impulsive. Yeah. That's right. You always know the right thing to say. \r\nAnd you always know what I'm trying to do. You always seem to be able to see \r\nwhat it was I meant to do. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, don't do that. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I can't help it. I am so scared. I don't -- I don't want to lose \r\nyou. So just tell me what it is you want me to do. Tell me how I can make it \r\nbetter. Tell me what you want. ",
        "Kevin: Nothing. ",
        "Lucy: But I need to -- ",
        "Kevin: I don't want you to change. Just be who you are. ",
        "[Kevin sighs] ",
        "Kevin: You're a woman who thinks with her heart. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Impulsive? ",
        "Kevin: Impulsive, and sometimes that leads to disaster. But more often than \r\nthat, it just turns out so right. You've certainly turned my life around more \r\nthan once. Even when I've been at my worst of times, you never gave up on me, \r\nLucy. And I don't want to lose you. ",
        "Lucy: I love you, Doc. I love you so much and for so long. ",
        "Kevin: No. No, please, Lucy. We have to stop this. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I thought you might be hungry, but maybe you need sleep more than food.\r\n",
        "Arianna: No, I need both. Thank you. No matter what, I can't seem to sleep \r\nenough. ",
        "Ian: Stress can do that to you. ",
        "Arianna: Well, maybe if I talked a bit less, I'd have more time to close my \r\neyes. I'm trying to apologize, you know. ",
        "Ian: Apologize for what? ",
        "Arianna: If I said too much earlier about the way I can see your feelings \r\ntowards Eve. ",
        "Ian: Apology accepted. ",
        "Arianna: I haven't felt this safe in a really long time or had someone to \r\ntalk to. ",
        "Ian: Well, you got both. ",
        "Arianna: Does that mean I can stay with you? ",
        "Ian: What you need to do is sleep and not worry about things. I'll help you \r\nwith your troubles. But for now I've got to leave for a little bit. ",
        "Arianna: You going to go see her? Eve? It was her upstairs earlier, wasn't --\r\n",
        "Ian: Arianna. Here's my number. It's a cell phone, so you can call me if you \r\nneed me, all right? Won't be far. ",
        "Arianna: Oh, before you go, wait. I need you to see what my brother looks \r\nlike in case he turns up. That's Ben. ",
        "Ian: You guys seem very close -- in this picture, anyway. ",
        "Arianna: We were. Once we were. Now -- ",
        "Ian: Get some rest. ",
        "Arianna: Thank you. ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "Arianna: Thank you. ",

        "Arianna: Thanks. ",
        "",
        "Ben: Well, forgive me for disturbing, but I'm new to your town. I was \r\nwondering if you could help me. Well, I just overheard when you came in you work \r\nacross the street. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, at General Hospital. ",
        "Ben: That's the reason I sought you out. I have a sister. We had a \r\ndisagreement. I'm concerned. That's what brought me to your town. ",
        "Karen: Looking for your sister? ",
        "Ben: Yes. And last we heard, she may have visited not long ago your hospital. \r\nAnd perhaps you've seen her. Her name is Arianna. ",
        "Karen: Sorry. No. But you know, if you're really worried, you should get in \r\ntouch with the police. That's the way we do things in this country. ",
        "Ben: Well, we'd prefer to handle this situation within the family. No one \r\nelse need be involved in her trouble. ",
        "Karen: That's your choice. ",
        "Ben: It's not really my choice. Where I come from, all that matters is the \r\nfamily. What the family says is law. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: What did I do, Doc? Why do I have to stop? ",
        "Kevin: Not you, not you, Lucy -- us. We have to stop opening ourselves up to \r\neach other like this. ",
        "Lucy: Why? That's what we always do. ",
        "Kevin: But that has to change. We open the door just a little bit and our \r\nfeelings just explode all over each other and then we just end up feeling \r\nguilty. And you were right about that. That's why I blew up at you the way I \r\ndid. Well, what you did was bad, but this is a big part of that. ",
        "Lucy: You feel guilty because we made love together. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, if I'd opened the damn door, Eve never would've been hit by a \r\ncar! ",
        "Lucy: I know that, Doc, and there is plenty, plenty of guilt to go around. \r\nBut that doesn't mean we could ever cut ourselves off from each other. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, we should, and we can. ",
        "Lucy: No, we can't. Doc, look at me. ",
        "Kevin: No -- ",
        "Lucy: Look, just -- just look at me. Look what happens. Look at me. It's \r\nthere. Don't you see it? I know you feel it. It happens when we look at each \r\nother, and it's going to be there always because it always has been. ",
        "Kevin: But, Lucy, that's what has to change. I can't let it matter now, so \r\nneither can you. Vows were taken. Eve is my wife. ",
        "Lucy: And you have always loved me deep in your heart. ",
        "Kevin: For God's sake, Lucy, don't you understand? I can't love you the way \r\nyou deserve. I can't! ",
