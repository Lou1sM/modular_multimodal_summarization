        "To stop Ian from biting Elizabeth, Lucy reports a fire at Caleb's loft. The two vampires are stopped cold by the sudden activation of the sprinkler system, which leaves them soaking wet. Lucy stops by the loft, feigning innocence, but Ian is onto her. She convinces him to leave with her, which angers Elizabeth. Back at Ian's place, Lucy nags until he drinks some of the water. She informs him that she has left Kevin.",
        "Tess renders Caleb unable to sing to Olivia. She doesn't want him to use his gift of music to do harm. Caleb denies her claim that there is goodness in him. Meanwhile, Jack rushes home to Tess after figuring out who Reese really is. Caleb vanishes when he hears Jack just outside the door. Going to the rehearsal hall, he tries again, but he still can't sing. He has a dream in which Tess comes to him. Jack and Tess have a private wedding at home."

        "Lucy: Oh, Ian, no, you can't -- you can't do it. You can't. I got to stop it. I have to stop you. Oh!",

        "Jack: Look, miss, I --",
        "Reese: Reese.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, Reese. I really don't think your leg's broken and I really need to go. I have a really special night tonight.",
        "Reese: It could be a special night for us, Jack.",
        "Jack: What did you just say?",
        "Reese: Hmm?",
        "Jack: How did you know my name?",
        "Reese: Sorry.",
        "Jack: Wait a second. You're -- you're that girl in Caleb's band. I knew you looked familiar. You're that --",
        "Reese: Caleb? Oh, I've never heard of him. I work for a bloke called Stephen Clay. You know, you're so brave and strong. I bet you could show a girl how to do some nasty things, huh?",
        "Jack: He sent you, didn't he?",
        "Reese: Come on, sexy. I won't bite.",
        "Jack: Tess. I got to get back.",
        "Reese: It's too late, Jackie boy. No wedding bells for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: This song's for Olivia, all the things I've wanted to tell her for so long.",
        "Caleb: What have you done?",
        "Tess: Your music is a gift, Stephen. I won't let you use it to do harm.",
        "Caleb: How did you --",
        "Tess: You made me, Stephen. You took all the good out of Livvie and you made me. Now I'm going to use it to protect her from you.",
        "Caleb: You can't --",
        "Tess: But I just did. You won't be able to get to her that way. But maybe I can get to you.",
        "Caleb: A little piece of news for you, Tess -- stronger people than you have tried to appeal to my better nature. Guess what -- my bad side is my good side.",
        "Tess: I won't give up on you, Stephen, not when you're in such pain.",
        "Caleb: What do you know about pain? Hmm? What do you know about anything?",
        "Tess: Maybe you made me for another reason.",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Tess: To help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fireman: Did you hurt yourself, ma'am?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no. No, no, no. That's just a scratch.",
        "Fireman: And you don't look too well, either, sir.",
        "Ian: I'm fine. You said somebody called and said there was a fire?",
        "Fireman: Yeah, our fire alarm activates the system.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, there was no one here except the two of us.",
        "Fireman: Sorry. False alarm.",
        "Ian: Who called?",
        "Lucy: Hey, where's the fire? Was -- was somebody hurt? Was anybody hurt?",
        "Ian: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: I saw the fire trucks and I wanted to come in and make sure that nothing happened, that nobody was hurt here. Um -- oh, pardon me. Hi, Elizabeth. It's nice to see -- you know, I haven't had a chance to chat to you since we were at that lovely wedding. Congratulations. You know -- hi, guys. Now that I'm here, I think I'm going to give you a ride home because --",
        "Fireman: Excuse me, ma'am. We need to check out the roof just to be on the safe side.",
        "Lucy: Oh, please. Please do.",
        "Elizabeth: I'll be right back.",
        "Lucy: Don't hurry.",

        "[Ian groans]",
        "Lucy: Look at you. You are in bad shape.",
        "Ian: I'm fine. Just go home.",
        "Lucy: No, I am not about to leave you alone in this bat cave.",
        "Ian: There's nothing you can do for me. It's too late.",
        "Lucy: Like hell it is. Come on, I'm going to get you out of here. We are getting out of here. Come on.",
        "Elizabeth: Ian, the firemen are leaving, but -- Ian? That witch!",

        "Caleb: You think you can help me?",
        "Tess: If you'll let me.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, and how exactly are you going to help me?",
        "Tess: Free the darkness around you.",
        "Caleb: Darkness suits me just fine.",
        "Tess: When I look at you, I -- I see a spark of light deep inside your soul.",
        "Caleb: Look again. I have no soul.",
        "Tess: It's there. Buried. But it's there.",
        "Caleb: I think I liked you better when you didn't speak.",
        "Tess: Why do you fight so hard? If you loved Livvie, there must be some goodness.",
        "Caleb: You actually believe that, don't you? There is no goodness. There's no light beneath the layers of what I've been and who I am. What you see is at you get.",
        "Tess: What I see is someone who has been hurt, who hurts back because they know no other way. Aren't you tired of being feared and hunted down? Doesn't some part of you want to be loved?",
        "Caleb: What do you want me to tell you? That you're right? Is that it? That if you touch me, somehow I'll fall to my knees and feel like I've been saved?",
        "Tess: You have a heart capable of great love. I can hear it beating. Please, Stephen, just listen to it.",
        "Jack: Tess -- are you all right?",
        "Tess: I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Tess: What are you doing?",
        "Jack: I just wanted to make sure you're all right.",
        "Tess: I'm fine. I missed you. You were gone so long.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well -- I'm here now, so everything's going to be ok.",
        "Tess: Ok. You don't have to worry, Jack. No one's going to hurt me. I just want you to love me.",
        "Jack: Well, I can do that. Hmm. The minister's going to be here soon.",
        "Tess: Well, how do I look?",
        "Jack: You look beautiful.",
        "Tess: And I want to be beautiful for you. I want to be everything to you. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Take it easy. Hey, why don't you sit on the couch? Listen to me. You have to -- you -- you have to drink this. It'll take the pain away. Drink this.",
        "Ian: No, I don't like the way it makes me feel.",
        "Ian: Barely what? Human. You can say it. It's ok.",
        "Lucy: No, I wasn't going to say that. What I was going to say is you can barely stand up. You -- you were going to bite Elizabeth back there, weren't you?",
        "Ian: How'd you know?",
        "Lucy: I -- I just know. I'm a slayer. I can feel these things. You know, instead of asking me questions, what you should be doing is thanking me for breaking up that God-awful party.",
        "Ian: I can't believe we're having this conversation right now.",
        "Lucy: Neither can I, and I can't believe you don't realize -- do you know what almost happened? If you bit her, you would lose any chance you have for a normal life. Do you understand? If you give into these cravings, if you bite anybody, if you taste that blood, then you're going to be one of them and you will crave it more and more and more and then you're not -- you'll want to kill somebody is what you're going to want to do.",
        "Ian: That would never happen.",
        "Lucy: Really? And what we're talking about you believed could happen, what we're saying? Do you realize what you almost did back there?",
        "Ian: Which is exactly why you need to leave right now.",
        "Lucy: No. I'm not going. Listen to me -- I'm not leaving you because that Mrs. Dracula back there can't keep her hands off of you, and I'm not going to take the chance of you attempting to go back to her.",
        "Ian: No, it's not safe. I'm not safe. You need to go.",
        "Lucy: I -- I'm ok. I have to keep telling you this? I'm a slayer. You can't bite me.",
        "Ian: I have a feeling I could kill you in many ways.",
        "Lucy: I'm ok. I'll be fine, really.",
        "Ian: Yeah? What are you going to tell Kevin?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I don't know if I'm going to tell him anything. I -- I left him tonight. I --",
        "Ian: You did what?",
        "Lucy: Ok, that's it.",
        "[Ian groans]",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. Come here. You're going to drink this. You are going to drink it --",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Lucy: Yes, you are. You're not going to be a hero.",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Lucy: You're going to drink it. I don't want to lose you, ok? I don't want the dark side to get you. I won't let you be. You're going to take a sip of this -- please? I'm more stubborn than you. You got to drink it. Damn it, Ian, just drink it!",
        "Ian: What am I, Lucy? What have I become?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Wow. Don't you look beautiful.",
        "Tess: Thank you. I can't wait another minute to be your wife.",
        "Jack: We're ready.",
        "Minister: Tonight we're gathered here to join you together in holy matrimony, a sacrament most blessed, binding husband to wife. Now, I understand you'd like to say your own vows.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Tess, your beauty, your innocence, your loving kindness is more wonderful than anything that I've ever known. When I met you, I found my place in this world and I promise to take care of you and protect you all of my days.",
        "Tess: I thought I was meant to be alone. \"Love\" was just a word I didn't understand until I met you. You brought me to life. And I promise to be a good wife and to give you the family that neither of us ever had. And I will love you as long as I live.",
        "Minister: Do you, Jack, take Tess to be your lawfully wedded wife?",
        "Jack: I do.",
        "Minister: And do you, Tess, take Jack to be your lawfully wedded husband?",
        "Tess: I do.",
        "Minister: Then in the power vested in me by God and this state, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride, young man.",
        "Jack: Oh. Well, this celebration's not over yet. Ms. Ramsey, come with me.",
        "Tess: Jack, what a we doing?",
        "Jack: Ok. All right. You remember what I told you about the stars? Tonight we are going to find the brightest star up there and make a wish -- the Ramseys. Ok? All right. Right there. Ready?",
        "Tess: Ok.",
        "Jack: Now close your eyes.",
        "Tess: I'm so happy right now. I wish that everyone in this world could be as happy as I am right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Hi. So, boss, everything ok?",
        "Caleb: Go in the booth. Put on the tracks for the new song. Get out of my sight.",
        "[Music plays]",
        "[Caleb yells because he can't sing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So it must've helped a little. Do you feel any better at all?",
        "Ian: I never meant for you to see me this way.",
        "Lucy: I know. But I also know you would do exactly the same thing for me.",
        "Ian: So you and Kevin, you --",
        "Lucy: Um, we're -- I -- I can't talk about me and Kevin right now if that's ok. I guess you just need to know he doesn't want me to help him.",
        "Ian: But you think you want to help me. Why?",
        "Lucy: Because I think you want me to. And I know I want to help you and I -- I know you. You're good and I need to believe in you.",
        "Ian: Will you look at us? The reluctant vampire being comforted by the -- by the beautiful slayer.",
        "Lucy: No, it's just Ian and Lucy, and we really need each other now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You look so sad.",
        "Caleb: What have you done to me?",
        "Caleb: You've destroyed me.",
        "Tess: No, Stephen. I've saved you.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jack: I need your help, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Ok, shoot.",
        "Jack: Teach me how to be a vampire slayer.",
        "Kevin: Livvie's gone.",
        "Caleb: Olivia's very much alive. As a matter of fact, I know exactly where she is, and you're going to help me get her back."
