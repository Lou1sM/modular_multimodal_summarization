        "While Rafe watches on the monitors, Alison searches Caleb's loft. Finding a copy of the police report of her father's boating accident, she learns that a third person was on the yacht, but the alleged prince has never been found. She and Rafe decide to go to Capri to do some investigating. Jack is alarmed to learn that Caleb paid Tess a visit, but Tess assures him that she wasn't harmed. Jack doesn't think his new bride realizes how dangerous Caleb can be. He goes to Rafe and insists on being trained to be a vampire slayer. Rafe is skeptical until Jack demonstrates his strength, which he attributes to Caleb's return. Rafe reluctantly agrees to train his friend. Kevin is startled to find Caleb in his home. Caleb fills him in on who and what Tess really is, including the fact that she's keeping Livvie inside her. He enlists Kevin's help to get her back. If Kevin will pretend to be a father to Tess, it will make her vulnerable and allow Caleb to get to Olivia. Going along with this, Kevin visits Tess, referring to himself as her father. Elizabeth invites herself along on Alison's trip. Alison discourages this until she realizes how miserable her mother is. When Caleb comes home, he encourages his bride to go if that's what she wants. Angry, Alison lays into him and accidentally calls him \"Caleb.\" He catches this and asks for an explanation."

        "Rafe: All right, I'm walking over there now. You inside?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Hang on. There -- it's on.",
        "Alison: Ok. Can you see me? Can you?",
        "Rafe: Perfectly.",
        "Alison: Ok. Ok. I'm going to start looking around, ok?",
        "Rafe: Alison, just be careful. God, you're beautiful. You know that?",
        "Alison: Rafe, please, don't -- don't say anything like that, ok? Not until we know for sure that --",
        "Rafe: Hey, we're not. We're not brother and sister. Know that. I just -- I -- I can't take being away from you. I miss you so much.",
        "Alison: I know. I know. Me, too. So -- so just let me start looking around, ok? There's got to be something around here that ties Caleb to all of this.",
        "Rafe: Ok, but whatever it is, it's just -- it's not going to be obvious. Caleb's too smart for that. The best we can hope for is just some kind of clue that tells us what he was doing and where he was before he came to Port Charles.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Alison: Wait. Wait a second, Rafe. I found something.",
        "Rafe: What? What -- what is it?",
        "Alison: It's some kind of police report. Rafe, I think I may have found something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hello, wife.",
        "Tess: Hello, husband.",
        "Jack: Well, you happy?",
        "Tess: Very happy. This is right, Jack. Marrying you is right. I just -- I don't want you to worry. I heard you up last night.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, I thought I heard something.",
        "Tess: And?",
        "Jack: And it was just the wind. But so long as Caleb's out there, I'm going to be sleeping with one eye open. Especially once he finds out that we're married.",
        "Tess: He already knows. I told him.",
        "Jack: What? You -- you saw him?",
        "Tess: Yeah. Last night when he was here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Hi ya, Doc.",
        "Kevin: How the hell did you get in here?",
        "Caleb: Just returning the favor. Or did you forget that you broke into my place and threatened to blow me to kingdom come? By the way, you left this behind.",
        "Kevin: Get out.",
        "Caleb: Don't you want to know why I'm here?",
        "Kevin: I'm not interested.",
        "Caleb: Ok. How's your daughter been?",
        "Kevin: Livvie's gone.",
        "Caleb: You think she's dead, don't you? Don't ask me how I know. I know. And to answer your next question, no, I didn't have anything to do with her disappearance.",
        "Kevin: Go on.",
        "Caleb: Olivia's very much alive. As a matter of fact, I know exactly where she is. And you're going to help me get her back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I knew it. I knew it.",
        "Tess: Don't be mad.",
        "Jack: No, no -- it's last night. One of Caleb's band members pretended she had an accident. And I thought she was stalling me, so that's why I rushed back here so fast. Tess, why didn't you tell me that Caleb was here?",
        "Tess: I didn't want to spoil our wedding.",
        "Jack: No. What did he do to you? What kind of game was he -- was he trying to play with you?",
        "Tess: He tried to sing to me, but I wouldn't let him.",
        "Jack: And that's it?",
        "Tess: He didn't hurt me.",
        "Jack: Oh, no, Tess, listen to me, you don't know Caleb. All right? He's like nobody else. He puts people under these spells and does his thing, and then, before they know it, they're doing what he asked them to do.",
        "Tess: But I stopped him.",
        "Jack: No. Listen to me -- Livvie tried to stop him, and she didn't. She tried to change him, and she didn't. Tess, Caleb changed her. He turned her into a vampire. And I will die before I let that happen to you.",
        "Tess: Jack, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you upset. Please don't be mad at me.",
        "Jack: No, no, I'm not mad. I'm not mad and I'm not upset. But you have to promise me -- promise me that you'll stay away from him.",
        "Tess: Ok. I promise.",
        "Jack: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What is it? What'd you find?",
        "Alison: It's a -- it's a police report. It's the one from my father's boating accident.",
        "Rafe: What's Caleb doing with it?",
        "Alison: I have no idea. And there's more. Remember all those police reports that we read after he died?",
        "Rafe: Sure, yeah. They -- they talked about how he fell off the yacht and the search and how your mother was the only one questioned.",
        "Alison: No, correction -- she was the only one they found to question.",
        "Rafe: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: Well, I guess there was another person on this yacht -- some prince or something.",
        "Rafe: Go on.",
        "Alison: Well, I guess he was on the yacht that my father chartered. But then after he died, the police -- they went looking for this guy to question him, but they -- they turned up with nothing.",
        "Rafe: How hard can it be to track down a prince?",
        "Alison: Well, apparently, in this case, it was impossible. The guy turned out to be a phony.",
        "Rafe: Who conveniently disappeared after your dad's death?",
        "Alison: What do you think all of this means? Rafe, do you think that Caleb killed my father?",
        "Rafe: I don't know, but there's only one way to find out. I got to go to Capri where he died and look around.",
        "Alison: Correction -- we will go to Capri together.",
        "Rafe: No, Alison, I --",
        "Alison: Rafe, don't -- don't argue with me. If Caleb really did set all of this up, then I want to be there with you.",
        "Rafe: Ok. We have to be smart about this. We have to go separately.",
        "Alison: Ok. Ok, we will. But then once we're out of the country, then we'll be free to be together -- to -- to look around and everything.",
        "Rafe: Then maybe we can get the proof that we need so that we can be together for real. Forever.",
        "Alison: I think that I'm actually starting to believe that now.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rafe: Got to go.",
        "Rafe: Jack, what's up?",
        "Jack: Going to need your help, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Ok, shoot.",
        "Jack: Teach me how to be a vampire slayer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Oh -- sweetie, hi. I didn't expect to find you home.",
        "Alison: Um -- yeah, actually, I'm leaving, mother. I've decided to go on a trip.",
        "Elizabeth: A trip?",
        "Alison: Yeah. You know, with everything that's kind of gone on lately -- this whole mess with Rafe -- I think it would be a really good time for me to get away.",
        "Elizabeth: That's an excellent idea. Count me in.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Elizabeth: Wherever it is you're going, I'll go with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You're telling me that Livvie's not dead?",
        "Caleb: She's safe and sound.",
        "Kevin: I swear to God, if you're keeping her somewhere again, I will cut your heart out.",
        "Caleb: Oh. What's with all the hostility? And it's kind of stupid for someone like you to keep threatening someone like me. I may end up having a bad day.",
        "Kevin: Save it. Now, where are you keeping Livvie?",
        "Caleb: I'm not keeping her anywhere. She's with Tess.",
        "Kevin: I was just with Tess. Livvie wasn't with her.",
        "Caleb: She's not with Tess. She's inside her.",
        "Kevin: Inside her. Right.",
        "Caleb: You've heard something like this before?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, Tess mentioned some mumbo-jumbo about them merging, becoming one.",
        "Caleb: It's the truth.",
        "Kevin: Is that your humble opinion?",
        "Caleb: It's all fact. And I should know -- I created her.",
        "Kevin: What are you talking about?",
        "Caleb: Let me tell you a little story, Doc.",
        "Caleb: I separated the good from the bad, the weak from the strong. The result was Tess. The Olivia that was left behind operated solely on desire and her needs. The solution was perfect -- until the two reunited, two halves became whole again. But this time, Tess came out on top. She's not the one that I want, and I have a funny feeling she's not the one you want, either. Don't like to hurt me for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You want to go away with me?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, it'll be great. We'll have one of those mother-daughter kind of vacations.",
        "Alison: No, you can't come. I mean, this isn't the sort of trip that you would want to take. I'm going to Capri where Daddy disappeared.",
        "Elizabeth: Why would you want to go there?",
        "Alison: Well, I just --",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, you don't still think that I had something to do with his death, do you?",
        "Alison: No. No, it's not that at all. No, it's nothing like that. I just -- you know, Daddy's been on my mind a lot lately, and I thought maybe I could find some closure there. Plus, with everything that's going on with Rafe, I thought maybe this would be a good time to get away.",
        "Elizabeth: I understand.",
        "Alison: What is all this talk about wanting to take a trip? I mean, shouldn't you be wanting to spend some time with your new husband?",
        "Elizabeth: Husband? Oh, yeah, that's a good one. He doesn't even know I'm around anymore.",
        "Alison: Oh. I'm sorry.",
        "Elizabeth: So am I.",
        "Alison: Do you maybe want to talk about this?",
        "Elizabeth: I just -- I just feel like such a fool. I -- I was so certain that this time was really going to be different.",
        "Alison: No, actually, I think that you should come.",
        "Elizabeth: What? But you just said --",
        "Alison: No, I want you to come on this trip.",
        "Elizabeth: You're sure?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm positive. You know, if Stephen can't see what a terrific person you are, then you don't -- you don't need to be here with him.",
        "Elizabeth: I think you're right. I think this will be the absolute wake-up call that he needs.",
        "Alison: Yes, exactly.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. With me gone, he's going to get a taste of what it's like to actually miss me. And then he can obsess about that instead of his work and his women.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry -- his women?",
        "Elizabeth: Woman. This Olivia, some long lost love of his. Yeah. See, this will make him forget all about her. See, I was trying to think of some way that he would start paying attention to me again. This is perfect.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it's perfect.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, Rafe. What have I done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: So that's my story, Doc, and I'm sticking to it.",
        "Kevin: Why should I believe a word that comes out of your mouth?",
        "Caleb: Because it's all true. And I think deep down you know it.",
        "Kevin: Really? Think again.",
        "Caleb: Come on. You've seen what I can do. I came back from the dead. Think about it. Is it really that hard to believe that Tess and Olivia could merge as one?",
        "Kevin: And just who are you to play God with my daughter's life?",
        "Caleb: What's done is done.",
        "Kevin: That's your answer? That's it?",
        "Caleb: What do you want me to say? Tess was supposed to live out her days out in the woods, and Olivia and I were going to carve out this beautiful life together.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, until she figured out who you were and she killed you.",
        "Caleb: Olivia just got scared. Fortunately, in my world, dead doesn't always mean dead.",
        "Kevin: What do you want from me?",
        "Caleb: Your help. Tess is neither your daughter nor the woman I love, but she does have a certain strength I hadn't counted on. That's where you come in, Doc.",
        "Kevin: What do you expect me to do?",
        "Caleb: Simplest thing in the world, really - just be her father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, let me see if I heard you right. You want me to make you into a vampire slayer?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Right here, right now. Let's do it.",
        "Rafe: Ok. You're serious?",
        "Jack: Dead serious.",
        "Rafe: I don't want to be the one to disappoint you, but it doesn't exactly work that way.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Rafe: Well, you have to be born a slayer. And even then, it takes a long time. You have to hone your skills, learn your craft. I mean, it would take me years just to teach you the basics.",
        "Jack: Well, I can learn fast.",
        "Rafe: Ok, what's going on, Jack?",
        "Jack: It's Caleb. Rafe, he's obsessed with Tess. He came after her the other night at the docks, fangs and all. And then last night, he showed up at our house. He didn't hurt her, but I know he's up to something and I need to know how to protect her. And I need you to teach me how to go up against him.",
        "Rafe: Forget it. You are no match for the guy. You know how strong he is. This isn't a job for ordinary people.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm not exactly ordinary people.",
        "Rafe: Whoa!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Just what is my being a father to Tess supposed to accomplish?",
        "Caleb: It'll get your daughter back.",
        "Kevin: How?",
        "Caleb: Tess is wary of me. She knows I only want Olivia. You, on the other hand, can befriend her, get close to her, make her love you. More importantly, trust you.",
        "Kevin: All right, let's say that I'm even considering this. How does that solve your problem?",
        "Caleb: Just get Tess to let her guard down, to be vulnerable. I'll take care of the rest.",
        "Kevin: Just so we're on the same page, you want me to make nice to Tess in order to get my daughter back?",
        "Caleb: That's right.",
        "Kevin: So she can spend eternity with a vampire?",
        "Caleb: Or she'd be trapped inside Tess for the rest of her life and you'd never see her again.",
        "Kevin: Some choice.",
        "Caleb: Well, let me give you something else to think about. Besides you, the only other person who ever loved Olivia unconditionally was me, and I always will. Now, isn't that what every father wants for his daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok. So you got some strength, some skills. Doesn't make you a slayer, though.",
        "Jack: But it's a start, though, right?",
        "Rafe: All right, you know what? You got my attention. What, have you been working out? What?",
        "Jack: Actually, it's a courtesy of Caleb. Pretty ironic, huh?",
        "Rafe: I'm not sure I follow.",
        "Jack: Well, the first time Caleb was here, I was bit, and some of those same side effects are coming back.",
        "Rafe: Oh, boy.",
        "Jack: No, no, not the blood or the fangs or anything like that. It's the strength. Here. Look. I'll show you.",
        "Rafe: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you know, I just moved here. Thanks.",
        "Jack: Well, my strength's coming back, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I can see that.",
        "Jack: I have these skills and I need to know how to use them. And that's what I want you to do -- train me to fight Caleb. I know you want him gone as bad as I do. So let's do it together.",
