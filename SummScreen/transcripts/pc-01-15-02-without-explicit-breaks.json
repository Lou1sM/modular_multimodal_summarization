        "Livvie: So what do you think? ",
        "Jack: Hmm, i think they're great, but i need a little more syrup, sweet \r\nstuff. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, no, no, no. ",
        "Jack: Hey -- what are you doing? Give me that. ",
        "Livvie: Uh-huh. Say please. ",
        "Jack: Ok, your highness. Please. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, and you say \"pretty please.\" ",
        "Jack: Oh -- ",
        "livvie: On your knees. ",
        "Jack: Come on. ",
        "Livvie: Come on! ",
        "Jack: Give me the syrup. ",
        "Livvie: No, sorry. No syrup, then. ",
        "Jack: All right, well, we'll see about that. ",
        "Livvie: Say \"pretty please\" or -- no, jack, no! Ok, ok, ok, ok! I'm sorry. \r\nHere, you can have the syrup. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "jack: Too late -- go away! ",
        "Alison: Jack? ",
        "Jack: It's alison. ",
        "Livvie: It is ali, isn't it? ",
        "Alison: It's me, alison. Hi. ",
        "Livvie: Ali. What's wrong? ",
        "Alison: Can I stay with you for a little while? I just left jamal. ",
        "Ricky: Come on, man. Cuffs off. ",
        "Taggert: Hey, listen, when a guy gets brought in for shoplifting and tries to \r\nburthe place down so he can escape, I like to know where his hands are. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, besides, ricky, i thought you liked jewelry. ",
        "Ricky: Look, I already told you -- i didn't steal any jewelry or set any \r\nfires. It was all that bizarro girl. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah, casey's fault, right. ",
        "Taggert: You know what? Shut up, ricky, all right? Nobody's buying your story \r\nwith your record. I hope you had all the fun while you could. You're going away \r\nfor a long, long time, boy. ",
        "Casey: No way i'm not going to help. I don't care what they said. ",
        "Ricky: What are you doing? Are you crazy? ",
        "Casey: Help! Fire! You know what? Stay here and be a wuss if you want, but \r\ni'm getting the hell out. Fire! ",
        "Officer: What's going on? Hey! ",
        "Casey: Coming? ",
        "Paige: You're not going anywhere, casey. You're staying right where you are.\r\n",
        "Casey: Forget it, paige. You're not my mother. I can go anywhere I want \r\nwhenever i say so, and you can't stop me. ",
        "Amy: Wrong. ",
        "Paige: Yes, we can, casey. ",
        "Casey: I am not staying here, and believe me, you don't want me staying here, \r\nnot after i -- ",
        "paige: What? ",
        "Casey: I just can't stay here, ok? I got into some sort of trouble. ",
        "Amy: What now? ",
        "Paige: Come on, out with it. What happened? The short version, please. ",
        "Casey: Let's just say i ran into a little trouble with the cops. ",
        "Amy: How little? ",
        "Paige: Fix it. ",
        "Casey: How? ",
        "Paige: Look, I don't know and I don't care. Just do it, please. Do whatever \r\nyou have to do to take care of it. ",
        "Paige's voice: All of our futures depend on it. ",
        "Casey: Please. Who put her in charge anyway? All right, here goes nothing. \r\nOk, sipowicz. You're arresting the wrong perp, you geniuses. ",
        "Frank: Casey -- ",
        "ricky: See? What did i tell you? ",
        "Casey: I lit the fire, I snatched the jewelry. If you're going to arrest \r\nsomeone, try someone who's actually guilty for a change. ",
        "Amy: What? Oh. Stupid. God, not again. This ridiculous phony magnet thing \r\nkeeps falling off every time i -- paige was right, though. We can't take a \r\nchance. We can't let anybody see what our real watches look like. ",
        "Ian: Amy. ",
        "Amy: Ian. ",
        "Ian and amy: Hi. ",
        "Ian: How'd your date go last night? ",
        "Amy: Well, the big date was a big bust. ",
        "Ian: Ah. Well, I'm -- i'm sorry. ",
        "Amy: Oh, don't be. ",
        "Ian: No, I mean, I'm sorry about all the questions I was asking before you \r\nleft. Sometimes eve and me, we can -- ",
        "amy: No, just forget it. I am glad to hear things are going well between you \r\ntwo now. ",
        "Ian: Well, how would you know that -- ah. ",
        "Amy: Ah. ",
        "Ian: The sound of my voice, right? I got to stop being so surprised by what \r\nyou do and say and -- ",
        "victor: Ian. ",
        "Ian: Victor. What's that -- some serious equipment you got there. ",
        "Victor: We've got a serious mystery to solve. ",
        "Ian: A mystery? ",
        "Victor: You know that place in the woods where that mysterious light came \r\ndown new year's eve, scorched the ground, burned everything in a big circle? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about it? ",
        "Victor: The circle is now in full bloom. It looks like a tropical hothouse.\r\n",
        "Ian: That doesn't make any sense. ",
        "Victor: I've been telling you all along -- none of this makes any sense. We \r\nsomehow have to learn to think beyond sense. ",
        "Ian: All right. Why don't you sit down and explain it to me ",
        "victor: We, I will as soon as i stow this equipment it's very sensitive, \r\ndelicate machinery. Has to be -- very careful --carefully taken care of, \r\nespecially this -- the positron energy sensor. ",
        "Ian: Positron what? ",
        "Victor: Energy sensor. It's been calibrated to register the slightest -- ",
        "[positron beeps] ",
        "victor: The slightest wavelengths of -- whoa! ",
        "Amy: It's all right, I got it. ",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc., And soapnet] ",
        "alison: I'm sorry, you guys. I just -- I just didn't know where else to go.\r\n",
        "Livvie: No, it's ok. Sit down. Tell us what happened. ",
        "Alison: Well, it's really stupid. Ok, jamal got back from chicago and he was \r\njust -- he was just sitting there when it all happened. ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Alison: Rafe -- he was carrying me and -- ",
        "jack: Rafe? Rafe was doing what? ",
        "Alison: No -- yeah, and then we had this huge fight, ok? And then he tells me \r\nthat he gave up all of his rights to hope and then so we -- so we sort of made \r\nup, and then valerie, like, has this huge mental breakdown so he, like, brings \r\nher back to our place. ",
        "Livvie: Again? ",
        "Alison: Yes. And then, she, like, has this terrible dream or something, some \r\nnightmare, so he, like, puts her in our bed and then that was it. I can't take \r\nthat anymore, so i left. ",
        "Jack: Hey, alison? Alison, valerie's losing it. You can't expect jamal to \r\nthrow her out. ",
        "Alison: Well, I don't -- I don't expect it. I mean, I just expect him to take \r\nmy feelings into consideration, you know? ",
        "Jack: Well, hey, hey, you're acting like he chose her over you. ",
        "Alison: He did. You didn't see him when he was there. I mean, he just -- when \r\nshe woke up in this terrible nightmare, he just, like, ran to her like i wasn't \r\neven in the room! ",
        "Livvie: Ok, well, maybe he was just -- ",
        "alison: No -- ok, listen, you guys -- ",
        "livvie: No, ali, no -- no. ",
        "Alison: If you're going to take his side -- ",
        "jack: Hey, we're with you. ",
        "Livvie: Just tell us what you need. ",
        "Jack: Whatever you need. ",
        "Livvie: What can we do? ",
        "Alison: I just really need a place to stay until I figure out what i'm going \r\nto do, ok? But I don't -- i don't want to put you guys in the middle of \r\nanything, so -- ",
        "jack: No, no. Our couch is your couch. Ok? All right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, alison, whatever you need. I'll clear off some space in my \r\ncloset and -- ",
        "alison: Thank you. ",
        "Livvie: And you can put your stuff there and -- ",
        "[knock on door] ",
        "livvie: Can you get that? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Hey, you know what, alison? You probably just need a little \r\nspace, time for things to cool down, you know? Uh-oh. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jack: It's jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, anybody home? Jack? Hey. ",
        "Jack: What's up, dude? ",
        "Jamal: What's up, man? ",
        "Jack: What's up, man? ",
        "Jamal: What's happening? I'm good. ",
        "Jack: Good to see you. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Um -- I guess you know why i'm here, right? Ali, she's with \r\nlivvie? What, is she inside? Jack, come on. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Sort of. ",
        "Jamal: Well, come on. I need to see her, man. ",
        "Jack: Hey, jamal. Maybe -- maybe tomorrow, huh? I mean, she really doesn't \r\nwant to see you right now. ",
        "Taggert: So you're the evil mastermind, huh? ",
        "Frank: Where have you been? You were gone all night. ",
        "Ricky: Who the hell cares where she's been, just as long as she's here to \r\nconfess. ",
        "Taggert and frank: Shut up, ricky. ",
        "Casey: No, frank, he's -- he's telling the truth. I was lifting that necklace \r\nand he saw me and was trying to get me to bring it back and that's -- that's \r\nwhen we got busted. ",
        "Taggert: Mm-hmm. And you lit the fire, too, right? ",
        "Casey: Yeah. Dumb, right? ",
        "Frank: Hey, hey, hold on a second, taggert. If ricky is so clean, why'd he \r\nrun? If he really had nothing to hide -- ",
        "casey: It's because he was trying to help a real thick kid from racking up \r\neven more points, ok? Not that i gave the chump half a chance. I bopped him over \r\nthe head, took off as fast as I could, figured why not let him take the rap. ",
        "Taggert: Yeah, yeah, but your conscience was so guilty, you know, your feet \r\n-- they had a mind of their own and pitter-patter, here you are, right? ",
        "Casey: Yeah, so slap me on the wrist and let's call it a day, ok? ",
        "Taggert: Or maybe not or maybe no way in hell or maybe you could plead \r\ninsanity. Yeah, I'll testify to that. Nobody moves. Keep an eye on them, frank.\r\n",
        "Casey: Look, frank, you got to help me. ",
        "Frank: Help you how? ",
        "Casey: I don't know, but I can't spend the rest of my life in jail. ",
        "Frank: I don't know why this girl is taking the fall for you, man. ",
        "Ricky: Maybe I'm irresistible. ",
        "Casey: Or maybe not. Frank, please. ",
        "Frank: All right, i'll talk to him. All right? I'll see what I can do. ",
        "Casey: Thank you, frank. Thank you. ",
        "Ricky: Yes, thank you, frank. \"Thank you.\" ",
        "Casey: So, you're off the hook now. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, maybe. ",
        "Casey: Well, kissing one of my rings is the least you can do, don't you \r\nthink? ",
        "Ricky: What i'm thinking is why. ",
        "Casey: Because I felt like it. ",
        "Ricky: Try again, casey, because i know for a fact that when you left me out \r\nin the woods, there was no chance that you were coming back. So what gives, huh? \r\nWhat's the real reason why you gave it up? ",
        "[Positron beeps] ",
        "amy: What's happening? ",
        "Victor: All right, a right. ",
        "Ian: Victor, come on. ",
        "Victor: I'm trying to get the volume, but I can't -- I can't manage it -- and \r\n-- ah. ",
        "[Beeping stops] ",
        "victor: All right. Terribly sorry about that. It's all over. ",
        "Ian: It's a very delicate instrument you got there. ",
        "Victor: I'm afraid it's a bit temperamental, too, but it certainly served us \r\nvery well out in the woods. ",
        "Ian: What exactly did you find out there? ",
        "Victor: Frank and I went back to the exact spot where we found that -- that \r\nmysterious watch or whatever it was. ",
        "Ian: The one that's still missing? ",
        "Victor: Yeah, and as i told you, the brown circle of scorched earth is now \r\ngreen and lush. It looks like spring. And it's filled with flowers, a number of \r\nspecies of which i don't think I've seen before. ",
        "Ian: Did you take any samples? ",
        "Victor: Well, of course i did, but i don't think they're going to tell us \r\nanything because I think the evidence comes from another direction. Now, i know \r\nwhat this does to your scientific mind, but I think you have to at least admit \r\nthe possibility that some strange new source of life from another world may have \r\ncome to us, may even be walking around among us, even as we speak. ",
        "Ian: Aliens, is it? ",
        "Victor: Yes. ",
        "Amy: Well, maybe there are, ian. I mean, didn't you say there were lots of \r\nstrange goings-on happening around here this last year? ",
        "Victor: Finally. Thank you very much. Finally, someone who doesn't believe \r\nthat i've seen \"E.T.\" Too often. Thank you, amy. ",
        "Amy: Well, anything is possible. That's what makes life so fascinating. Now, \r\ni would love to hear more about this, but I have to get over to the clinic. ",
        "Victor: Let me move this out of your way -- whoop. Oop, hold it. ",
        "Amy: What? What's wrong? ",
        "Victor: Nobody move. Nobody move. ",
        "Amy: What? ",
        "Victor: Well, I turned down the volume, but -- but look at the gauge. ",
        "Amy: What about the gauge? ",
        "Victor: It's going berserk. ",
        "Ian: Well, why don't you follow it back to the source? ",
        "Victor: Well, that's difficult to do when the reading is so strong, but -- \r\nbut it's -- it's worth a try. Uh, uh -- let me see. Here we go, around here. No, \r\nno. No, nothing, nothing. Nothing. Yes, yes. Stronger, stronger. ",
        "[Positron beeps] ",
        "victor: Stronger. Holy -- ",
        "amy: What is happening? ",
        "Ian: Looks like you're the one setting off the machine. \u00e7 ",
        "Livvie: Jamal's not leaving. Ali, are you sure you just don't want to go out \r\nand talk to him? ",
        "Alison: No, no, no, not now. I don't want to see him. I can't face him. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, god, you're really that angry with him? ",
        "Alison: No, listen. I didn't tell you something before because jack was here, \r\nbut I kissed rafe again! ",
        "Livvie: Rafe? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: I thought rafe went back up to -- ",
        "alison: I know, I know, I know, I know. And that's why i didn't say anything \r\nis because jack was here and only you and I know that he's an angel. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, so how did he get to come back? ",
        "Alison: Well, it's sort of like a reward for doing good work, you know? It's \r\nhis one chance to live like us, like normal people without the powers -- you \r\nknow, at least, just for a little while anyway. And what do I do? As soon as he \r\ngets here, I, like, totally start crying on his shoulder about jamal and he's, \r\nlike, trying to make things better and -- and -- ",
        "livvie: And? ",
        "Alison: Ah. One thing sort of leads to another, and I -- i kind of came on to \r\nhim and I feel really bad about it! ",
        "Livvie: Ok, ok, wait a minute -- an innocent kiss. Ali, big deal. ",
        "Alison: No, no -- ",
        "livvie: You kissed him before. ",
        "Alison: No, no, no! It's not like the last time. And I only did it because I \r\nwas upset with jamal. But -- ",
        "livvie: Oh, no -- \"but\" what? ",
        "Alison: But I liked it! I did! And it wasn't like with jamal. And I don't \r\nknow. I don't know what to do because I have these feelings, right, and i'm \r\nstarting to, anyways, and i don't know what to do with them. I don't know, I \r\ndon't know, but the only thing that I do know is that i can't see jamal. Not \r\nnow. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, jack. Stop playing and let me in. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, jamal? What about tomorrow, huh? Let's just give it some time \r\nto cool down. ",
        "Jamal: We got to work this thing out now, ok? That means she has to be home \r\nwith me and nowhere else. ",
        "Jack: What about valerie? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I got my reasons for helping valerie, ok? That's got nothing to \r\ndo with my feelings for ali, jack. It doesn't, ok? ",
        "Jack: All right, all right. All right, i get it. It's really none of my \r\nbusiness anyway, but alison's a friend, too. And she asked us to keep you away. \r\nSo that's what i have to do. ",
        "Jamal: I'm not losing her, jack. ",
        "Jack: Look, jamal -- ",
        "jamal: Alison! Come on, just let me in, alison! Come on, just -- just come \r\ntalk to me, please? I just want to talk. Come on. ",
        "Casey: Look, I just got through telling them why i came back. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah. And now i'm asking. ",
        "Casey: Well, maybe I'm just a nice girl or maybe i had a visit from mother \r\nteresa. Hmm. ",
        "Ricky: Well, somebody made you come back here, and don't bother telling me no \r\nbecause we both know i'm right. ",
        "Casey: Look, I'm here, you're clear, ok? So just let it go. ",
        "Ricky: Thanks. ",
        "Casey: What? ",
        "Ricky: I said -- ",
        "frank: Ok, kids. ",
        "Casey: Finally. Well, frank, spill. What's up? ",
        "Frank: Well, I talked to the man. You're free to go. ",
        "Casey: All right! ",
        "Frank: But \"free\" doesn't always come free. There's a hitch and you're not \r\ngoing to like it. ",
        "[Positron beeps] ",
        "amy: It sounds to me like your machine needs some recalibration. ",
        "Victor: The machine is in perfectly good order. I think -- i think it's your \r\nwatch. ",
        "Amy: Well, what about it? ",
        "Victor: I think it's setting the machine off. ",
        "Amy: Well, I don't know why it should. It's just an average watch except with \r\nnumbers in braille, of course. ",
        "Ian: Of course. ",
        "Victor: But I did the calibrations myself. All I can say is that something \r\nover there is setting the machine off. ",
        "Ian: Do you still have the soil samples? ",
        "Victor: Of course I do. ",
        "Ian: Well, then why don't you reset the machine and test the soil and compare \r\nwhatever your readings are to that of amy's watch. ",
        "Victor: Well, that's a splendid idea. Do you mind? ",
        "Ian: Amy? ",
        "[Knocking on door] ",
        "jamal: Come on, spunky, just let me in, please. ",
        "Livvie: Do you want me to tell him to just -- ",
        "alison: Yeah. Yeah, please. Just tell him to go. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you're mad at me right now. I know that. ",
        "Alison: , Wait. Livvie, don'T. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you have every right to be. Ok, I know i really screwed up this \r\nthing with valerie. Ok, but there's one thing in my life that I know i did right \r\nand that's loving you, baby. Look, you're the only woman i ever really even \r\ncared about. I mean, you -- you're the one i want to be with, baby. The only \r\none. Look, you remember that whole thing with cedric -- when that whole thing \r\nwith cedric went down, and we went up to the cabin, you had that nightmare and \r\nyou -- and you grabbed me and you held me so tight and you wouldn't let go all \r\nnight long? I still remember that -- how that felt, like how there was nobody \r\nelse in the whole wide world that can make it better and turn that around. Ali, \r\ni still want to be that guy. Ok? But I need you, too. Ok, see, because it's my \r\nturn now. I'm caught in that same nightmare, ok, and i just need your arms, \r\nbaby. Please, just -- just come out here and talk to me, please. I love you so \r\nmuch. Just -- just talk to me, please. I've got nothing without you. ",
        "Casey: A hitch I'm not going to like? Well, there's a big whoop surprise. ",
        "Frank: I lied for you, casey. You owe me. ",
        "Casey: You did? ",
