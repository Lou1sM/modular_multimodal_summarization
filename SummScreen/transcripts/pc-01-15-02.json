", "Ian: The one that's still missing? ", "Victor: Yeah, and as i told you, the brown circle of scorched earth is now green and lush. It looks like spring. And it's filled with flowers, a number of species of which i don't think I've seen before. ", "Ian: Did you take any samples? ", "Victor: Well, of course i did, but i don't think they're going to tell us anything because I think the evidence comes from another direction. Now, i know what this does to your scientific mind, but I think you have to at least admit the possibility that some strange new source of life from another world may have come to us, may even be walking around among us, even as we speak.

I didn't tell you something before because jack was here, but I kissed rafe again! ", "Livvie: Rafe? ", "Alison: Yeah. ", "Livvie: I thought rafe went back up to -- ", "alison: I know, I know, I know, I know. And that's why i didn't say anything is because jack was here and only you and I know that he's an angel. ", "Livvie: Ok, so how did he get to come back? ", "Alison: Well, it's sort of like a reward for doing good work, you know? It's his one chance to live like us, like normal people without the powers -- you know, at least, just for a little while anyway. And what do I do? As soon as he gets here, I, like, totally start crying on his shoulder about jamal and he's, like, trying to make things better and -- and -- ", "livvie: And? ", "Alison: Ah. One thing sort of leads to another, and I -- i kind of came on to him and I feel really bad about it! ", "Livvie: Ok, ok, wait a minute -- an innocent kiss. Ali, big deal. ", "Alison: No, no -- ", "livvie: You kissed him before. ", "Alison: No, no, no! It's not like the last time. And I only did it because I was upset with jamal. But -- ", "livvie: Oh, no -- \"but\" what? ", "Alison: But I liked it! I did! And it wasn't like with jamal. And I don't know. I don't know what to do because I have these feelings, right, and i'm starting to, anyways, and i don't know what to do with them. I don't know, I don't know, but the only thing that I do know is that i can't see jamal. Not now. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Come on, jack. Stop playing and let me in. ", "Jack: Hey, hey, jamal? What about tomorrow, huh? Let's just give it some time to cool down. ", "Jamal: We got to work this thing out now, ok? That means she has to be home with me and nowhere else. ", "Jack: What about valerie? ", "Jamal: Look, I got my reasons for helping valerie, ok? That's got nothing to do with my feelings for ali, jack. It doesn't, ok? ", "Jack: All right, all right. All right, i get it. It's really none of my business anyway, but alison's a friend, too. And she asked us to keep you away. So that's what i have to do. ", "Jamal: I'm not losing her, jack.

", "Casey: Well, maybe I'm just a nice girl or maybe i had a visit from mother teresa. Hmm. ", "Ricky: Well, somebody made you come back here, and don't bother telling me no because we both know i'm right. ", "Casey: Look, I'm here, you're clear, ok? So just let it go. ", "Ricky: Thanks. ", "Casey: What? ", "Ricky: I said -- ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "frank: Ok, kids. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Casey: Finally. Well, frank, spill. What's up? ", "Frank: Well, I talked to the man. You're free to go. ", "Casey: All right! ", "Frank: But \"free\" doesn't always come free. There's a hitch and you're not going to like it. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Positron beeps] ", "amy: It sounds to me like your machine needs some recalibration. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Victor: The machine is in perfectly good order. I think -- i think it's your watch. ", "Amy: Well, what about it? ", "Victor: I think it's setting the machine off. ", "Amy: Well, I don't know why it should. It's just an average watch except with numbers in braille, of course. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Of course. ", "Victor: But I did the calibrations myself. All I can say is that something over there is setting the machine off. ", "Ian: Do you still have the soil samples? ", "Victor: Of course I do. ", "Ian: Well, then why don't you reset the machine and test the soil and compare whatever your readings are to that of amy's watch. ", "Victor: Well, that's a splendid idea. Do you mind?

I know that. ", "Alison: , Wait. Livvie, don'T. ", "Jamal: Look, you have every right to be. Ok, I know i really screwed up this thing with valerie. Ok, but there's one thing in my life that I know i did right and that's loving you, baby. Look, you're the only woman i ever really even cared about. I mean, you -- you're the one i want to be with, baby. The only one. Look, you remember that whole thing with cedric -- when that whole thing with cedric went down, and we went up to the cabin, you had that nightmare and you -- and you grabbed me and you held me so tight and you wouldn't let go all night long? I still remember that -- how that felt, like how there was nobody else in the whole wide world that can make it better and turn that around. Ali, i still want to be that guy. Ok? But I need you, too. Ok, see, because it's my turn now. I'm caught in that same nightmare, ok, and i just need your arms, baby. Please, just -- just come out here and talk to me, please. I love you so much. Just -- just talk to me, please. I've got nothing without you. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Casey: A hitch I'm not going to like? Well, there's a big whoop surprise. ", "Frank: I lied for you, casey. You owe me. ", "Casey: You did? ", "Frank: Ye. I looked taggert straight in theand convinced him you were confused, that you made a mistake. ", "Casey: And he bought that? ", "Frank: Are you kidding? I had to promise you'd stay in my custody, and i'd make sure that you kept out of trouble. ", "Casey: Oh, wait a minute. You elected yourself babysitter? Uh-uh, no way! Uh-uh. ", "Frank: Well, if you want to stay out of jail, you better find a way -- unless you want me to tell taggert that you would -- ", "casey: No! Ok. It's cool. Anything else? ", "Frank: Yeah. Since I am vouching for you, rule number one -- I don't want you anywhere near this clown. Understand? ", "Casey: Hey. It's no problem there. He's nothing to me. ", "Ricky: Yeah, and she's nothing but trouble. ", "Frank: Ok. Then let's get out of here. ", "Casey: Yeah, this place gives me the king of pops creeps. ", "Frank: Hey, hey. Out that door, out of trouble. You got it? ", "Casey: Right. ", "Frank: Ok. ", "Casey: Ok, daddy. ", "Casey: Here i come.
