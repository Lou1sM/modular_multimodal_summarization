        "Kevin: Do you think that Chris has jack?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, doc, I'd bet the farm on it. The question is, where?",
        "Livvie: Mom!",
        "Rachel: Oh.",
        "Livvie: God! I can't believe it. It's really you. You're here.",
        "Kevin: I'll tell you what -- turn to the right just a little bit. That's\r\ngood. Now tilt your head up slightly. I got to fix the light.",
        "Paige: Is everything all right?",
        "[Kevin sighs]",
        "Kevin: Not really, no.",
        "Paige: What's wrong?",
        "Kevin: Well, I know lucy went to a lot of trouble to set this place up and\r\nwe'll use it --",
        "Paige: But?",
        "Kevin: It just feels so much like a --",
        "Paige: A studio, hmm, yeah.",
        "Kevin: A studio. Yes. Formal.",
        "Paige: You know, we need something like the cafe Dupont on the seine. Do you\r\nremember sitting at that table outside overlooking the river?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, you thought i was mad at you.",
        "Paige: Well, you wouldn't bloody well talk to me. Just kept sketching\r\nfuriously in your sketch pad.",
        "Kevin: Until you demanded to know what i was so interested in. It was you.",
        "Paige: I still have that sketch. Something about Paris, huh?",
        "Kevin: You know what? I know a place. It's not exactly a cafe on the seine,\r\nbut I think it'll do.",
        "Paige: Lovely.",
        "Livvie: Ahem. Why don't we give you two a chance to talk?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you guys take as long as you need. Ok?",
        "Jamal: Is it ok if I come in?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Well, I mean, I guess that's a good sign, huh?",
        "Livvie: No, jack, this is all my fault.",
        "Jack: No, livvie, stop.",
        "Livvie: I brought Valerie back here, jack.",
        "Jack: You didn't know what you were doing.",
        "Livvie: But that's why Alison and Jamal are in this mess.",
        "Jack: Hey. It's going to be ok. All right? I think I've got a way we can make\r\nthis better for everyone.",
        "Livvie: How's that?",
        "Jack: I'll tell you on the way. Let's go.",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm -- i'm sorry i let things get the way they are, ali. But I'm\r\nglad you let me in so we can talk and, like, work this out.",
        "Alison: I'm not sure that we can, Jamal. Because our problems aren't just\r\nabout us anymore.",
        "Rafe: Ed? Hey! I don't belong here, all right? I mean, you know what? I know\r\ni asked for it, but I made a mistake. So don't let me stay here and keep messing\r\nthings up. Just -- just bring me back! Now would be good!",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine. You don't want to listen to me? That's fine. But just know\r\nthis -- things get worse, it's on your head, ok? So i hope you can sleep with\r\nthat, buddy.",
        "Ed: I was sleeping just fine. So unless you have a really good reason for\r\nwaking me up, heaven's the last place you're going.",
        "Ian: What are you doing?",
        "Amy: I thought victor's machine sounded interesting, so i was checking it\r\nout.",
        "Ian: Checking it out? You're taking it apart.",
        "Amy: Uh -- well, don't be ridiculous. This is how I see things, remember?",
        "Ian: Yeah, and I also remember how bothered you were when your watch was\r\nsetting it off.",
        "Amy: What are you saying, ian?",
        "Ian: I'm not saying anything. Just with all the weird things happening --\r\nscorched earth and the lights and your funny watch -- maybe --",
        "Amy: Well, what does it have to do with me?",
        "Ian: Nothing. But victor, he was talking about aliens --",
        "Amy: Oh, so now you think i'm an alien? What kind of lunatic are you?",
        "Ian: I didn't say i thought you were an alien. I just think that maybe there\r\nis something that you're hiding.",
        "Amy: What're you exactly suggesting that I'm hiding?",
        "Ian: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "Amy: I've actually shared quite a bit of myself, so do a background check if\r\nyou don't believe me.",
        "Ian: Well, that wouldn't explain why you took this thing apart.",
        "Amy: Well, for the last time, I'm blind. I see things with my hands. Now, if\r\nI -- if I broke this thing while touching it, I'll pay for it. But don't you\r\ndare accuse me of --",
        "ian: Calm down. Everything's all right.",
        "Amy: No, because I know what this is about. It's easier for you to believe\r\nthat i'm a liar -- even from another planet -- than to accept that i'm an\r\nindependent blind woman who can take care of herself.",
        "Ian: I'm not saying that at all. I'm --",
        "Amy: You have the same narrow-minded attitude as my parents, the attitude i\r\ncame here to get away from. Obviously I was wrong.",
        "Ian: Amy, please. Just relax, come here.",
        "Amy: Don't touch me.",
        "Kevin: What's going on?",
        "Amy: Don't ask me, I just beamed down to earth.",
        "Ian: I think she's overreacting a little bit.",
        "Kevin: Why don't we just calm down for a minute? Ian, do you mind if we get a\r\nbreath of air? There's something I wanted to talk to you about anyway.",
        "Ian: Fine.",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm sorry. I don't think you two have met.",
        "Paige: No, but I remember seeing you the last time we were here. My name's Paige.",
        "Amy: Amy.",
        "Paige: Nice to meet you.",
        "Kevin: We'll just be a minute.",
        "Paige: Yeah, take your time.",
        "Ian: Excuse me.",
        "Ian: I don't know what it is, but there's something strange about that Amy\r\ngirl.",
        "Paige: You're drawing way too much attention to yourself. Tone it down.",
        "Amy: I didn't have a choice. He was about to figure out that i'm not who I\r\nsay I am.",
        "Paige: Oh, so you thought a temper tantrum might help?",
        "Amy: I don't think I can keep this up.",
        "Paige: You have to.",
        "Amy: Sooner or later, someone is going to find out who we are, paige, and\r\nwhere we're really from. And then it'll be over for all of us.",
        "Jamal: I know that our problems go beyond us. I let Valerie become a third\r\nwheel in our relationship. And I promise that's got to stop. I know you're\r\nthinking that you probably -- you heard this all before and you're right. You're\r\nright. Ok, I let Valerie move back in. Ok, I keep -- I keep trying to help her\r\nand I keep letting her get in between us. I guess because I feel so guilty\r\nbecause she's hurting so bad over her baby. Look, but it's just gotten out of\r\ncontrol. Look, ali, I should've never made you feel like you don't come first\r\nwith me, ok, because you do. You mean everything to me. And when you walked out\r\non me, just the thought of it freaked me out. Nothing mattered more than getting\r\nover here and begging you to come back to me.",
        "Alison: But I --",
        "Jamal: Is that a yes?",
        "Alison: I really want it to be. But I need to be honest with you, too.",
        "Jamal: About?",
        "Alison: Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dragged you out of bed, but this is really\r\nimportant. You have to bring me back, ok?",
        "Ed: So?",
        "Rafe: Please, sir? Please. I mean, me being back here, it's not helping\r\nanybody like i thought it would. In fact, it's making things worse.",
        "Ed: Please. I know what's going on here.",
        "Rafe: You do?",
        "Ed: Yeah. Yeah, you're sweet on that girl.",
        "Rafe: Well, I --",
        "ed: You're falling for her more and more every day, it's getting too tough,\r\nand you want to bail.",
        "Rafe: Something like that.",
        "[Ed laughs]",
        "ed: Exactly like that. I saw the little make-out session in the park.",
        "Rafe: You saw that? That was amazing. I mean, no, it wasn't. I can explain.",
        "Ed: Look, this is your gig, remember? You sacrificed for it, so you got it.\r\nNow you go figure out what to do about it.",
        "Rafe: Well, that's just it. See, i -- I know what I came down here to do.",
        "Ed: What? Reunite Alison and Jamal?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I mean, that's what i intended, but now it's like all my feelings\r\nfor Alison are getting in the way, and instead of bringing them closer together,\r\nI'm just pulling them further apart.",
        "Ed: Tough being a regular human guy, huh?",
        "Rafe: Yes, it is impossible! I mean, at least when I was a guardian angel i\r\ncould fight my feelings or -- ok, I know i wasn't that good at it. But you know\r\nwhat? At least i had a fighting chance and -- and now it's like just my\r\nemotions, they completely just control me, you know, and I -- i can't stop them.",
        "Ed: Maybe you're not supposed to.",
        "ian: Has nothing to do with victor and that talk of aliens or that funny\r\nwatch. I just think there's something weird about her.",
        "Kevin: Something meaning what?",
        "Ian: I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out, so i need you to do me a\r\nfavor. Call that friend of yours at Berkeley, the one she studied under.",
        "Kevin: No.",
        "Ian: No, because what?",
        "Kevin: Because of what everyone went through. More to the point, what I put\r\nyou through. It's what I wanted to talk to you about. Caleb may have started the\r\nball rolling, but i picked it up and ran with it. I don't think I ever properly\r\napologized for that and I know it doesn't make up for anything, but i am truly\r\nsorry for what I did.",
        "Ian: Well, it's all behind us now.",
        "Kevin: I'm not so sure. We're all still on edge. It's for good reason, but if\r\nsomething happens out of the ordinary, we'll all go into a tailspin.",
        "Ian: So what are you suggesting?",
        "Kevin: I'm suggesting accepting things at face value and giving people what i\r\nnever gave you -- the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Paige: We don't have to worry about people carrying on if we're careful how\r\nwe deal with them.",
        "Amy: Don't talk to me like i'm Casey.",
        "Paige: Why not? You're acting like her -- the scene you were making.",
        "Amy: You have no idea the spot that I was in. My watch was setting this\r\nmachine off. I was about to get caught.",
        "Paige: That doesn't excuse your reaction.",
        "Amy: Don't lecture me. I got out of it, didn't I?",
        "Paige: I think you should move out of Ian and Eve's.",
        "Amy: What?",
        "Paige: You know what happens in the shower when our skin comes in contact\r\nwith hot water.",
        "Amy: Yeah, our skin disappears, but no one would know that unless -- unless\r\nsomeone was in the shower with me. What are you getting at?",
        "Paige: Look, you just got very carried away fighting with ian and --",
        "Amy: And what? My neck was on the line.",
        "Paige: Fine. But you said yourself that Ian's beginning to get suspicious. So\r\nliving there is a bad idea regardless.",
        "Amy: First you try to tell me how to act, and now you're trying to tell me\r\nwhere to live. Who appointed you leader?",
        "Paige: Somebody's got to take control here or we're done.",
        "Amy: And that somebody should be you?",
        "Paige: Considering your and Casey's behavior, hmm, yes.",
        "Amy: Stop comparing me to that delinquent!",
        "Kevin: Well, for two people who just met, you're certainly not holding\r\nanything back.",
        "Livvie: I hope this works.",
        "Jack: Yeah, me, too. Ooh.",
        "Valerie: Jamal?",
        "Livvie: Hi, Valerie.",
        "Valerie: Jamal isn't home.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, we actually came to see you.",
        "Jack: Can we come in?",
        "Livvie: So how are you doing?",
        "Valerie: Well, I don't think I'll ever really be able to get over losing\r\nhope. But Jamal's been so goodie me. I mean, he helps me get through every day.\r\nI don't know what I'd do without him.",
        "Jack: Right, right. Well, that's actually kind of why we came to see you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, we know you're going through a really tough time, but so are\r\njamal and Alison.",
        "Valerie: I know. I mean, I think Jamal said he was going to tell her they\r\nneed a little break.",
        "Jack: Actually, Jamal and Alison are trying to work things out.",
        "Valerie: They are?",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. And we wanted to know if you would like to come stay with\r\nus.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, just -- just until you're feeling better.",
        "Jack: And then Alison can move back in here where she belongs.",
        "Valerie: Thanks, but I can't. I mean, I barely know you guys.",
        "Livvie: Valerie, listen, it really wouldn't be any trouble. We really want\r\nyou to stay with us.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Valerie: I'll think about it.",
        "Livvie: Look, Val, i feel really, really bad for what happened to you. But\r\njamal and alison are our best friends and we don't want to see them go through\r\nany more trouble than they already have.",
        "Valerie: I said I'd think about it. Now, if you don't mind --",
        "livvie: Ok.",
        "Jack: It's good seeing you, too.",
        "Valerie: Sorry, honey, but Jamul's going back to Alison over my dead body.",
        "Livvie: That girl is so scary. Did you see her face when we said Jamal and Alison\r\nwere going to get back together?",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's all the more reason to get her out of here -- fast.",
        "Rafe: I hate not being in control of my emotions.",
        "Ed: I'm sorry about that, kid, but it's your journey.",
        "Rafe: Come on. I mean, you know what? I already learned my lesson, ok? So why\r\ncan't you just pull ahead and say, \"I told you so\" and bring me back\r\nup?",
        "Ed: It doesn't work that way.",
        "Rafe: Well, why not? I mean, you were right, ok? This is a lot harder than i\r\nthought it would be. I'm not going to be able to do what i set out to do, so\r\nwhat's the reason to keep me here? Come on. Please. Ok, i promise i will never\r\nask you for anything again! All right?",
        "Ed: I'm sorry, kid, a deal is a deal.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but I'm just trying --",
        "ed: And my suggestion is deal with it.",
        "Rafe: No, ed, you can't!",
        "Ah! Why would ed do that? Why would he just leave me down here when he knows\r\ni'm going to keep messing everything up? I mean, he had to know this would\r\nhappen, that I'd fall in love with Allison.",
        "Alison: Jamal, you've been so caught up with Valerie, and I've been spending\r\nso much more time with rafe.",
        "Jamal: I know, I know. That's because i've been shutting you out, ali. That's\r\nmy fault.",
        "Alison: But the thing is with me and rafe --",
        "Jamal: I don't -- I don't want to know about rafe because I know if I'd been\r\npaying more attention to us, then none of this would've happened. Ok, Valerie\r\nand rafe, they wouldn't be issues.",
        "Alison: But they are.",
        "Jamal: But they don't have to be. Look, I love you. And if i haven't been\r\nsaying it or acting like it, i never stopped loving you. I want you -- I want\r\nyou home where you belong, with me. )",
        "Experience the true",
        "intensity of color.",
        "Rafe: [As ed] it's your journey, you figure it out. Maybe you're not supposed\r\nto fight your feelings.",
        "[Normal voice] yeah, right. Then I'd never be able to do what i -- what i\r\ncame here to do. Wait a minute. What if that's not my journey. What if -- what\r\nif i wasn't let back to -- to actually help Alison and Jamal? Oh, my gosh, what\r\nif i was actually sent back here because -- well, yeah, it's -- it's like the\r\nstory I told Alison -- that i'm back here so i can have another chance to\r\nexperience life and -- yeah, because then there's got to be a reason for the\r\nfeelings that i'm having. It could be a good thing for both of us. Yes! That's\r\nit. That's it -- that's the real reason i was let back here. Or maybe not. No --\r\nno. I just got to go with it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to tell Allison how i feel.",
        "Jamal: I'm going to tell Valerie straight up she needs real help. And I can't\r\n-- i'm not the one to be taking care of her anymore.",
        "Alison: She's not going to like that, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Well, you know what? She's just going to have to deal with it. Ok? You\r\nknow, let's just -- let's just do this right now, ok? I can't wait any longer.",
        "Alison: No, I think that you need to do this by yourself.",
        "Jamal: You sure?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Ok. Well, give me about an hour and then meet me back at our place?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Jamal: Thank you, baby. I cannot wait to have you all to myself.",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Rafe: Hi. I really need to see you. I just -- I needed -- I needed to tell\r\nyou something. I'm sorry I had to track you down like this, but i just really\r\nhad to find you.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry -- do you want to come in?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, sure. Thanks. Um -- there are things -- I have just been thinking\r\na lot about you, and -- well, you know, the real reason I'm here, and suddenly\r\nit just, like -- it just hit me, you know, between the eyes.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm kind of glad you came by, too, because i need to tell you\r\nsomething.",
        "Rafe: You do?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I can't see you anymore, rafe.",
        "Jamal: Hey, Val, you home?",
        "Jamal: Oh, no, Val, what did you do?",
        "Paige: Amy and I were just discussing what it's like to be new here in town.\r\nYou know, first impressions and all and how you have to watch how you behave.",
        "Kevin: It seemed a bit more than a discussion.",
        "Paige: Yeah, well, with my big mouth, i made a comment about the argument\r\nthat we walked in on, and I'm afraid she took it the wrong way. It wasn't my\r\nplace to say anything, Amy. I'm sorry.",
        "Amy: It's ok. I overreacted.",
        "Ian: Well, if you can take another apology, i owe you one, as well. When this\r\nthing was sweet.",
        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" --",
        "Jamal: Valerie, how many did you take?",
        "Valerie: Enough.",
        "Jamal: Enough for what?",
        "Valerie: Enough to make you care about me.",
        "Paige: If they figure out what's going on, we'll have to leave here before we\r\nfinish what we came here to do."
