        "Livvie: God, what a perfect night. ",
        "Jack: Yep. Closed down every club in town. Not bad, not bad. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, let's do it again tomorrow. ",
        "Jack: Girl, you're full of surprises, aren't you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: Just how about no more surprises with Chris? ",
        "Livvie: I promise. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Livvie: And how can you and your brother be so different? ",
        "Jack: Well, actually, there's one thing we do agree on. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah? What's that? ",
        "Jack: That you're worth fighting for. ",

        "Ian: Here you go. ",
        "Arianna: Oh. I see. Thank you. ",
        "Ian: Do you know how to use one of those? ",
        "Arianna: I'm sure I can figure that out. ",
        "Ian: Because I have no problem taking you to the hospital if you'd rather \r\ndeal with a female doctor. ",
        "Arianna: Someone like Eve? ",
        "Ian: Eve -- Eve is a wonderful doctor, but I don't think we should involve \r\nher with this right now. ",
        "Arianna: I understand. It's ok. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Arianna: To talk about her if you want. You should see your face, how it \r\nlights up when you talk about Eve. Thank you. ",
        "",
        "[Footsteps] ",
        "Eve: Oh. Hey. Oh! ",
        "Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Eve: I thought I would make us breakfast this morning. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, I just wanted to get in a run, unless you want me to stick \r\naround? ",
        "Eve: No, no. Running is much better for you than my cooking, that's for sure. \r\nBesides, I actually thought you might want to sleep in this morning after last \r\nnight. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, we made a few memories there, didn't we? ",
        "Eve: Oh, last night was just -- ",
        "Kevin: Absolutely wonderful. ",
        "Eve: Like always. ",
        "Kevin: I'm glad you're home safe. ",
        "Eve: Me, too. Now you better get a move on before you're late for work. ",
        "Kevin: You're right. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. See you later. ",
        "Eve: See you. ",
        "Kevin: Bye. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, it's Kevin. I just wanted to check in, make sure you reached \r\nScott, cleared everything up with the police. Maybe I'll stop by your place on \r\nmy way to work. I'm a little worried about you. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Eve: Hello? ",
        "Lucy: Oh -- great, it's you. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, it's me, and I'm still not dead. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, listen, Eve, I am calling from jail. I really need to talk to \r\nKevin. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Well, I'm sorry. He can't come to the phone right now. ",
        "Lucy: He can't come to the phone, or you simply will not put him on?\r\n",
        "Eve: Both. I'm hanging up now. ",
        "Lucy: No, no! Eve, wait, please, please wait. Listen, this is my only one \r\nphone call, and I tried Scott, I couldn't get him, and Kevin is my only hope for \r\nmaking bail. ",
        "Eve: Well, I guess you're out of luck. ",
        "Lucy: Look, Eve, I know you are really, really, really mad about me for \r\nchanging those DNA results. ",
        "Eve: Well, Lucy, that just might be the understatement of the millennium. You \r\nlet my husband think I was dead, and then you jumped in to comfort him yourself.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Could we just save those insults for later, maybe? You know what? It is \r\nreally, really -- ugh -- dirty and scary in here. ",
        "Eve: Oh, Lucy, I'm so sorry. Jail is a place for people who've committed \r\nterrible crimes. Oh! Right. That would be you. ",
        "Lucy: Eve, stop it. I know you will not forgive me until hell freezes over, \r\nbut, please, just give Kevin the message before I'm out there working on the \r\nchain gang. ",
        "Eve: Oh, wait a minute. Just give me a minute to savor that image. Ok. Don't \r\nworry, Lucy. Someone will bail you out. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: The test is positive. Oh, this is a nightmare. This can't be \r\nhappening. ",
        "Ian: Usually women are a little happier when they find out they're having a \r\nbaby. ",
        "Arianna: When I used to think about having a child, I thought it'd be the \r\nhappiest day of my life. ",
        "Ian: Now, you said you'd trust me. Do you? Ok, then talk to me. Tell me the \r\nwhole story. Tell me about your supportive family. I've already met your \r\ncharming brother. Now, what about the rest of them? What about your father? ",
        "Arianna: I can't talk about my father. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: I can't help you if you won't talk to me. ",
        "Arianna: There are just certain things we don't talk about in my country. ",
        "Ian: I know, but this is America. Everybody talks about their problems \r\nwhether you ask them or not. Come on. Tell me about the father of the child. \r\nNow, is he someone that your family hates, or is he married, or is it someone \r\nthat your family likes and you don't like? Which is it? I'm just as stubborn as \r\nyou are. I can ask you questions all day, or you can tell me. ",
        "Arianna: No, you don't understand. You can't. ",
        "Ian: I know I don't understand, but maybe you can tell me the truth. ",
        "Arianna: I can't bring myself to say it. ",
        "Ian: Say what? Hey. Say what? ",
        "Arianna: Rape. I was raped. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Can anybody out there hear me in this godforsaken rat \r\nhole? I need help here. Whatever you served for breakfast, I couldn't even eat \r\nthat substance, and I just need some help. I didn't sleep a wink. Formal \r\ncomplaint! I'm lodging a formal complaint! ",
        "Officer: We hear you. They can hear you in the next county. ",
        "Lucy: Well, good. Well, why are you here? You're going to let me call my \r\nlawyer again? Is that it? Or, better yet, did Kevin come to save me? ",
        "Officer: You've been bailed out. ",
        "Lucy: I have? Oh, I have. Thank -- thank goodness. Here, this is for you. ",
        "Officer: We're not sorry to see you go. ",
        "Lucy: Well, let's go then. Let's go. Let's go, go, go. Ok. Thank you. Oh. Oh, \r\nDoc. Doc, I'm so glad you -- bailed me out. ",
        "Eve: Doc didn't bail you out, Lucy. Mrs. Doc did. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Raped? ",
        "Arianna: I never said that word to anyone before today, not even myself. ",
        "Ian: This isn't your fault. ",
        "Arianna: It doesn't matter. The shame of it is with me every minute of every \r\nday. And now it's with me for a lifetime. I've brought dishonor to my family.\r\n",
        "Ian: By what? By being a woman? By walking down the street? This is a violent \r\ncrime. How -- ",
        "Arianna: You heard my brother. I was headstrong, willful. If I would have \r\nstayed home that night, nothing would have happened. I put myself in a dangerous \r\nsituation. ",
        "Ian: Let me ask you something. Just you and me right now. Let me ask you a \r\nquestion. Do you think this was your fault? ",
        "Arianna: No. God, help me, I don't. You're the first person who ever said \r\nwhat I feel in my heart. And I did nothing wrong. Why has it been so hard to say \r\nit out loud? ",
        "Ian: Well, sometimes the things that are in your heart are the hardest things \r\nto say. ",
        "Arianna: How can my family love me and then turn away from me when I need \r\nthem most? ",
        "Ian: They shouldn't. Should not. ",
        "Arianna: In my country, it's always the woman's fault. I brought shame to \r\nthem, and I have to erase that shame with my life. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Arianna: They call it honor killing. You wouldn't understand. ",
        "Ian: No, I know exactly what it means. And there's nothing honorable about \r\nit. ",

        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Livvie: Wait, I think it might be room service. ",
        "Jack: Oh. Come back here, you sexy thing. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: Been a while since anyone called me that. ",
        "Jack: Oh. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, this is my dad, Kevin Collins, and, Dad, this is Jack. Jack is \r\n-- well, you know, my -- my -- my guy. Friend. My -- my guy friend. ",
        "Kevin: Looks like your dad was the last guy you wanted to see right about \r\nnow. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but -- yeah, yeah, there's nothing for you to worry about. \r\nNothing happened. See, Jack and I were out clubbing all night, celebrating his \r\ngetting sprung from jail. ",
        "Kevin: Jail? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Look, it's not as bad as it sounds. It was all a \r\nmisunderstanding. Right, Jack? Jack was set up. ",
        "Jack: That's exactly right, sir. And we just got back here a few minutes ago. \r\nWe were just, you know, relaxing. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Horizontally? ",
        "Jack: Um -- ",
        "Kevin: Actually, I was looking for Lucy, but since I've walked in on this, do \r\nyou think I could have a word in private? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: Oh. Yeah, sure. ",
        "Kevin: With you, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Uh -- yeah, sure. And we worried about jail. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I'm just going to -- I'm going to go change, yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Good idea. Why don't you slip into something warmer? ",
        "Jack: I agree. Sir, I can totally explain to you -- ",
        "Kevin: Livvie told me what happened. I believe her. She's a good kid. ",
        "Jack: The best. ",
        "Kevin: Have a seat, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Oh. No problem. This isn't going to be good, is it? ",
        "Kevin: I'll try and make it brief. I care about her very much. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I -- I do, too, sir, you know, in a totally respectful way. I got \r\nto be honest with you. I've never met anyone like your daughter. She's kind, \r\nshe's loyal, and she's not only beautiful on the outside, but she's beautiful on \r\nthe inside as well. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I have to admit we think alike when it comes to Livvie. I'm \r\npretty new to the father business, and Livvie is her own person, but I just want \r\nto be clear about one thing. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm listening. ",
        "Kevin: If you hurt my daughter, I'll come down on you like a tall building. \r\nFair enough? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: This is not even remotely funny. I don't need your money to bail me \r\nout. I'd rather stay here in this lovely jail. ",
        "Eve: No, I don't think you get it, Lucy. I wanted to bail you out because I'm \r\ntired of you going to my husband all the time like the helpless little victim \r\nthat you are and expecting him to come to your rescue. ",
        "Lucy: You know, I never really have to encourage him that much. ",
        "Eve: It's over, Lucy. Ok? You can fake my death and play all the little \r\ntricks you want to, but the fact is I am married to Kevin. ",
        "Lucy: You know, I would have thought your near-death experience, that little \r\nbrush with the car, might have improved your attitude, but I can see it hasn't. \r\nIt should, though, because I don't want you preaching to me about Kevin because \r\nyou couldn't even stay faithful to him for a year. ",
        "Eve: What are you babbling about? ",
        "Lucy: Everybody around here are not blind as bats. They could see what was \r\ngoing on with you and Ian even before you were kidnapped. ",
        "Eve: Oh, all right. Now, you're really reaching, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm not. I saw it. Eve, I did. I saw the little stolen looks you \r\nhad, you know, and all the computer capers and all those nights working and \r\nworking and working and working. ",
        "Eve: So we worked long hours. So what? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, but what about this whole kidnapping thing? You were alone \r\ntogether, right? Stuck in a room, night after night, day after day, just alone \r\nwith nothing to do but maybe stare at the walls or maybe you stared deeply into \r\nthose beautiful hazel eyes of Ian's, huh? Or maybe you were just kind of talking \r\nabout the weather or maybe the presidential elections. But I really believed, \r\nEve, something a lot more personal went on. ",
        "Eve: I don't have to listen to this. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, you do. You do -- because you can't keep stringing Kevin along \r\nlike this. You can't just have this fling with a gorgeous Irish doctor and come \r\nwaltzing back into poor Doc's life like nothing happened. ",
        "Eve: Nothing did happen. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, but listen. Deep down you know that there is this connection \r\nbetween Kevin and me, and even we can't seem to break it. ",
        "Eve: This isn't just about Kevin anymore, is it, Lucy? This is about winning \r\nand losing, and you can't stand the fact that you lost Kevin to me. Well, I \r\nintend to make him a very happy man! ",
        "Lucy: The only person that's going to lose in all this, Eve, is you. So \r\nplease, I want to give you the chance to come clean. I'm probably the only \r\nperson in the whole world you could tell me your true feelings, really, because \r\nwhether you want to believe it or not, we're actually in the same boat here. ",
        "Eve: We are nothing alike, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Eve, we are not with the people we are supposed to be with. Look, \r\nthe truth is, is you don't really want to be with Kevin, you don't want him, not \r\nanymore. ",
        "Eve: How do you know what I want, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Because if you really loved Kevin, if you really loved him with all \r\nyour heart, you'd let him go so he could be happy. And you know what would \r\nhappen is, in the process, you would find some happiness for yourself because \r\nyou would have Ian, and then, don't you see, we both -- we both would have our \r\ndocs. ",
        "Eve: Don't twist this around, Lucy, ok? I love my husband. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. If you want to go on believing that fairy tale, then go ahead. \r\nIt's not going to keep you warm at night. ",
        "Eve: I will go on believing that because I have a wonderful marriage and a \r\nwonderful life with Kevin. And if you think I'm going to let that go, then you \r\nneed to be in the psych ward, not the jail cell. ",

        "Jack: Bye. ",
        "Livvie: Bye. ",
        "Jack: Nice meeting you, sir. ",
        "Kevin: Same here. ",
        "Jack: Take care. ",
        "Livvie: You know, I've been wanting to introduce you to Jack for a while now.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, how'd I do? Was I dad-ish, firm without being too overbearing?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you were perfect. ",
        "Kevin: Look, just promise me that you won't get carried away. Don't let him \r\npush you into something that you're not ready for. ",
        "Livvie: Gosh, is this our first father-daughter sex talk? ",
        "Kevin: I guess it is. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Ooh, I wish I weren't so late for that. ",
        "Livvie: Can your daughter give you some advice or are there rules against \r\nthat? ",
        "Kevin: No. Advice cuts both ways. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. I'm really glad Eve is back safe and sound, but I think there's \r\nsome unfinished business between you and Lucy. Look, I see the way you guys are \r\ntogether, and if there ever were soul mates, it's you guys. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. I think that's enough father-daughter sharing for one day. But I \r\nactually was looking for her. Obviously, she's not here. ",
        "Livvie: Well, when I came in, I noticed her bed wasn't slept in. I don't even \r\nthink she came home last night. ",

        "Arianna: I've never met a man like you, a man who doesn't judge me. ",
        "Ian: I'm not in a position to judge anyone, believe me. ",
        "Arianna: In my country, my life would be over now. Maybe I should have stayed \r\nand faced my fate. ",
        "Ian: But you didn't. You ran and you were right to. How'd you get out anyway?\r\n",
        "Arianna: My sister helped me. ",
        "Ian: At least you've got one civilized person in your family. ",
        "Arianna: If my brother keeps his promise and tells them I'm dead, I'm going \r\nto have to spend the rest of my life in hiding. How will I raise this child \r\nalone? How can I protect us both? ",

        "Lucy: Eve is Doc's wife, and I am trying to respect his wishes. I should get \r\npoints for that. Ok, universe, you know, I bet you can see this already, but do \r\nyou see what's happening down here? We've got this real traffic jam happening on \r\nlove's highways and byways. I mean, we have Eve, who thinks Doc really loves \r\nher, and then we have Doc, who feels obligated to stay with Eve after everything \r\nshe's been through, and then we have Ian, who's some sort of wild card thrown \r\ninto the whole thing, and then you have yours truly, who Doc really loves. Wow. \r\nYou know what? I came this close -- I came this close to blurting it out, \r\ntelling Eve exactly what happened when she was coming back that night, that Doc \r\nand I were making love and we finally found each other again after all this \r\ntime. Boy, I love Doc. And he's mine. We were meant to be together. We just have \r\nsuch a connection, and it's always been there. Always has been, always will be.\r\n",
