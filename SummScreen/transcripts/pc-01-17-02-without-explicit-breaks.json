        "Casey: Oh, this is just ",
        "fascinating, frank. ",
        "Frank: Watch it, casey. My mom owns this place. ",
        "Casey: Ok, this whole thing sucks. ",
        "Frank: This isn't a party for me, either, but the cops agreed to put you into \r\nmy custody. So you're going to work in there and stay out of trouble. Get it?\r\n",
        "Casey: Hmm, designer duds -- looks like she's a really good tipper. ",
        "Frank: You won't be anywhere near the customers. I'm starting you out on \r\ngarbage detail. ",

        "Alison: Yeah. See, you know, jamal and i, we talked and we're going to try \r\nand work things out and, you know, just having you hang around and stuff, it \r\njust sort of complicates things. ",
        "Rafe: It complicates things, yeah. ",
        "Alison: And, you know, you're back on this earth to enjoy life, not to, like, \r\nget all messed up with my problems and stuff, so i really think that it's \r\nprobably the best for both of us. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, right. Well, you know, it's kind of funny because that -- that's \r\nwhat i was going to tell you. ",

        "Rafe: I wasn't hiding them. ",
        "Alison: Well, putting them behind your back sort of counts as hiding them.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Right. Well -- see, i was -- I was taking them somewhere. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Where? ",
        "Rafe: Um -- a date. Yeah. I have a date, you know. ",

        "Rafe: Who is she? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Your date. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, my date. She's a friend -- not mine, not yet anyway. Yeah, a \r\nfriend of lucy's and -- in fact, you know what? She's waiting, so I got to run, \r\nok? ",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sure that she'll think those flowers are really beautiful.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Right. You know what? Why don't you keep them? ",
        "Alison: No, I couldn't. ",
        "Rafe: Just a good-bye gift. Yeah, I -- because i'm -- I'm rethinking the \r\nwhole showing-up-with-flowers thing. I don't want to appear too eager. You know, \r\nbad form, so -- ",

        "Frank: Yeah, they're coming right up. ",
        "Gabriela: Ricky just started his job at general hospital. I'm taking him \r\ndinner. ",
        "Frank: So you can keep an eye on him? ",
        "Gabriela: Pretty obvious, huh? This is my brother's last chance to straighn \r\nup. ",
        "Frank: So let's remove any temptation. ",
        "Gabriela: Meaning casey? ",
        "Frank: Mm-hmm. Last time they hooked up, they landed in jail. ",
        "Gabriela: I don'think i could take another phone call like that. ",
        "Frank: So how are you feeling anyway? ",
        "Gabriela: I'm good. ",
        "Frank: Yeah? ",
        "Gabriela: No, the surgery was a breeze -- compared to dealing with my \r\nbrother. ",
        "Frank: Hey, you got ricky a job at g.H., I've got casey working here. As long \r\nas we keep them both busy and apart, they'll be ok. ",
        "Casey: Oh, no. Oh, what a time to get an itch on my nose. God, yuck! God, i \r\nhate my life! ",
        "Ricky: Long time no see, casey. So is this where you're hanging these days?\r\n",
        "Paige: Come on, quick. We have to get air on your arm and dry off the water.\r\n",
        "Amy: Right, you can't be walking around town with a disappearing limb. Is it \r\nstill -- ",
        "paige: Oh, no. It's back. It's back to normal. ",
        "Amy: Thanks for your help in there. ",
        "Paige: Yeah, well, I had to. I didn't want them figuring us out. ",
        "Amy: And here i thought you were worried about me. ",
        "Paige: Amy, look, i know I've been hard on you, but there is so much at stake \r\nhere. If they figure out what's going on, we'll have to leave here before we \r\nfinish what we came here to do. ",
        "\u00a0",
        "Amy: I don't know what i would've done if ian had spotted my disappearing \r\nlimb. ",
        "Paige: Yeah, he's been watching us like a hawk, which is never a good thing.\r\n",
        "Amy: I'll be more careful. ",
        "Paige: We all have to be -- you, me, and casey. One more careless move and \r\nit's over for all of us. ",
        "Amy: Casey's the one we've got to worry about. ",
        "Ricky: Just a tip -- the messy stuff belongs in the bag. What, are you \r\nworking here? ",
        "Casey: Jeez, get a clue, dude. I was just -- I'm just helping out a friend.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, that's not like you -- helping people. ",
        "Casey: Well, I don't need the money, right? I'm loaded, and my old man's rich \r\nas sin. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, right. That's why you were shoplifting? ",
        "Casey: Hey, a girl's got to have a hobby, right? Anyways, what are you doing \r\nall dressed up for? Somebody die? ",
        "Ricky: No. I just opened up a club down on the docks with a friend of mine \r\nand tonight is opening night. ",
        "Casey: For real? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, yeah. We got the hottest d.J.S mixing techno andip-hop. My people \r\nare handling the press. ",
        "Casey: You have people? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, yeah. Everybody wants to be part of this club. ",
        "Casey: Wow -- i mean, sounds interesting. Hey, maybe i'll go check it out.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Maybe I'll put your name on the guest list. ",
        "Amanda: Oh, there you are. ",
        "Ricky: Well, I'll see you around. Let's go. ",
        "Casey: One of your people? ",
        "Amanda: I'm heading over to the hospital now. Just park the car around front \r\nand wait for me there. Ricardo, did you hear me? ",
        "Ricky: Yes. ",
        "Amanda: Yes, what? ",
        "Ricky: Ma'am. ",
        "Casey: You are so busted, ricardo. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, drop dead, all right? ",
        "Casey: And you're her driver. That's why you got the new threads. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, I'm only doing it part-time, all right, between working \r\ndown at the club. ",
        "Casey: Club delusional. Nice try, hotshot. ",
        "Ricky: Well, it could be worse. I mean, I could be working down at the \r\nhospital cleaning bedpans like my sister would've wanted. ",
        "Casey: Oh, wow. Suddenly lugging trash doesn't seem so gross. ",
        "Ricky: All right, you know what? You've had your fun. Why are you looking at \r\nme like that? ",
        "Casey: Just thinking. I mean, despite your lame job and criminal tendencies, \r\nyou clean up pretty good. ",
        "Ricky: Which means? ",
        "Casey: Which only means you're not entirely repulsive, ok? ",
        "\u00a0",
        "Alison's voice: An angel, huh? ",
        "Rafe's voice: If you're looking for wings, forget it. We travel light these \r\ndays. ",
        "Alison's voice: Right. So, are you my own personal guardian angel? ",
        "Rafe's voice: Not exactly, but I wouldn't turn down the job. What's your \r\nfavorite flower? ",
        "Alison: Pink roses. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, you mean like this one? ",
        "Alison: Oh! That's so cool! No. It ends here. ",
        "Kevin: Jamal, ian's got everything under control. Don't worry. ",
        "Jamal: I just can't believe valerie would go thifar. I mean, I should've seen \r\nsomething like this coming. ",
        "Kevin: Look, I know what it's like to feel you have to save someone if you \r\nthink you've hurt them. ",
        "Amy: But the rest of valerie's life isn't your responsibility. You buy into \r\nthat, two lives go down the drain. ",
        "Ian: She'll be ok now. Got here just in time. ",
        "Kevin: Valerie, how many pills did you take? ",
        "Valerie: I wasn't exactly counting. ",
        "Amy: What were you doing, valerie? ",
        "Valerie: I wanted to die so i wouldn't have to hurt anymore. ",
        "Amy: Or so that jamal would rush by your side? ",
        "Valerie: What would you know anyway? ",
        "Amy: I know there's a difference between wanting to die and wanting \r\nattention. ",
        "Valerie: I just lost my daughter. Give me a break. Haven't you ever lost \r\nanything before? ",
        "Amy: My sight. And at first i wanted to die, but I decided to live. You have \r\na wonderful, produc ve life ahead of you if you just trust in yourself. ",
        "Valerie: You don't know what it's like to be all alone. ",
        "Amy: We've all been lonely and scared and so confused that giving up seems \r\nlike a blessing. ",
        "Valerie: But if only jamal -- ",
        "amy: Hey. Trust me. It's a big mistake to put yourself so totally in another \r\nperson's hands. ",
        "Valerie: Well, I'm fine now. ",
        "Ian: Well, let's take you to the hospital just to make sure, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, we're just going to keep you for about 72 hours for observation.\r\n",
        "Valerie: What do you mean \"observation\"? ",
        "Kevin: It's for your own safety. I'll check on you myself. ",
        "Valerie: Please come with me, jamal. ",
        "Jamal: You'll be ok. I mean, you're in good hands now. ",
        "Valerie: You're bailing on me? ",
        "Amy: You're going to have to start relying on yourself. Come on, honey, you \r\ncan do this. ",
        "Valerie: No, no. There's no way i'm leaving here without jamal. ",
        "Ian: Come on, let's go. ",
        "Kevin: Come on. ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "Valerie: No, don't let them do this, jamal! Please stop them. They'll listen \r\nto you. ",
        "Jamal: I cannot take care of you anymore, valerie. ",
        "Valerie: No. ",
        "Jamal: I'm sorry, it's over. ",
        "Valerie: No. It'll never be over! It's never going to be over. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, this is serious. Ok, you could've died. ",
        "Valerie: Would you have given a damn? ",
        "Jamal: Val, you know I'd hate to see anything happen to you. Ok -- you have \r\nso much to offer, but just -- just not for me. ",
        "Kevin: Valerie, listen to him. ",
        "Jamal: I love alison. I always have and I always will. And I am not going to \r\nlose her because -- ",
        "valerie: Because of what? Because of the child that we had together, jamal? \r\nBecause of me? So you're going to let them lock me up because I'm messing up ur \r\nperfect life? ",
        "Jamal: I am sorry for your pain and your loss, I am, and for your feelings \r\nfor me, but I can't help you. ",
        "Valerie: I should've expected this from the man who would turn his back on \r\nhis own child. This is what you wanted, isn't it, alison? Come on in, enjoy the \r\nshow. ",
        "Jamal: Don't lay this on alison. ",
        "Valerie: Meday I hope you feel half of what I'm feeling today -- empty, \r\nalone, desperate. ",
        "Kevin: Valerie, come on. It's time to go. ",
        "Valerie: It's not over, jamal. It'll never be over between us. Do you hear \r\nme? It's not over! ",
        "Ian: You were good with valerie, what you said. ",
        "Amy: Well, said all the right things, but whether or not she heard me is \r\nanother matter. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Well, I'm sorry about giving you the third degree earlier. It's a \r\nbad habit of mine. ",
        "Amy: You can't figure me out and that bugs you, doesn't it? ",
        "Ian: Don't do that. Don't analyze me, huh? Let me look at that burn mark. \r\nWhere is it? ",
        "Amy: Well, you know us aliens -- we heal fast. ",
        "Ian: Ok. I deserve that. Let me give you a ride home. ",
        "Amy: Thanks, but i'm not going to go home with you, ian. ",
        "Ian: Why's that? You got another date? ",
        "Amy: I really appreciate your hospitality, but I think it's time that i move \r\non. I'm meeting with a realtor about an apartment. ",
        "Ian: Ok. If you need any help, you let me know. ",
        "Amy: I'll just pick up my things later. I'm fine, really, and I do appreciate \r\nall that you and eve have done for me. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Amy: Ok? ",
        "Amy's voice: Thanks for your help in there. ",
        "Paige's voice: Yeah, well, I had to. I didn't want them figuring us out. ",
        "Amy's voice: And here i thought you were worried about me. ",
        "Paige: Amy, look, i know I've been hard on you, but there is so much at stake \r\nhere. If they figure out what's going on, we'll have to leave here before we \r\nfinish what we came here to do. ",
        "Amy: I can't afford to let you get too close, ian. It's too dangerous. ",
        "Paige: Amazing. Kevin's still got talent. I've got things back on track with \r\namy, we're both going to check on casey. I think everything's going to be all \r\nright. ",
        "Man: There you are, ms. Smith. I've been waiting for you. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, colleen? Hi. It's gabby. Could you tell ricky that I'm on my \r\nway? I see. Thank you. ",
        "Fran trouble? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, big surprise -- my brother didn't show ufor work. What is \r\nthat kid up to? ",
        "Ricky: Not repulsive, huh? Meaning that you like what you see? ",
        "Casey: Oh, don't get too excited. You know, I used to have this mutt who i \r\nalso thought wasn't repulsive. ",
        "Ricky: Oh. So i guess that means that you wouldn't want to take a little ride \r\nin the limo. ",
        "Casey: We can't hang together, man. Frank will flip out. ",
        "Ricky: See, iave a real problem doing what other people tell me to do. Didn't \r\nfigure you for the type to take orders, though. ",
        "Casey: Damn. ",
        "Ricky: What, is something wrong? ",
        "Ricky: Whoa. What was that about? I mean, I'm not objecting here, but did I \r\nmiss something? ",
        "Casey: Please, help me, ok? You got to get me out of here. ",
