        "Joshua is suspicious of Alison's motives in cozying up to him, but she appeals to his ego. From his hiding place, Rafe sees Joshua putting the moves on her, and the plane suddenly jerks, as if in turbulence. This wakens Elizabeth, who confronts Joshua about what he's doing with Alison. The pilot announces that they'll be landing soon, thanks to some tailwinds. This makes no sense to Joshua, who insists that there are no tailwinds and that they shouldn't be landing for another two hours. Convinced that something's up, he takes another look around. Instead of finding Rafe, he finds a beeping travel alarm. After they all retire to their respective hotel rooms, Alison is relieved to see that Rafe made it there safely. Meanwhile, Chris is confused about waking up in Ian's room. He insists that he heard Ian and Lucy talking about vampires, but they deny having any such conversation. Lucy manages to convince him that he passed out from drinking heavily, and an apologetic Chris goes h! ome to finish sleeping it off. Ian thanks Lucy for stopping him from feeding on Elizabeth, and Lucy lets it slip that what upset her was seeing him about to make love to another woman. She tries to take it back, but it's too late. Lucy and Ian kiss. At the lighthouse, Kevin is displeased to see that Tess brought Jack with her, but Jack informs him that he isn't staying for dinner. Instead, he'll be waiting outside in case Tess needs him, because he absolutely doesn't trust Kevin. Alone with Kevin, Tess falls victim to hypnosis. Kevin is furious when Caleb appears and takes her away. Hearing Kevin's shout, Jack rushes in, then accuses Kevin of selling his own daughter out to a vampire. Caleb carries Tess to the woods, where it all began. He sings \"Surrender\" for his Olivia, and when the young woman opens her eyes, that's exactly who she is. Caleb and Livvie kiss passionately.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Maybe we should go back inside and have a little talk, and get to know each other, just like you were -- just like you were saying. Would you like that?",
        "Joshua: What changed your mind?",
        "Alison: I don't know. You just -- you're so mysterious. I kind of like that. Come on.",
        "Joshua: What a change of heart. And so sudden.",
        "Alison: Well, you know, I just -- I kind of saw how you sprung out of your seat like that. I'm sure it was just something that flew out of a suitcase. You know, it's probably just something of mine, actually, but you were really trying to protect me and to be there for me. And I have a really -- I need that right now. I need that more than you know.",

        "Ian: Right.",
        "Chris: I did?",

        "Joshua: Perhaps you've had a little too much to drink again.",
        "Elizabeth: Perhaps it was bad champagne.",
        "Joshua: You know, even the best champagne is supposed to be sipped, not gulped like it was in a bucket.",
        "Elizabeth: May I have a word with you? Never -- and I mean never underestimate what a mother might do to protect her child.",
        "Pilot: Excuse me, folks. Just to let you know, thanks to some fortunate tailwinds, we'll be landing earlier than anticipated. Please take your seats.",
        "Joshua: Landing? No, that's impossible. We have two hours left before we arrive at the island.",
        "Alison: Well, you heard him. The tailwinds, so --",

        "Kevin: It's Austrian crystal. Oh, let me show you something.",
        "Tess: It's beautiful.",
        "Kevin: Look what it does in the light. See the changes in the patterns and the colors? It's like looking into a kaleidoscope. Livvie loved this. She just loved looking at all the colors and the changes. She said it made her feel at peace, rested, quiet. She said all she wanted to do was lose herself in the rainbows. Just keep listening to my voice. It'll help you feel everything that you've ever wanted to feel. Just trust me, Tess. Trust me.",

        "Elizabeth: Yes. What -- did he do something to you? Did Joshua do something?",
        "Alison: No. No, no, no. No, it's nothing like that at all. I'm just a little, you know, anxious about this trip and everything.",

        "Alison: Do you?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, me, too. Alison, I'm going to be going to the place where your father died, where the police actually thought that I killed him. I -- this is not going to be an easy trip for either one of us.",
        "Alison: Right. I'm sure it's not.",
        "Joshua: I take it this belongs to you.",
        "Alison: Yes. This is my travel alarm clock. Mu have fallen out of my bag or something. Thank you so much.",
        "Joshua: Yes, it fell out of your bag. I think you should be more careful the next time you pack. You don't want to lose something that might be important to you.",

        "Lucy: Why? Just try. Drink some --",
        "Ian: I can't! I can't live like that. I can't breathe. I can't think. I can't focus. I can't do anything.",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. But you don't have to be this uncomfortable. I mean, let me at least try to cool you off, ok? Let me just try.",
        "Ian: Yeah? Well, that's not going to do it.",
        "Lucy: You know what? We don't know that. I'm going to try. Come sit down. Come on. Sit. Sit down. Here. There. Is it helping at all?",
        "Ian: Yeah, that feels good.",

        "Ian: I -- I never got to thank you.",
        "Lucy: Thank me for what?",
        "Ian: For saving me. I -- I was about to feed on Elizabeth.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you were, but you didn't.",
        "Ian: Because of you.",
        "Lucy: I understood, you know, why you were about to do that. I understood that.",
        "Ian: Yeah. But I remember the look in your eyes. I can't get it out of my head. It haunts me.",
        "Lucy: Well, see -- it wasn't -- it wasn't about the fact of biting her and those fangs or anything. You know what? I think what really bothered me about the --",
        "Ian: What?",

        "Elizabeth: I don't think that will be necessary. Good night.",
