        "Lucy: So, how long have you been standing there? ",
        "Kevin: Long enough. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, I guess it's not the first time exactly that you've \r\nheard me talking to myself. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you weren't exactly talking to yourself, were you? ",
        "Lucy: I -- I don't see anybody else in the room. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- ",
        "Lucy: I see you. Ok, I -- I guess I was just sort of venting a little. ",
        "Kevin: Venting to? ",
        "Lucy: Maybe it was all the things I'd like to be able to say to Eve -- \r\nalthough I wouldn't do that, Doc. I would never put you in that sort of \r\nposition. ",
        "Kevin: Are you sure? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I'm very sure. But I have to admit, I did almost come this close \r\nto bursting her little bubble about, you know, what happened between the two of \r\nus because she waltzed in here so proud that she bailed me out. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Eve bailed you out? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, apparently so you wouldn't come to my rescue. And also so she \r\ncould poke me like a pi\u00f1ata about how I -- I shouldn't want to still be a part \r\nof your life. ",
        "Kevin: Why didn't you call Scott? ",
        "Lucy: I did. He was out of town. And, Doc, after one night in that ridiculous \r\njail cell, by this morning, you know, I tried him again and he wasn't there, so \r\nI had -- ",
        "Kevin: So you called me. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Isn't that what you're supposed to do when you're in trouble, \r\ncall your very best friend? It's just I couldn't exactly get past your head of \r\nsecurity. ",
        "Kevin: Sorry I wasn't there. ",
        "Lucy: Me, too, Doc. I'm sorry you weren't there, and I'm sorry for all of \r\nthis. But you know what I think I'm most sorry for is that I have to keep doing \r\nthis. I have to keep saying \"I'm sorry.\" Well, I'm tired of it! I'm tired of \r\nsaying it! I don't want to say it anymore! ",

        "Frank: Deneice -- ",
        "Deneice: Oh, hey, the rumors are true. You clean up pretty good. ",
        "Frank: Thanks -- I think. Hey, you haven't seen Emilio, have you? ",
        "Deneice: Yeah, and he just left what you left in the glove compartment of \r\nyour rig -- again. ",
        "Frank: Thanks -- again. ",
        "Deneice: Well, so, who's the lucky lady? ",
        "Frank: There's no lady. I'm just hooking up with some guys at the firehouse \r\nfor a round of poker. ",

        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Joe: Hey, I just ran into that girl on her way into Neumann's office. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, what girl would that be? ",
        "Joe: You know, your friend, the one Frank tells me is our new roommate. ",
        "Ian: Arianna. ",
        "Joe: Yeah. So, what's going on? I'm not used to living under the same roof \r\nwith someone I haven't even met. ",
        "Ian: Well, you'll meet her, don't worry. It's only temporary. And there's \r\nnothing going on there, either. ",
        "Joe: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Won't be a bother, is it? Because it won't be for long. ",
        "Joe: No. No bother at all. Not with me. But does Eve know that the woman who \r\nran her over is going to be staying with you? ",

        "Eve: Oh -- I got bad timing, I guess. You're obviously going out. I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Karen: Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly. He's not due for another half-hour.\r\n",
        "Eve: Who's he? ",
        "Karen: You know what? Let's not talk about it right now. Will you just come \r\non in? What's going on? You look upset. Is everything all right? What happened?\r\n",
        "Eve: This. ",
        "Karen: This looks like one of those African bracelets that Ian always wears.\r\n",
        "Eve: It is. ",
        "Karen: Where'd you find it? ",
        "Eve: The police gave it to me. ",
        "Karen: The police? ",
        "Eve: Apparently I was wearing it the night of the accident. And I don't know \r\nwhy. ",
        "Karen: Ok, did Ian maybe give it to you? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know. I can't remember, Karen.\r\n",
        "Karen: All right, all right. Calm down. ",
        "Eve: How can I? This whole week I've been trying so hard to make things work \r\nwith Kevin. We even made love. And I pushed everything else out of my head. But \r\nit keeps coming back. It keeps coming back. Karen, I need answers. And if I \r\ndon't get answers soon, I think I'm going to lose my mind. ",

        "Lucy: So Eve never really told you that I called you? ",
        "Kevin: She left a note that she had to run an errand. ",
        "Lucy: Never mentioning that I was the errand? ",
        "Officer: Lucy Coe. ",
        "Lucy: That's me. Here, present, accounted for. ",
        "Officer: I'd kind of watch your step from here on in if I were you, but \r\nyou're free to go. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: Excuse me, officer. My wife posted bail for Ms. Coe. Is she still in \r\nthe station? ",
        "Officer: No, she took off the minute she finished signing the papers. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, great, so you are free, too. You can go run after Eve and track her \r\ndown. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I'm not going anywhere until I find out how you wound up in \r\njail. ",
        "Lucy: I guess I'm just a very talented woman. ",
        "Kevin: All Garcia wanted was to ask some questions about the DNA test. What \r\nhappened? Were you charged? ",
        "Lucy: Well -- ",
        "Scott: Yes, she's been charged -- with obnoxiousness in the first degree. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. Oh, boy, boy, boy. ",
        "Scott: Why is it every time I come back from being out of town you're in a \r\nbigger mess than when I left? ",
        "Kevin: Well, I hear she's a talented woman. ",
        "Scott: I'm a talented attorney, but there's only so much I can do. We've got \r\nthe little DNA switcheroo, not to mention assaulting a police officer. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I see. So, what are you saying? You're not a talented attorney? \r\nYou're not talented enough so you can't help me out here? Is that it? ",
        "Scott: What I'm saying -- ",
        "Lucy: You know what? I can't hear what you're saying right now. I just spent \r\nthe night in a cell and I want to get out of here, so I don't want to hear what \r\nyou have to say right now. Do you understand? ",
        "Scott: Yes, but -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Just stop. Let me put it this way. The only sound I want to hear \r\nis the sound of a little water trickling out of my nice, clean tub's faucet in my \r\nnice, clean hotel room. And if you want to bawl me out and tell me everything I \r\ndid wrong, then do it later. ",
        "Scott: Well, I would, but -- ",
        "Lucy: No. Pal, tomorrow. ",

        "Kevin: Don't blame her for this, Scott. I think it's as much my fault she got \r\ninto this mess as anything. ",

        "Ian: What are you trying to say to me, Joe? ",
        "Joe: I'm not saying anything. I'm only asking. ",
        "Ian: And I'm telling you, whatever Eve knows or doesn't know about Arianna is \r\nnone of your business. Is that clear? ",
        "Joe: Crystal. ",
        "Ian: Good. And if you have a problem with me helping Arianna, you let me \r\nknow, won't you? ",
        "Joe: Has anybody ever told you you got a lousy personality? ",
        "Ian: Sure, all the time. Sorry. ",
        "Joe: That's all right. Forget it. ",
        "Ian: Kevin and Eve are renewing their wedding vows, and, well, she made it \r\nperfectly clear that whatever happened those two weeks, that's gone. She doesn't \r\nwant to know about it. Maybe it's for the better. ",
        "Joe: Maybe. Maybe not. ",
        "Ian: Meaning what? ",
        "Joe: Meaning what do you want, Ian? ",

        "Karen: Well, at least half. ",
        "Eve: I'm serious. I've been trying so hard to make things work with Kevin, \r\nyou know? Just the tiniest thought of Ian, I just push it right out of my mind.\r\n",
        "Karen: But? ",
        "Eve: But the other night when I was going into the lighthouse, there he was \r\n-- Ian. And I just fainted right into his arms. That's how much this is \r\naffecting me. And now this. ",
        "Karen: Well, what about it? ",
        "Eve: When I got this, I had this memory or fantasy or whatever, like this \r\nmovie playing in my head. ",
        "Karen: About him giving you the bracelet? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. It was Christmas. And we danced. And it was so romantic. ",
        "Karen: Only you don't know if it really happened. ",
        "Eve: Something happened. I just don't know -- ",
        "Karen: You don't know what? ",
        "Eve: I don't -- Karen, ok, you know, I need answers. I need answers. The only \r\nway I'm going to get Ian out of my mind is to find out the truth. ",
        "Karen: Fine. Only where do you look for it? ",
        "Eve: The only place I can -- where it all happened -- or didn't. I'm going \r\nback to where Harris kept us captive. ",

        "Karen: Well, I'll postpone them. Look, Eve, you've always stuck by me, no \r\nmatter what I was going through, and I've been through a lot. So don't ask me \r\nnot to be there for you when you need me. Besides, he'll understand. ",

        "Kevin: Scott, I have tried to let her know. ",
        "Scott: But not enough, you know? I mean, all of a sudden things happen and \r\nshe gets involved in your life. And you know she's addicted to you. ",
        "Kevin: All right, look, Scott -- ",
        "Scott: No, I'm serious. She's like a junkie here. You know, you got to stop \r\nher. You got to just tell her that it's never going to work, and you got to \r\nreally mean it. Otherwise it's not going to happen. ",
        "Kevin: Listen, if you know anything about me, it's that you know that I would \r\nnever deliberately hurt Lucy. ",
        "Scott: I'm not saying that it's deliberate, you know. I'm just as guilty as \r\nyou are, you know. I've done the same things. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Scott: Yes. Yes, I have, and I didn't mean to do it, nor do you. But the \r\ntrouble with Lucy is that she just keeps coming back and then she just stands \r\nthere and she takes it from both of us. It's like -- ",
        "Lucy: Like the helpless little victim that I am? Is that it?",
        "Scott: Hiya, Lucy. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, he's right. I'm sending you mixed signals, and I have to stop.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Like hell you are, Doc. I pick up on your signals. I read them loud and \r\nclear. You want me and I want you. But by the way, I am not a victim. Not \r\nanybody's victim. ",
        "Kevin: But I -- ",
        "Lucy: Not anybody's. But I understand the message you're trying to get to me, \r\nok? And as for you -- ",

        "Scott: But, you know, I tend to -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no. No, listen to me. I don't want either one of your help. Do you \r\nunderstand? I don't want either one of you feeling sorry for me, either. Because \r\nwhile I was out there, I had this very interesting thing going on inside of my \r\nhead while you two were in here feeling sorry for me. I had an epiphany. ",
        "Scott: Huh? ",
        "Lucy: I had a light bulb go off in my head, a great big, fat one that said, \r\n\"Lucy, you don't need these two. You don't need either one of them.\" And I \r\ncertainly do not need any of this. ",
        "Kevin: Listen, Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, I don't want to listen, Doc, anymore. I'm tired of listening. I \r\nwant both of you to listen to me, ok? If you want to go off and you want to be \r\nwith Eve, that's your choice. Then, by all means, you go and do that. And, you, \r\nlisten to me. If this is it, if you really want to start your whole life over, \r\nif you want to go rekindle something with Laura, then by all means go out and do \r\nit because I am done. I am done sitting around like a poor little victim, \r\nsitting here waiting for happiness to fall out of the sky and just find me \r\nsomehow. I'm going to go out and find my own happiness. I'm going to make my own \r\ndecisions, I'm going to choose my own choices, and I am going to get the \r\nhappiness that I deserve because I am Lucy Coe and I deserve great, great deals \r\nof happiness. And so I'm not going to wait for it to come, Doc. Do you hear me? \r\nI am going to get it, and you are not going to have me, and this is all your \r\nloss.
