I go to tell alison I love her and before i even get the chance, she hands me my heart on a platter, basically tells me to have a nice life. What was i thinking, that she wouldn't go back to jamal? She loves him -- him, rafe, not you. At least i played it cool so she doesn't know just how much of a fool i really am. Yeah, alison, you practically read my mind. It's time to move on, make new friends, carpe diem while i still can. And I should. I should be doing that. But you know what? ", "Rafe: I miss her already. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: I am sorry you had to walk in on that whole scene with valerie. ", "Alison: No, don't be because it gave me a chance to hear something that i've been waiting a really, really long time to hear -- that you're going to be putting me -- or us first again, you know? ", "Jamal: Look, I've always had you first with me. But I never made you feel like it, and that's my fault. ", "Alison: Look, there's nobody to blame, ok? We've both been very distracted. But none of that matters anymore. What matters is that we're together. ", "Jamal: And we're going to stay that way. ", "Alison: Yeah. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Casey: Come on, you have to get me out of here now! ", "Ricky: Why? What are you wigging on? ", "Casey: Look, I don't have time to explain, ok? Just drive me to the park. ", "Ricky: The park? That's the big emergency? ", "Casey: Yes, you know, the place near the fountain. You know it? ", "Ricky: Yeah, I know it, and I can't take you there, all right? I just can't.", "Casey: Why not? ", "Ricky: You know why not. I got to drive my boss, who'll be here any second.", "Casey: So drive us both. It's a limo! ", "Ricky: Yeah, it's her limo, and I don't think she'll be into picking up whacked-out biker babes for trips to the park. ", "Casey: I'll be real quiet. ", "Ricky: Come on, casey, what are you not getting here, huh? I just got this gig and I can't lose it. ", "Casey: It's not like you're going to last more than two days, anyway. Ricardo, please, ok? Just -- you got to help me. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Amanda: Ricardo, where are you? I've been waiting. ", "Ricky: Sorry, babe, that's my cue. Coming, mrs. B. ", "Amanda: Straight home, ricardo, please. ", "Ricky: Yes, ma'am. Watch your head, mrs. B. ", "Amanda: Thank you. ", "Ricky: Are you comfortable in there, mrs. B? ", "Amanda: Just fine, thank you, but i am in a hurry. ", "Ricky: Ok, will do. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Casey: To the park, ricardo, and step on it. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Paige: What do you want? ", "Man: Oh, don't be scared, my dear. This won't hurt a bit. ", "Paige: Hurt? What won't hurt and who are you? ", "Lucy: Oh, good, I see you have met our dr. Gordon. So, what do you think? ", "Paige: Well, I don't know. Who is he exactly? ", "Lucy: Oh, well, he's only the top specialist in his field. I can't believe you've never heard of him. We were very, very lucky to get him for our little skin test. ", "Paige: What skin test? ", "Lucy: You know, what we talked about -- you coming to work for me at my cosmetics company. We're just going to need a simple little sample, that's all.", "Paige: A sample? ", "Lucy: Yeah, dr. Gordon can do it in a snap. He is going to do a complete analysis and find out everything there is to know about you and your skin, and that way we can get to the bottom of your secret of staying so young. What -- what's wrong? Is there a problem with that? ", "Paige: Absolutely. Both of you stay away from me. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc., And soapnet] ", "lucy: Oh, paige, listen, I'm so sorry. I did not mean to upset you at all. It's just I thought maybe you realized that if you come to work for me, it might involve a little skin sampling. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Paige: No, lucy, I didn't realize. ", "Lucy: Oh. ", "Kevin: What's going on up here? ", "Lucy: Hi. Nothing. Just a little misunderstanding. ", "Paige: Nothing I can't handle. ", "Dr. Gordon: I apologize for my part, ms. Smith. I assumed lucy told you I was here to get a skin sample. ", "Paige: It's ok. Look, lucy, I don't know how many times i have to tell you, there is nothing mysterious about my skin. I use all-natural products, things you could find in your own refrigerator. ", "Lucy: Well, maybe, but I can't help thinking there's some sort of mineral or vitamin in your skin. You know, we could find out if dr. Gordon -- oh, doc, this is dr. Gordon. Dr. Gordon, dr. Collins. Doctor, doctor. Doctors? ", "Kevin: Hello. ", "Dr. Gordon: Hello. ", "Lucy: Anyway, paige, come on, if we could just take a tiny, little sample -- it won't hurt or anything. ", "Paige: No, I don't want him anywhere near me. Look, lucy, I know i agreed to work with you, but this is not what i signed up for, all right? I don't want to do it, I'm sorry. ", "Kevin: And you don't have to. I'm sure lucy won't do anything to make you feel uncomfortable. Right, lucy? ", "Lucy: Right. I wouldn't dream of it. Dr. Gordon, I am so sorry for wasting your time. ", "Dr. Gordon: Ms. Smith, I really must say you do look remarkably young. Remarkably. At any rate, i apologize for the obvious distress i've caused you. Good-bye. ", "Paige: It's all right. I was just caught off guard, I think. ", "Lucy: Ahem. Thank you. I'll call you later, ok? Ta. ", "Kevin: Do you know your way out? ", "Lucy: See you soon. Paige -- oh, paige, you know, again, my apologies. I'm very sorry for upsetting you. ", "Paige: No, no, you know what -- I'm the one who should be apologizing. I overreacted and, god, you must think that i've gone mad. I mean, you know, I've just never really liked being examined. ", "Kevin: Well, that's perfectly understandable. Tell you what -- why don't we forget about skin samples and painting and everything else for a while. We'll go downstairs, we'll have a glass of wine before dinner. ", "Lucy: Oh, that is -- you're an idea man. That's a terrific idea. ", "Paige: Yes, it is a good idea, but I'm sorry, i can't join you. ", "Lucy: Uh-oh. Are you really mad at me? ", "Paige: No, no, it's just i think I forgot my purse at the recovery room, so i'm going to go back and check. ", "Kevin: Oh, well, we'll drive you over. ", "Paige: No, no, you two enjoy your evening. I'll catch a cab. ", "Lucy: Are you positive? ", "Paige: Positive. ", "Kevin: Well, you're going to need a little money if you left your wallet over there. ", "Paige: Right. Thanks. I'll pay you back. ", "Kevin: I just hope you find it. ", "Paige: I will. Thank you. ", "Lucy: Sorry again. Ta. ", "Paige: Yeah. Bye. ", "Kevin: A skin sample? ", "Lucy: I know, I know, I know. Ok, so i went a little far, but I couldn't help myself. Doc, come on, there is something up with that skin on that woman. Come on, she looks 25, 28 at the most. There's got to be some miracle to it and I want to find out what it is and then, if I get to the bottom of it, i can share it with the whole entire universe and then they'll be thanking me. But that's not what was really weird about all this. ", "Kevin: That wasn't the weird thing? ", "Lucy: No, that wasn't the weird thing. The weird thing is this. Look at this. This is her purse. It was sitting here the whole entire time. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: What? ", "Jamal: When i think that i almost lost you -- ", "alison: Shh. Just make love to me. ", "[Phone rings] ", "jamal: I'm not answering that. ", "Alison: Wait, you'd better get that. That might be important. Seriously. ", "[Ring] ", "jamal: Don't go anywhere. ", "Alison: Don't worry. ", "Jamal: Hello? Yeah. Doctor, hey. How is she? Ok. Ok, well, thanks for letting me know. All right. Bye. I am sorry about that, baby. I'm sorry. ", "Alison: No, stop trying to apologize, please? We can't pretend that valerie doesn't exist, ok, so -- what? ", "Jamal: She's fine. She's well taken care of. And my place is here with you. So, where were we? ", "Alison: Ok, look, I think that i'm going to go get us some dinner, ok? ", "Jamal: Now? ", "Alison: Yeah, I just -- something tells me that maybe later we're going to need all the energy we can get. ", "Jamal: Yeah, well, you got that right. ", "Alison: Ok, so what are you in the mood for? ", "Jamal: Um -- ", "alison: Wait, let me rephrase that, I'm sorry. What do you want for dinner?", "Jamal: You know, anything. I don't care. I'm going to grab a shower and then i'll be waiting when you get back. ", "Alison: Ok. I'll hurry. ", "Jamal: Ok. ", "Alison: Ok. I won't be long. ", "Jamal: Better not be. ", "Alison: I won'T.

", "Alison: How am i supposed to take you seriously when you have syrup all over your face? ", "Rafe: You have some, too. ", "Alison: It's my syrup, so i'll get it. ", "Rafe: Alison -- ", "rafe: Ah! ", "Alison: Don't! You're always doing this to me! What do you want more than anything in this world? ", "Rafe: I want to kiss you. ", "Alison: So then who's stopping you? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Well, maybe paige didn't know her purse was here or she forgot. ", "Lucy: Yeah, maybe, except for the fact I saw her look at it as she was leaving. ", "Kevin: Well, maybe she wanted to be anywhere except somewhere she felt like a science project. ", "Lucy: I know, I know. Maybe I should've warned her a little more. You know, I just figured if she comes to work for me, she'd know there'd be some skin testing involved. ", "Kevin: Oh, you didn't mean any harm. It's just that, lucy, sometimes in your enthusiasm, you get a little -- ", "lucy: I know, I get a little carried away. ", "Kevin: Yes. ", "Lucy: I can't help myself. I have that tendency. Maybe it's genetic. ", "Kevin: You know, on the other hand, paige's reaction was a little bit -- I don't know, exaggerated. ", "Lucy: A little bit? Doc, it was like i asked dr. Gordon to take out her spleen or liver or do an eye transplant or -- ", "kevin: I get it, I get it. Her buttons were pushed. ", "Lucy: Yeah. What do you make of that? What do you think that was all about?", "Kevin: I only know that it's none of our business. So let's just respect her feelings, ok, madam curie? ", "Lucy: Yeah, right. But -- ", "kevin: Oh, no buts. Let's just make paige as comfortable as possible so i can get through this painting her portrait thing, all right? ", "Lucy: All right, you're right. You need to concentrate on your painting. Oh, gosh, I guess I'll just -- I'll have to go away and let you get to your work, so ta. ", "Kevin: But? ", "Lucy: Uh-uh, dr. Collins, no buts. Ta. Work, work. ", "Kevin: Ta. Yeah, yeah.

This is not the way home. ", "Ricky: It's just a shortcut, mrs. B. ", "Amanda: Shortcut? What shortcut? I don't know of any shortcut to take us home. Heavens, what are you trying to do, get me killed? ", "Ricky: I thought you might want to stop here, mrs. B. ", "Amanda: And whatever would i want to do that for? ", "Ricky: To -- to enjoy the view. ", "Amanda: What view? ", "Ricky: Well, just take a look, mrs. B. I mean, from up here, the city lights just look so magical. ", "Casey: \"Magical\"? ", "Amanda: It's freezing in here. Will you roll up those windows, please? ", "Ricky: But, mrs. Barrington, did you -- ", "amanda: Now, listen, ricardo, this just is not going to work out. Now, just drive me home and that'll be the end of it. ", "Ricky: Gee, ma'am, I didn't mean to make you mad. I just thought that -- that someone as busy and important as yourself might want to take this opportunity to kind of relax. You know, kick it back there for a few, kind of take in the peace and tranquility of this -- this truly special place. I mean, smell the air, mrs. B, the wood burning in the fireplaces, the scent of the pine cones. ", "Amanda: I don't give a damn about the pine cones. I want to go home. ", "Ricky: All right, mrs. B, if that's what you want, we'll go. But can I -- can i tell you something first? And I hope i'm not out of line when i say this. You know, the way you look in this moonlight -- you have this glow about you that is absolutely luminous. ", "Amanda: Oh, stop it. ", "Ricky: You know, in fact, you should always notice everything -- everything beautiful because who knows about tomorrow, you know? I mean, things can change like that, and then you're left with what? Regret. ", "Amanda: There's nothing in life we should take for granted. ", "Ricky: Exactly. Stop and smell the roses. ", "Amanda: You're a very wise young man, and very sensitive. ", "Ricky: Why, thank you, mrs. B. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: I thought you were with -- I mean, I thought you were busy.

", "Alison: You know, when i said that i couldn't see you anymore, I mean, I sort of just meant that we shouldn't hang out like we used to. I mean, we're still friends. You know that, right?

", "Rafe: I mean, you know, I was just taking your advice, getting out there, living life, taking the bull by the horns while I still can, so -- ", "alison: Oh, yeah, I'm glad you're doing that. ", "Rafe: Yeah, it's cool. Anyway, I got to go. ", "Alison: Ok. ", "Rafe: So -- it was good to see you. Take care of yourself, ok? ", "Alison: Wait, you forgot your -- journal. Always sort of wondered what you write in here and why you never want me to see it. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Not bad. Not great, but really not bad. ", "Kevin: Ok. Here goes nothing. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dr. Gordon: I couldn't get over the incredible texture and tone of her skin. I have never seen anything like it in a woman her age. ", "Lucy: See? See? Didn't i tell you?

Wait a minute. What on earth? This can't be possible, can it? ", "Dr. Gordon: I double- and triple-checked it. ", "Lucy: Ok, let me get this straight -- what you're saying is paige's skin not only looks 25 years old -- ", "dr. Gordon: It is 25 years old. ", "Lucy: Oh, my goodness, she -- she managed to find a way to stop the clock.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: No, alison, don't do this. Because that's -- that's not right. That's rude. But maybe just a peek. Because we all know I will anyways. ", "Alison: He's good. He's a good writer. Why does he not want me to read this? Oh, my god. Rafe wasn't sent back here to experience life. He asked to come back here to put me and jamal back together. Why would he do something like that? Oh, my god. Rafe is in love with me. He gave up everything for me.
