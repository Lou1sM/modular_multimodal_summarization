        "Alison: Where? ",
        "Jamal: Where isn't the point. All right? It's about the ride. And I'm going \r\nto take you for the ride of your life, girl. Come on. ",

        "Ian: Ok. You all right? ",
        "Arianna: According to Dr. Neumann, I'm feeling the way a woman is supposed to \r\nwhen she's pregnant. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. Do you understand everything she was telling you? ",
        "Arianna: Yes. ",
        "Ian: About exercise and proper nutrition and all that? Good. Well, these are \r\nyour prenatal vitamins. There you go. You may as well start taking them right \r\naway. Let me get you some water. ",
        "Ian: All right. There you are. What's the matter? You having second thoughts?\r\n",
        "Arianna: About having this baby? ",
        "Ian: Under the circumstances, that's understandable. ",
        "Arianna: You mean because I was raped. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. If you're considering an abortion -- ",
        "Arianna: No. That's not an option for me. I heard the heartbeat. ",
        "Ian: Did you? ",
        "Arianna: There's a baby growing inside of me. But how am I going to take care \r\nof it? I have no home, no money -- ",
        "Ian: Don't worry about that, all right? ",
        "Arianna: How can I not worry? What am I going to do? ",

        "Lucy: Don. Hey, it's me. Listen, I want you to drop whatever you're doing and \r\ncall Wyndham's. I want you to tell them to have Chantal come over here right \r\naway to the hotel and tell them to make sure she brings everything she picked up \r\nin Milan this year. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and what's that guy -- you know the \r\none we met at the fashion show that everybody's raving about, that stylist that \r\nhas that weird hair? Siegfried! Yes! Have him sent over, too, right away. And -- \r\noh, and, Don, I want a realtor -- somebody really good. The best in town. Have \r\nthem sent over, too. Oh, I'll tell you what's up. Me. That's what's up. Well, \r\nI'll take that back. It's not really me. It's the new me, you know -- the new \r\nlook of me, the new feel of me, the new place to live of me, you know? It's -- \r\nit's good. Change is good. Oh. Well, um -- I'll tell you what brought it on. \r\nNever mind. You know what? You know what really brought this on is it's a new \r\nmillennium -- you know, the real one for a change. All those fireworks of last \r\nyear -- forget about that. This is time for me. This is my millennium, the new \r\nstart for me, because, Don, I want to spread my wings. I want to fly out there \r\nsolo. It's time for me to really get a life, you know? So chop, chop, Don. Do it \r\nright away, ok? Go, go, go, go, go. For me. Ok. Ta. ",

        "Ian: Someone like you? What are -- no, no, no, no, no. You did nothing wrong. \r\nYou were raped. It was not your fault. I don't care what your family says. ",
        "Arianna: Then why don't you want me here? ",

        "Arianna: He loves me. I can't believe he would go back on his word to me. ",
        "Ian: Let's not take any chances. There's a baby involved. ",
        "Arianna: I know why you don't really want me to stay here, and it has nothing \r\nto do with Ben. ",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? ",
        "Arianna: It's about Eve. You don't want to share your home with another woman \r\nwhen you still think there's a chance for you two. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I'm just remembering what it was like being here, thinking that I'd \r\nnever get out of this place, that we'd never get out of this place alive. And \r\nevery time Harris or one of his men would walk through that door, we thought \r\nthey were here to kill us. ",
        "Karen: Ok, we should go. We never should have come here. ",
        "Eve: This is where the lab was. This is where we had to work 24 hours a day \r\nto find a cure to save his life, knowing that we would die if we didn't. And \r\nover here -- this was where the wash basin was, where every night I would wash \r\nthe filth of this place off of me. ",
        "Karen: And where was Ian when you were washing up? ",
        "Eve: Well, he was here in this room. Harris was nice enough to put up a \r\nscreen. ",
        "Karen: And where did you sleep? ",
        "Eve: Here on this bed. ",
        "Karen: What about Ian? ",
        "Eve: Well, he -- he slept on the bed, too, but -- but -- but I was underneath \r\nthe covers and he was on top of the covers -- only until Harris gave us an extra \r\ncot. ",
        "Karen: But, still, you shared a bed for a while. ",

No, come -- I want something sleek and really red -- \r\nbright, bright red, you know? Set the test drive up and then just put it on my \r\ncalendar. Ok. All right. Ta. Oh! Yeow! That hurt. ",
