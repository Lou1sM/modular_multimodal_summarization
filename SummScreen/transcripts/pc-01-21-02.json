        "lucy: Hey, dr. Gordon, it's me again. Listen, I was just calling to see if -- \r\nyou did? Well, what are the results? You checked again and reconfirmed and? Oh, \r\nmy gosh. So the skin sample you took from paige is from a wom cannot be older \r\nthan 25 years old. Yes, yes. Oh, dr. Gordon, thank you so much for rechecking \r\nthat. Yeah, I'll talk to you soon. Ta. 25 years old. Paige has got to be a lot \r\nolder than that. So maybe paige isn't really paige. Maybe she's an impostor like \r\na sister or a babysitter or something, but not -- hi. Uh -- I was just looking \r\nfor you. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I was cleaning my brushes. Lucy, I got to tell you, you were \r\nright. Everything's coming back to me -- paige's portrait is started, the old \r\nbrush strokes, the old rhythms, everything. ",
        "Lucy: 25, 20 -- 25 years old. ",
        "Kevin: Sorry? ",
        "Lucy: What? Oh. Oh, I'm -- i'm sorry. I was just -- ",
        "kevin: Thinking, yeah, I can tell. What is it? ",
        "Lucy: Paige. You know, she really, really did freak out over that skin sample \r\nthing. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, we've been through this. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but we barely scratched the surface. Paige just swoops into \r\ntown on new year's eve, and you haven't heard a word from her in how long? ",
        "Kevin: Close to 20 years. ",
        "Lucy: Right, looking 15 years younger than she really -- ",
        "kevin: Lucy, what are you saying? ",
        "Lucy: I'm just saying, doc, are you sure paige is who she says she is? ",
        "Eve: Slow night? ",
        "Chris: Not for paperwork. Filling out forms is the reason i got into \r\nmedicine. ",
        "Eve: Come on, ramsey, you are so happy to have your job back, you'd be \r\ndancing a jig if they asked you to clean out the bedpans. ",
        "Chris: Right. Speaking of dancing a jig -- ",
        "ian: Evening, love. ",
        "Eve: Hi, sweetie. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Chris: Hi. Oh, right. ",
        "Eve: Me. Hey, i was looking everywhere for you. Amy is gone. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, I know she was looking for an apartment. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but just to pack up and leave so abruptly like that? It doesn't \r\nmake sense. ",
        "Ian: I -- i may have insulted her a wee bit. ",
        "Eve: What? How, ian? What did you say to her? ",
        "Ian: Oh, I may have accused her of -- of being an alien. ",
        "Casey: Did you hear what i said? There's another one here, one of our kind!\r\n",
        "Paige: Tell us exactly what you saw. ",
        "Casey: Look, I just did! ",
        "Amy: Details. ",
        "Paige: Don't leave anything out. Start with where. ",
        "Casey: At that hellhole i'm slaving away in. Look, I saw him, ok? I felt him. \r\nLook, paige, i can't go back. You know what? He could be a regular in there or \r\nsomething. ",
        "Amy: Uh-huh. ",
        "Paige: Ah. So out of nowhere, one of us starts hanging around a restaurant \r\nwhere you would give anything not to be working. ",
        "Casey: It's true. ",
        "Amy: I guess you never heard of the old story about the young boy who cried \r\n\"wolf.\" ",
        "Casey: Look, I'm not lying, ok? I swear. Look, I don't know why he's here, I \r\ndon't know who he is, but I know what I saw, ok, and I know what it means, too \r\n-- big trouble for all of us. ",
        "Alison: This cannot be true. I must've read this wrong. I really shouldn't \r\neven be reading rafe's journal at all. ",
        "Rafe's voice: \"I gave up being a guardian angel to come back to earth and \r\nhelp alison and jamal get back together. But now I see that was a lie. The real \r\nreason I gave it all up was to just be with alison, near alison. Because I'm in \r\nlove with her.\" ",
        "Rafe: Alison? What are you doing? ",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc., And soapnet] ",
        "rafe: Please don't tell me you were actually reading this. ",
        "Alison: No -- no, I wasn't. I -- it just -- I picked it up because it was \r\njust sitting there, so I didn't want anybody to take it, so i -- ",
        "rafe: Right. Well, that's a good thing because the stuff in here will just \r\nput you to sleep. You know, people don't want other people to know how boring \r\ntheir lives actually are. So, you know, I should probably be more careful with \r\nthis. Why are you staring at me like that? ",
        "Alison: What? No. No, I'm not. I just -- or i didn't -- I didn't really think \r\nthat i was. I mean, I'm just looking at your face and -- it's just that -- ",
        "rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: You know, when i said that i -- I really wanted us to be friends, i \r\nmeant it, you know. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, see, friends do things together. They -- they hang out, \r\nthey do stuff. We can't, and you were right. I agree. Ok? ",
        "Alison: Oh, that's good. I just -- you know, I'm just glad that you, like, \r\nunderstand. But -- ",
        "rafe: But what? ",
        "Alison: I just -- I mean, I want you to know that I still really care about \r\nyou, and I just really want you to be really happy. ",
        "Rafe: Thanks. I -- i want that for you, too. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Um -- ok, so -- ",
        "rafe: Well -- ",
        "alison: I better -- I better go. ",
        "Rafe: All right. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'm -- i'm just going to go. Yeah. Ok. Bye. ",
        "Rafe: Bye -- bye, bye, bye. \"I just want to be near alison. With alison.\" Oh. \r\nHey, guy. ",
        "Bartender: What can i do for you? ",
        "Rafe: You got a garbage over there? Because I got some trash for you, ok? ",
        "Bartender: You sure about that, buddy? ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. Positive. Absolutely positive. ",
        "Kevin: Of course paige is paige. Who else would know every detail of the time \r\nwe spent together 20 years ago? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. Maybe her sister? ",
        "Kevin: No. Paige is an only child. ",
        "Lucy: But -- ",
        "kevin: \"But\" nothing. \"But\" nothing, lucy. No doubts, no question in my mind. \r\nPaige is the woman that I knew, in the flesh. ",
        "Lucy: 25-year-old flesh. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, no. Oh, no, here it goes again -- the out-of-control epidemic. ",
        "Lucy: What are you talking about, the \"epidemic\"? ",
        "Kevin: The port charles paranoia -- that epidemic. Hey, i've been as guilty \r\nas anyone in the last few months, but I was really hoping we'd put it behind us. \r\nAnd now victor's running around telling everyone that martians have landed, and \r\nian's questioning poor amy. ",
        "Lucy: Amy -- that's the girl you worked with, the blind woman. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, the blind woman. Apparently she had her hands on that weird \r\nlittle machine that victor's been dragging around, so ian thought she was going \r\nto, I don't know, sabotage it or something. And, well, that alone proves that \r\nshe's from alpha centauri. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Paige and amy showed up in town exactly the same day, didn't \r\nthey? ",
        "Kevin: You're not serious. ",
        "Lucy: I'm serious. It's possible. Possible -- ",
        "kevin: It's possible but not probable. Lucy, if you really believe that paige \r\nand amy are not of this earth, then show me. Show me some evidence. ",
        "Lucy: You want -- ok. What if I could prove to you that paige not only looks \r\n25 years old, she really is 25 years old? I prove it, what would you say? ",
        "Paige: That's enough, casey. ",
        "Casey: I'm telling you -- ",
        "paige: Wrong! This time I'm telling you. Look, we're both getting a little \r\nbit tired of your games. Since the moment we got here, it's been nothing but one \r\nproblem after another, and they've all started with you. ",
        "Amy: People are asking me if i'm an alien now, thanks to you. ",
        "Casey: Look, it's not my fault if everyone thinks you're a weirdo. ",
        "Paige: We're all in this together. We have to be. God, what's it going to \r\ntake to get through to you? ",
        "Casey: Look, it's not just the three of us here anymore. There's another one. \r\nYou both got to believe me. ",
        "Amy: Why should we? ",
        "Paige: You haven't exactly inspired a great deal of trust. ",
        "Casey: Ok, so -- so i messed up at first, ok, so what? You guys said to fix \r\nit, I fixed it. I went to the cops and now i'm working at that stupid place. \r\nWhat else do you want from me? Well, ok, fine -- what, you don't trust me? Then \r\nlet's go to the restaurant now, ok? If you don't, you'll be sorry because you \r\nknow what? Who knows why he's here or what he wants or what will happen to us?\r\n",
        "Amy: What do you think, paige? ",
        "Paige: I think we can't take the chance. Let's go see for ourselves. ",
        "Casey: Smart move. ",
        "Amy: Listen -- you better be right about this because if this is some \r\nwild-goose chase, then you -- ",
        "casey: It's not, ok? ",
        "Paige: It better not be. There's too much at stake. ",
        "Ian: What are you laughing at, ramsey? ",
        "Chris: You, who else? I'm not the only one, either. ",
        "Eve: I can't believe you accused amy of being an alien. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, hey, thornhart, she didn't try to probe you or anything, did \r\nshe? Because that's the oldest one in the book. ",
        "Ian: Don't you have somewhere to be, boy? ",
        "Chris: Not really. Actually, I have a question, though. How may \r\nsight-challenged aliens does it take to change a dilithium crystal? Because I \r\nneed to know. ",
        "Eve: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. ",
        "Ian: I don't know, but I do know how many irish doctors it takes to take --\r\n",
        "eve: Ok, ok, ok, hold on. He's just kidding you, ian. You know, I'm sure that \r\nonce amy recovers, she'll accept your apology and -- and, hey, you know, we can \r\nmake it up to her. ",
        "Ian: How? Don't start -- ",
        "eve: Well, maybe we could introduce her to a few of our friends and set her \r\nup on a date. ",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's a brilliant idea. Just don't tell the chump \r\nthat you tried to fix her up with cpt. Shamrock here who thinks she's from a \r\ngalaxy far, far away. ",
        "Eve: Too late, ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Why? ",
        "Eve: Well, you'll find out when you meet her. She's really, really a lovely, \r\nlovely person. ",
        "Chris: Oh, no, no, no -- wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not talking about me.\r\n",
        "Eve: Why not? ",
        "Chris and ian: No. ",
        "Kevin: You did what? ",
        "Lucy: Well, everybody sheds skin cells, so i didn't do anything. I didn't \r\nhave to. All dr. Gordon did was shake her hand and that gave him all the skin \r\nsamples he needed. ",
        "Kevin: But paige never consented to be tested! She still doesn't know! ",
        "Lucy: Oh, well -- yeah, and that -- and it's good because she doesn't know \r\nthat we know. But, doc, those skin cells are from a 25-year-old, not a day \r\nolder, and dr. Gordon said he's never seen anything like that in his whole \r\nprofessional career, except on a -- well, you know -- ",
        "kevin: Except on a 25-year-old? ",
        "Lucy: Exactly. So don't you see what this means? ",
        "Kevin: That means nothing. It means she's lucky, that's all. She's been \r\ngenetically blessed with good skin. So what? But what she's not -- and I'd stake \r\nmy life on this -- is someone from outer space. ",
        "Lucy: You didn't believe in vampires. You didn't think they were possible and \r\nlook what happened. ",
        "Kevin: You know what I think? I think it's very flattering. And it's \r\nperfectly normal behavior when someone comes back into someone else's newlywed \r\nlife, asks him to paint her portrait, which is, I admit, an intimate thing which \r\nyou pushed me to do. ",
        "Lucy: Whoa. Wait just a minute here. Why don't you just go out and say it? \r\nYou think I'm making a big something out of a great, big, fat nothing, don't \r\nyou? You say it. You think I'm jealous. That's what this is all about. You think \r\nI'm just jealous. ",

        "Jamal: There you are. ",
        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Something smells good. Looks pretty tasty, too. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: I was just about to send out a search party for you. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm sorry. I sort of got a little held up. ",
        "Jamal: Everything ok? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. You know what? I think that it -- it can be. I think that we \r\njust need to spend a little bit more time on us, you know, because we've been so \r\ncaught up in so many other things. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, I missed you. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I've missed you, too. ",
        "Jamal: It's been too long, way too long. ",
        "Alison: What about the food? ",
        "Jamal: What about it? That's what microwaves are for, right? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: What's going on? What's wrong? ",
        "Alison: What? Um -- nothing. I think that maybe i'm just sort of coming down \r\nwith a -- a bug or something. ",
        "Jamal: Anything i can do? ",
        "Alison: No. I just -- I think -- you know, jamal, i think i'm just going to \r\nturn in early, actually, and maybe take a hot bath or something. I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, about what? ",
        "Alison: Well, you know -- but you could, like, hold me if you like. ",
        "Jamal: \"If\"? Come on, what are you talking about? Hey, this -- this feeling, \r\nthat out-of-it feeling that you're having -- this is not about valerie, is it?\r\n",
        "Alison: No. Valerie who? ",
        "Jamal: Ok. All right, got it. Look, you go rest, and i will be right here.\r\n",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Ok? ",

        "bartender: Hey, hey, you ok, buddy? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah, I just -- just felt something. ",
        "Bartender: Well, what kind of something? ",
        "Rafe: Huh. I don't know. Just something. ",
        "Casey: Come on, he's probably still here. ",
        "Amy: We'll see. ",

        "Paige: You mean that you -- ",
        "amy: Yes. Can't you feel it? It's one of us. He's close, he's real close. I \r\ncan feel his presence. ",
        "Casey: There! Look for yourself! He's right there! ",
        "Paige: Let me see. If he is one of us, then -- ",
        "paige: No. ",
        "Amy: What happened? ",
        "Paige: It is one of us, and I think he can feel us, too. I think he knows \r\nwe're here. ",
        "Chris: No way, no how am i going out with a feisty blind chick from mars. ",
        "Eve: Come on, ramsey, she's really cute. ",
        "Ian: Wait -- no, no, no, no, they're completely mismatched. You got a caring, \r\nsensitive woman, and he's -- ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Thank you. ",

        "Eve: Ok. ",

        "Eve: What if I told you that i'm not taking no for an answer? Chri e, i'm not \r\nready. ",
        "Eve: Julie told you herself that you need to move on. This amy girl's really, \r\nreally special. ",
        "Chris: Oh. Oh, I bet she has a great personality, too. Come on, that's a \r\nfix-up line if i've ever heard one. ",
        "Eve: Hey, listen, i would never just fix you up for the heck of it. Ok? \r\nPlease, just -- do this. Trust me, you won't regret it. ",
        "Chris: Trust you? Ok, fine, one date, but that's it. And I'm warning you, if \r\nshe tries to impregnate me with her two-headed martian love child, you're paying \r\nfor college. ",
        "Colleen: Ian. Excuse me. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Colleen: I meant to give you this earlier, but I forgot. Sorry. ",

        "Colleen: Oh, something personal. ",
        "Ian: Thanks. Ok. From amy, huh? All right. \"Dear ian, please accept my \r\napology for the way I acted. I treasure our friendship. All is forgiven and \r\nforgotten. Love, your favorite martian.\" She really is something. ",
        "Lucy: Come on, admit it. ",
        "Kevin: I don't want to fight. ",
        "Lucy: No, admit it. You're jealous. I don't want to fight, either. Just \r\nlisten, ok? Just -- ",

        "Lucy: You know, maybe you're right. ",
        "Kevin: I'm what? ",
        "Lucy: Maybe you're right. You know, come to think of it, maybe I am jealous \r\nand that is what this is all about. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I know i'd feel that way. I mean, lucy, painting a portrait can \r\ntake weeks. If you were spending that amount of time with an ex, I'd be jealous.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Thanks for saying that. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, if you don't want me to do this, it's over. I'll go tell her \r\nright now. You come first in my life, always. ",
        "Lucy: Ooh, thanks -- but no, no, I understand how important this is to you \r\nand how important it is to paige. And it's very important for you to keep your \r\npromise to paige, so i'll muddle through somehow. I can take it. I'll be fine.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I love you and only you. It's that simple. So we're settled? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah, we're settled. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Then i guess i better get back to it. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Then i guess i'll go make you some coffee. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, thanks. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. My pleasure. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Victor? Hi, it's me. Listen, I'm a little bit worried. Actually, \r\nmaybe I'm a lot worried. You know, I just -- I'm wondering about this paige \r\nperson. You know, I'm afraid maybe she's running some sort of con on doc, and I \r\nwant to talk to you about it, kind of feel it out. Can you meet me in the park \r\nlater and, victor, you know, mum's the word, all that stuff. Don't say anything \r\nto anybody. I just want to talk to you first. Ok. Ta. Oh, doc, you are so wrong. \r\nI am not jealous. But I certainly don't like what it is I am feeling. ",
        "Rafe's voice: \"The real reason i gave it all up was to just be with alison. \r\nNear alison. Because I'm in love with her.\" ",
        "Alison: I can't believe it. ",
        "Jamal: What's that? ",
        "Alison: Hmm? Oh. I'm -- no, i was just thinking. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: About what? ",
        "Alison: Just, you know, like, all the crazy stuff that's been happening \r\naround here lately. Do you think maybe -- ",
        "jamal: Do i think maybe what? ",
        "Alison: That we should spend some time alone. ",
        "Jamal: That's what we're doing. ",
        "Alison: I know, but somewhere else without, like, all the distractions and \r\neverything, you know, so that we can, like, just really reconnect. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, the more i think about it, the better it sounds. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. Me, too, jamal. ",
        "Rafe: What's happening? I know there was something here. I felt it. I know \r\nit. Someone. ",
        "Amy: Are you sure he's not following us? ",
        "Paige: I don't know. I don't think so. ",
        "Casey: No way. We'd have seen him or heard him at least. ",
        "Amy: I don't know about that. ",
        "Paige: He's not like us, casey. ",
        "Amy: We're not angels, not yet. ",
        "Paige: But he sure is, a powerful one at that. He might even be a guardian.\r\n",
        "Amy: But he's here in a human form. ",
