        "Lucy: Thank you very much. You are going to absolutely adore my new house. \r\nIt's so spacious and light and airy, and it has a primo, state-of-the-art \r\nkitchen I can cook up a storm in -- if I knew how to cook. ",
        "Livvie: Wow. This is all happening so fast. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, listen -- bedrooms. I have got the best -- it's so neat. One \r\nadorable one for Serena, and then of course I have one for you, and mine is \r\ngreat. But the super thing about this house is there's so much privacy, you \r\nknow? So when we bring our dates home, we can be alone. ",
        "Livvie: Since when have you decided to date? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, well, I had a date last night. ",
        "Livvie: Really? ",
        "Lucy: I want you to realize that you are now looking at the new, improved \r\nLucy Coe, party girl extraordinaire. ",
        "Livvie: Wow, did I just crash-land in the twilight zone? Who was your date?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait. You have to know who my decorator is. This fabulous \r\nperson. You're going to love it. I got all new furnishing so it makes the house \r\nlook incredible, and I'm checking out of the hotel tomorrow morning. By \r\nnightfall I will be in my new, luscious Jacuzzi, sipping champagne. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, ok, I see. New house, new furniture, big date. Does any of this \r\nhave to do with the fact that Eve and Kevin are renewing their marriage vows \r\ntomorrow? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Are you -- you still upset about going to Harris' compound yesterday?\r\n",
        "Eve: No. No, I've put that behind me. I was just thinking capons. ",
        "Kevin: Capons? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. You know, those little chickens? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I know what they are. I was just kind of wondering why you were \r\nthinking about them. ",
        "Eve: Well, I told the caterer that I wanted those served tomorrow at the \r\nceremony, and, you know, I just want everything to be perfect. ",
        "Kevin: Are you having second thoughts? ",
        "Eve: About the food? No. Are you? ",
        "Kevin: No, no, of course not. Capons sound great. ",
        "Eve: Well, it's supposed to be a beautiful day. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Not a cloud in the sky. ",
        "Eve: Right. I have so much to do. I have plans that I still have to take care \r\nof, I've got a zillion phone calls to make. I can't wait to get started. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I've got to get down to the station and make sure that Mac \r\nactually shows up at our wedding this time. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: I can't wait to marry you all over again. ",
        "Eve: I can't wait till tomorrow. ",
        "Kevin: You know what? You're going to make an even more beautiful bride. ",
        "Eve: Karen? Hi, it's Eve. Listen, I'm going to come into the hospital in a \r\nlittle bit. I want to be back on rotation. But, listen, I wanted to just make \r\nsure that Ian isn't back on staff yet. He isn't? Ok, good. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian, I had to find you. I know. I know we fell in love. ",
        "Ian: You remembered. ",
        "Eve: I'm so sorry I put you through all that. ",
        "Ian: I don't care about that. All I care about is that you're in my arms \r\nright now. ",
        "Chris: So who's the new woman in your life? ",
        "Ian: What time is it? What -- ",
        "Chris: Got the chart on your Jane Doe. Heard she's a friend. What's the \r\nstory? ",
        "Ian: Let me look at that. ",
        "Chris: Hey -- ",
        "Ian: I need to go see her. ",
        "Chris: No. No, no, can't let you do that. You're not even on staff anymore.\r\n",
        "Ian: Chris, do me a favor. I'm the only one this woman trusts. Might've been \r\nher own brother pushed her down the stairs. ",
        "Chris: Her own brother? ",
        "Ian: Her family cannot go in there to see her. Come on. ",
        "Chris: Fine. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. ",
        "Arianna: Ben! Ben! Don't let him near me! ",
        "Ian: Hey, hey, hey, it's ok. I'm here. No one's going to hurt you. I promise. \r\nIt's ok. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: You sure know how to rain on a party girl's parade here. You know, I'm \r\njust -- I'm trying to have fun. I am not thinking about Kevin and how disgusting \r\nit is and wrong for him to be renewing his vows with Eve. ",
        "Livvie: It's killing you, isn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Look, Livvie, Kevin's just trying to do the right thing -- you know, \r\nlive up to his wedding vows. You got to love a guy who tries to be faithful, \r\nright? Even if it's to the wrong person. ",
        "Livvie: No, I think that maybe he's just feeling guilty because the two of \r\nyou got so close when he thought Eve had died. I mean, no one is going to wind \r\nup living happily ever after this way -- ",
        "Lucy: But -- ",
        "Livvie: And if you start talking about breakfast nooks and closet space \r\nagain, I'm going to scream. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, I was going to compliment you. You're very insightful. You have \r\na very old soul for such a young person. How did you get so wise? ",
        "Livvie: Actually, I've -- I've been meaning to tell you something, but the \r\ntiming never seemed right. And now, since the subject has been brought up -- I \r\nmet a guy. ",
        "Lucy: You met a -- what's he like? Is he smart? I mean, does he treat you \r\nnice? Is he -- where did you meet him? ",
        "Livvie: He's just a guy, a really, really great guy. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. I can tell by the look on your face he is pretty special, huh?\r\n",
        "Livvie: And we've gotten really, really close. ",
        "Lucy: \"Really, really close.\" What do you mean? Are you sleeping together?\r\n",
        "",
        "Kevin: Well, you either like it here or you're in trouble again. ",
        "Jack: Well, I'm actually here transferring my paperwork from Westford to Port \r\nCharles. But, sir, you have my word, I'm going to get my life back in order. For \r\nLivvie. ",
        "Kevin: It won't be easy with a record. ",
        "Jack: No sweat. I'm going to talk to my probation office to see if they could \r\nhook me up with a job here in Port Charles. Dr. Collins, you have nothing to \r\nworry about, sir. I'm going to be going now. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Mac: Friend of yours? ",
        "Kevin: That's Livvie's boyfriend. ",
        "Mac: Oh, great. So now when they're out late, you won't have to wait home \r\nalone for them because the probation officer will be there with you. Believe me, \r\nI can relate. ",
        "Kevin: Well, for Livvie's sake, I'm trying to give the kid the benefit of the \r\ndoubt. But that's not why I'm here. I have an invitation for you. Tomorrow, Eve \r\nand I are renewing our wedding vows, and this time there is no excuse for you \r\nnot to be there. ",
        "Mac: Kevin, you guys haven't been married a year yet. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's important to Eve, and since I came so close to almost \r\nlosing her, I want to show her how much she means to me. ",
        "Mac: Count me in. ",
        "Kevin: Great. Oh, it's going to be a great day. All of our friends are \r\ncoming. We're -- we're having capons. Eve's excited. This is everything she \r\nwants. ",
        "Mac: And you? ",
        "Kevin: I want to make her happy. I'm lucky to have Eve for a wife. ",
        "Mac: Kevin, are you trying to convince me of this, or yourself? ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry I brought so much trouble to your life. ",
        "Ian: You're the least of my troubles, believe me. Just glad you're in one \r\npiece. ",
        "Arianna: And my brother? ",
        "Ian: He's nowhere to be found. What happened? ",
        "Arianna: I fell down the stairs. ",
        "Ian: You fell down the stairs. Your brother had nothing to do with it? ",
        "Arianna: Ben came back to take me home. He went back on his promise to spare \r\nmy life. I tried to run from him. We struggled, and I fell. Ben didn't push me \r\ndeliberately. ",
        "Ian: He left you lying there. ",
        "Arianna: How did I get here? ",
        "Ian: I found you and I brought you in. ",
        "Arianna: If you hadn't found me in time -- ",
        "Ian: I got there when I could. As soon as you're better and get back on your \r\nfeet, I want to take you to this place I told you about, this shelter. You'll be \r\nsafe there. ",
        "Arianna: Will they still accept me even though I'm going to have a baby? I \r\nwant my child to have every chance for a good life. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Colleen. ",
        "Colleen: Eve, hi. It's great to see you up and around. We were worried sick \r\nabout you. ",
        "Eve: Thanks. I'm fine now, really. So, I'm ready to come back to work. ",
        "Colleen: Great. Is that why you're here today? ",
        "Eve: Yes, it is. Where's the warden? ",
        "Colleen: Oh, Dr. Ramsey is around somewhere being his usual charming self.\r\n",
        "Eve: Well, I wouldn't expect anything less, so point the way. ",
        "Colleen: The man you want is in that room. ",
        "Chris: Hey, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Chris: You're back. ",
        "Eve: Hey. You are just the doctor I was looking for. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I -- ",
        "Arianna: Is there something wrong with me? The baby. Is it the baby? ",
        "Ian: You're young and healthy, and one day you will have a man who loves you, \r\nand you'll get married and you'll have many children. ",
        "Arianna: But not this one. ",
        "Ian: No. Not this one. I'm sorry. ",
        "Arianna: I never asked for this child. It would have been difficult to raise \r\na baby on my own. God, I would have loved this baby. ",
        "Ian: I know. I can see that. And next time you will have a loving husband by \r\nyour side, and you will share this together. ",
        "Arianna: I've never been in love. I don't even know what that feels like. ",
        "Ian: When you're in love with the right person, there's nothing like it in \r\nthe world. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Don't even try to suck up to me, Lambert. Hell, you've been in town, \r\nwhat, a few weeks now, and you haven't even come by to say hello to your best \r\nfriend? Well, perhaps I'm your former best friend. ",
        "Eve: I'm sure you'll live. ",
        "Chris: Yeah. So will you, huh? I got to tell you, when I heard about that \r\nexplosion and thought you were dead, it hit me pretty hard. ",
        "Eve: I'm sure you were simply devastated. I mean, because with me gone, that \r\nwould leave you with how many friends? Oh, oh, that would be zero. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, just be careful. I'm still your boss. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. That's the part of my memory that is still crystal clear. Anyway, \r\nlisten, I want you to put me back on rotation next week, ok? ",
        "Chris: You look fit enough to start right now. ",
        "Eve: Why, thank you. However, Kevin and I are renewing our wedding vows \r\ntomorrow. And no, you're not invited. ",
        "Chris: Renewing your vows, huh? Isn't that something that geriatrics do on \r\ntheir 50th wedding anniversary right after they go out and pick out the burial \r\nplots next to each other? ",
        "Eve: Typical Ramsey reaction. See, because you can't stand to see anybody \r\nelse happy because your love life is sinking faster than the Titanic. ",
        "Chris: I see. Well, I will put you on the schedule for next week. And for the \r\nrecord, my love life is just fine because, you see, I always know where the \r\nlifeboats are. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Ok, I can see that it's now time for that woman-to-woman, \r\nheart-to-heart chat. Come on. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, if this is a sex talk, I'd rather go back to discussing \r\nfloor tiles. Kevin tried to give me the lecture the other day and it just, I \r\ndon't know, really freaked me out a little bit. ",
        "Lucy: I promise I will not lecture you. Me, of all people -- no, I won't. ",
        "Livvie: He was really cool and all. It's just your sex life is the last thing \r\nyou want to discuss with your father. ",
        "Lucy: I know. You're right. But you do really need to talk about it with \r\nsomebody, and that somebody better be me. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I will, and I'm going to be smart about it. And if I'm going to \r\ntake any steps, I'll make sure they're the right steps and precautions, and if \r\nand when I need -- ",
        "Lucy: I know, but, listen, I'm not just talking about those kind of \r\nprecautions. See, when you become intimate with somebody, it sort of changes \r\neverything. You can't go back. And so the kind of protection I'm talking about \r\nis making sure you don't get hurt. Making sure that other person feels the same \r\nway, that it's mutual. ",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to plan or calculate anything. I'm just going to, you \r\nknow, follow my heart and see where it leads me. But, yeah, I think I'm ready.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, there really isn't anything quite as incredible as being in \r\nlove with someone who's free to love you back. You know, I had that with Doc \r\nonce, but I sort of got a little careless and I lost him. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm going to watch my step. You don't have to worry about me.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I really, really do worry about you. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, which one of us just got out of jail, ok? I'm the one who should \r\nbe worried about you. Right? ",
        "Lucy: Good point. I did just get out of -- I'm fine. It was just a \r\nmisunderstanding. In fact, I need to go. You know, I need to take care of that \r\nmisunderstanding and -- wow, you know, I just had the weirdest hunch that if I \r\ngo down there right now, things are going to work out somehow. Huh. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: I'll see you. ",
        "Livvie: Bye-bye. ",
        "Lucy: Ta. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: My wife and I are renewing our wedding vows. It's as simple as that. \r\nI'm not trying to convince you of anything. And I'm just damn happy to have my \r\nwife back home. ",
        "Mac: Of course you are. I'll tell you what, I'll bring the champagne. Is \r\nthere anything else I can do for you? ",
        "Kevin: Actually, there is something. ",
        "Mac: Hey, I hope it has to do with the bachelor party. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, you wish. Do you think there's any way you can get these charges \r\nagainst Lucy dropped? ",
        "Mac: It's kind of a weird request for a wedding gift, but I'll see what I can \r\ndo. ",
        "Kevin: Maybe put a muzzle on Garcia. I mean, Lucy changed a DNA report. She \r\ndidn't rob a bank. She doesn't deserve to be punished like this. And frankly, \r\nI'd hate to see her get in so much trouble only because she was trying to help \r\nme out, especially after she and I -- so, can you do it? ",
        "Mac: I can't make the charges disappear completely, but I can probably swing \r\nit so Lucy doesn't have to do any jail time. ",
        "Kevin: I owe you. Whatever you do, don't let Lucy know that I was here \r\npleading her case. The less she knows about my involvement, the better. ",
        "Mac: Kevin, you were never here. It's just -- ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Mac: Don't you think it's kind of funny that the day before you renew your \r\nwedding vows with Eve, you're here worrying about Lucy? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Excuse me. Is this where I pick up my prescription? ",
        "Colleen: Sure. What's your prescription for? ",
        "Livvie: Uh -- it was supposed to be ready this morning. ",
        "Colleen: Ok. Here you go. ",
        "Livvie: Thanks. ",
        "Colleen: Hey, hey. Don't you want to check that? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, no. I'm sure everything's fine. Thanks. ",
        "Chris: Colleen, is everything all right with that patient? ",
        "Colleen: Oh, yeah, sure. She was just picking up her prescription. ",
        "Chris: Do you know what for? ",
        "Colleen: Dr. Ramsey, you know I can't give that information. ",
        "Chris: Birth-control pills? ",
        "Chris: It's me. Got an assignment for you. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Oh, hi. ",
        "Jack: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: My jailbird buddy. How the heck are you? ",
        "Jack: Pretty good now that I'm on this side of the bars. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, wait, let me remember -- you had this brother and girlfriend \r\ntrouble. How'd that turn out? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Got it under control. ",
        "Lucy: Really? ",
        "Jack: How about you? Did you get your troubles worked out? ",
        "Lucy: Don't ask. Don't go there, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God, that's Lucy! I'm not here, ok? ",

        "Kevin: I don't care, I don't care! ",
        "Lucy: Hey, Mac. It's really nice to see a friendly face around here for a \r\nchange. ",
        "Mac: Hey, Lucy. What can I do for you? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I have to do my good deed of the day. I really need to apologize \r\nto Garcia. ",
        "Mac: As it turns out, you're not going to have to do that. ",
        "Lucy: What? What happened? ",
        "Mac: Well, things are looking pretty good for you. I mean, right now you \r\nmight be facing a fine, community service, your basic slap on the wrist. No jail \r\ntime. ",
        "Lucy: A slap on the wrist for assaulting an officer and switching DNA \r\nevidence? ",
        "Mac: All of it. ",
        "Lucy: That's strange. ",
        "Mac: No. No, not at all. It's your first offense. Standard. ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no, I'm not talking about that. Mac, I could've sworn that \r\nKevin was here. Doc was here. ",
        "Mac: No, Lucy, Kevin's not here. ",
        "Lucy: You know -- Mac, you know how it is between Doc and me. You know how \r\nI've always had that thing where I can pick up on his vibes. He was here, wasn't \r\nhe? I mean, one minute I'm facing those ugly blue kind of -- or are they orange \r\nnow? -- prison suits and losing my hair dryer, and the next minute I'm free as a \r\nbird, no jail time? Wait, wait, wait. Doc's behind this, isn't he? He is. ",
        "Mac: No, Lucy, it's just your lucky day. ",
        "Lucy: I know Doc's behind this. I feel it in my gut. No, actually, I feel it \r\nin my heart. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Well, you should rest. And don't worry about your safety. I put a guard \r\noutside. He was the biggest, scariest one they had. ",
        "Arianna: I've had some bad luck in my life. But it was wonderful luck that \r\nbrought me to your door. ",
        "Ian: Well, as soon as you get back on your feet, we'll get you settled safely \r\nin this shelter I told you about, ok? ",
        "Arianna: \"Safe.\" It will be so good to feel safe again, to not have to live \r\nevery day looking over my shoulder. ",

        "Ian: Yeah, you've thanked me enough. And you getting better is all the thanks \r\nI need, anyway. Just take it one day at a time, all right? You'll be fine. Just \r\nwish I could say the same about me. \r\n\u00a0",
