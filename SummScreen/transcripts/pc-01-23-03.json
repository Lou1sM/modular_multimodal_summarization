        "When Rafe doesn't return from the yacht, Alison takes off to look for him. Elizabeth orders Joshua to leave her daughter alone, but he insists that it's Alison's decision to make, not hers. Trying to get him to back off from his obvious efforts to seduce Alison, Elizabeth spills the beans about her daughter's real reason for travelling to Capri. Joshua insists that she won't find what she's looking for. He tricks Elizabeth into having another drugged drink. On the yacht, the captain prepares to throw a chained Rafe overboard. His plan is interrupted by a problem on deck, which was arranged by Alison. Rafe informs her that the captain is on Joshua's payroll, and she concludes that Caleb and Joshua probably killed her father. Alison wants to rescue Rafe, but he assures her that he has a plan. He sends her back to her room and tells her to lock herself in. After receiving orders to kill Rafe as soon as possible, the captain points a gun at him. Rafe magically removes the chains, and the gun flies from the captain's hand. Instead of going straight to her own room, Alison rushes to her mother's room and is caught by Joshua, who tells her that she shouldn't have interfered. Back in Port Charles, Ian's research isn't going well. When Lucy stops by to help, Ian insists that there's nothing she can do. Frustrated, he admits to feeling like a trapped animal. Believing that a change of scenery would do him good, Lucy urges him to go to his cabin, where he can continue his research in peace. Agreeing, Ian asks her to drive him there, but he won't let her stay with him. At the cabin, they discover that the extreme cold has cracked all the water bottles, and every drop of the special water is gone.",

        "Ian: What happened?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I don't know him anymore. I don't care about that right now. I want to help you. Look at you. I want to help you focus on your research. Are you ok? Have you made any progress here? I'm here just to help, ok?",

        "Ian: Because this stuff, it -- it works for a little while, I don't know. And after that, I don't -- I don't know. I don't want to hurt you.",

        "Elizabeth: Stop asking me about Alison.",
        "Joshua: Elizabeth, I am concerned about her.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I'm very well aware of your concern for her.",
        "Joshua: Well, if you won't go next door and see if she's all right --",
        "Elizabeth: She has every right to stay in her room if she wants to.",

        "Elizabeth: Well, she came here to prove that he's not.",
        "Joshua: Really?",
        "Elizabeth: Yes. She's not over him, and she's not going to get over him. And as soon as she gets the proof, they'll be back together. She's going to find that out.",
        "Joshua: I wouldn't be too sure of that if I were you.",

        "Alison: Rafe? Rafe, it's me. Are you there?",
        "Alison: He should've been back by now from the yacht. That is if everything's ok.",

        "Captain: Wake up, bambino. Finito il pisolino. Time to get up.",
        "Rafe: What's going on?",
        "Captain: My boss wanted to make sure you were awake.",
        "Rafe: What for?",
        "Captain: The grand finale. The main event. Now we're going to find out if you can swim with those chains on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Why are you being so damned stubborn? I told you that I was going to help you and that you were not going to go through this alone, and you are not going through all of this alone.",
        "Ian: No, I will. I can, and I will.",
        "Lucy: No --",
        "Ian: You need to leave now.",
        "Lucy: What? I need -- what are you doing? If the situation was reversed, you wouldn't just leave me like this. I know you wouldn't. You wouldn't do that to me. So what's happened? The last time I was here, we -- you asked me if I would wait for you, and I said I would. I want to, so what has happened to that? What is wrong with -- what is wrong with your hand? What -- oh, my -- what happened?",
        "Ian: I was holding a bottle in my hand and I -- do you remember when we were in the park? And I was standing with you, you know, when Chris was learning to fly? And I was with you, and then I was over there with him, holding him with one hand, and I don't know where that strength came from. And I don't know where it went. And -- I don't know when it's coming back, and I can't control it.",
        "Lucy: Ok, but you're drinking the water. Does that help?",
        "Ian: I know I'm drinking the --",
        "[Lucy gasps]",
        "Ian: I can't stand the water! I can't stand the way it makes me feel because I can't focus on anything. I can't focus on my research, I can't be a doctor, and I -- I can't -- I can't find comfort in the woman I love because I'm afraid I'm going to crush her. So this is it for me. This is my life now. I'm trapped in here like an animal and I can't get out.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Hey, ok. You're right, you're right, you're right. Just -- what you need is to get out of here. You need a complete change. That's what you need.",
        "Ian: What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: Just -- here. Sit down. Sit down, just -- please, sit down. Hey. Can't you just try and listen to me, just for a minute, please?",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Ok. What I think you need right now is a change. I think you need a whole complete change of scenery.",
        "Ian: A change of scenery? Ahem. Well, that's perfect. That's -- no, you're right. I'm sorry, this is silly. You're right. That's what I said, change of scenery. And you know what? I'll go to the beach. A vampire on the beach, they love that. They do. No, I'm wrong. I should go to the mountains. Mountains are nice this time of year, especially. You know what I'll do? I'll build a tree house for myself. It'd be a nice place to live. Oh, you know, I don't have to build a tree house, because you know why? I have a cabin. I'll go there. I'll stay there.",
        "Lucy: Ok, can you stop? Are you done?",
        "Ian: I'm done.",
        "Lucy: Good. Because listen, the cabin a good idea. You need to leave here. You need to get as far away from Caleb as you can and still be able to get back if you have to. You get away from the hospital and away from all your responsibilities as a doctor. You get away from Kevin and all of that mess. You get away from everything, and you go up to the cabin, where it's peaceful. I mean, look at you. I can tell by the look on your face, you didn't even think of that idea, did you, now?",
        "Ian: No, I didn't.",
        "Lucy: Danny's ok, too. He's fine. He's in New York. Tim got him very safe. And the girls are fine. They're with Lee and Gail. So we're going to go up to that cabin and we're going to be fine. It'll be a whole complete change. It'll do us good.",
        "Ian: You know, part of that's a good idea.",
        "Lucy: I think it's a real good idea. You're just mad because you didn't think of it. And when we get there, I promise I'll make it better. I'll try. We'll make it better, ok?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Ok, so I'm going to go race and get my bag, and I will meet you back here.",
        "Ian: No -- no. That's not what we're doing.",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, that's not what we're doing?",
        "Ian: You're not coming with me. I'm going alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: And what makes you so sure they are brother and sister?",
        "Joshua: All the evidence speaks for itself. But what I do find puzzling is why she chose to lie to Stephen and myself about why she's on this trip.",
        "Elizabeth: Huh. Well, I guess you'll just have to stay puzzled.",
        "Joshua: Any more lies I should know about?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, actually, there is something, and I should tell you because you're going to find out anyway. We're plotting to overthrow the government.",
        "Joshua: I don't find you the slightest bit amusing.",
        "Elizabeth: You know, that's odd because I find you hilarious. What goes on in that measly little brain of yours?",
        "Joshua: There is only one thing in my mind and that is to do my job -- and that is to protect Stephen Clay.",
        "Elizabeth: Protect him from what? From Alison? From me? I mean, I know you don't approve of me, but --",
        "Joshua: Well, actually, the truth be told, in the beginning, by the time I got used to the fact you were going to marry him, I thought it would be a good thing. You might help him to forget.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, as usual, you were wrong.",
        "Joshua: No, but I am right when I say you've never been able to please a man.",
        "Elizabeth: What would you know about relationships? If I recall, you don't even have a life.",
        "Joshua: Ok. We can trade insults or we can take a break and have a drink.",
        "Elizabeth: No, thank you.",
        "Joshua: Oh, go on. Come on, please. You look as if you could use a stiff one.",
        "Elizabeth: On second thought, I'd love one.",
        "Joshua: I won't make it too strong.",
        "Elizabeth: No, don't worry. You're not going to make it at all. Knowing you, you'll put something in it if I'd give you half a chance.",
        "Joshua: Oh, what a shame. And I thought we were about to kiss and make up.",
        "Elizabeth: That'll be the day. Bottoms up.",
        "Joshua: As long as it's not yours. Cheers.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, wow. That -- that just tastes -- oh -- ugh -- ugh!",
        "Joshua: Oh, well. Time for bed, Elizabeth. You need to get your beauty rest, as if there are enough hours in the day. You know, you're almost attractive with your mouth closed. Has anyone ever told you that? Well, pretty soon, everything will be back to normal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rafe grunts]",
        "Rafe: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come on, we can make a deal, all right?",
        "Captain: You have nothing to offer me.",
        "Rafe: If you let me talk to you, I think we can work something out.",
        "Captain: Oh, stop it. Stop your whining. We all have to come to meet our end sometime, and your time --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "[Speaking Italian]",
        "Captain: Ok, now what? [Speaking Italian] Don't worry. Little problem on deck. I'm not forgetting about you.",
        "Rafe: Good, can't wait. Now all I have to do is figure out how to --",
        "Alison: Hey, hey. It's just me.",
        "Rafe: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Look, I got to figure out how to get you out of these chains.",
        "Rafe: Get out of here before that goon comes back!",
        "Alison: What has he done to you? He's -- they're not going to. I've tied them up for a little while. Now just let me figure out how to do this.",
        "[The captain approaches]",
        "Alison: They're back. They're here.",
        "Rafe: Alison, hurry. Ok, just go. Go.",
        "Alison: I don't know what to do. It's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: No. I am not letting you go up to the cabin, or anywhere else for that matter, by yourself, not alone.",
        "Ian: I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. Come on, if I'm going to figure this out, I'm going to have to do it on my own. I don't need a distraction, temptation. I -- you know I'm right about that.",
        "Lucy: No, no -- you know, you're not always right. I don't want you up there completely isolated, no.",
        "Ian: Why not?",
        "Lucy: I have to spell it out for you? Ok -- Elizabeth. You almost bit her. We both know that if you had bitten Elizabeth, you would have become a full- fledged --",
        "Ian: Become a full-fledged vampire, I know. I know. It's just another reason not to be around anybody. And plus, I'm drinking the water, so I'm not biting anyone.",
        "Lucy: What about when the water runs out?",
        "Ian: I'll call you. Ok? I need to do this alone.",
        "Lucy: I -- you know, I can understand that part, but I need -- I need to help you do it. I need to be with you. I -- I want to. And this isn't really about me this time, is it?",
        "Ian: No. Will you do me a favor?",
        "Lucy: Anything.",
        "Ian: Give me a ride up there.",
        "Lucy: See, that's a good idea because I can drive you up and help you get settled in --",
        "Ian: And then you'll come straight back.",
        "Lucy: If I leave you and come straight back, then how -- I mean, if you want to --",
        "Ian: I'll come back when I'm ready.",
        "Lucy: You'll call me?",
        "Ian: I promise.",
        "Lucy: Are you sure this is what you want?",
        "Ian: It is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, get ready when I say so.",
        "Sailor: Capitano, venga subito, e l'allarme.",
        "Captain: Ma abbiamo gia contorollato ogni cabina.",
        "[The captain walks away]",
        "Rafe: What the heck did you do?",
        "Alison: I did what I had to. I called the bridge and told them there was a fire. Then I went and smashed the alarm.",
        "Rafe: You what?",
        "Alison: I did! I just needed to keep -- make sure that they were looking for something, and they are, but we're going to run out of time really soon.",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right, you did your stuff. Thanks. Now can you go? Please?",
        "Alison: No! No, I won't leave you here!",
        "Rafe: Yes, yes, that's exactly what you're going to do. Ok? I can take care of myself. I'm fine.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah? You are? You don't look so fine to me.",
        "Rafe: I'm ok. This is where I want to be. Now, before I got knocked out, I heard that the captain is on Joshua's payroll.",
        "Alison: Joshua's?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And if he's on Joshua's payroll --",
        "Alison: Then that means that he's really working for Caleb. Wait, Rafe, my -- my father died on this yacht. He and my mother were -- were on this ship. Do you think that that means, then, that Joshua and Caleb killed my father?",
        "Rafe: Well, it -- it adds up.",
        "Alison: My God. But Caleb only came to Port Charles a short time ago. I mean, if what you're saying is really true, then --",
        "Rafe: It means that he was setting us up long before we even knew he was back.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "Rafe: Hey. I'm sorry, Alison. Look, it's going to be ok.",
        "Alison: Yeah --",
        "Rafe: All right? We are so close to getting what we want.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and we're going to be able to be together, just like you said.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Now, what I need you to do is go back to the hotel, lock the door, and don't let anybody in, all right? I'm staying here.",
        "Alison: But I can't --",
        "Rafe: No, no. No more buts, ok? Now, there's proof on this boat about you and me and about what happened to your father. I can sense it.",
        "Alison: Rafe, I cannot just leave you here.",
        "Rafe: Yes, you can. It's exactly what you're going to do. Now trust me. I got a plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: What are you saying, captain? No no, let the girl leave. She can come back here, and I will deal with her. Now I want you to take care of the other one and do it as quickly as possible. Yes, that's right -- kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Ooh.",
        "Ian: Oh -- I'm sorry. Did you get all the bags? I'm -- I was --",
        "Lucy: I got everything. I think I'm done. I did it. I'll help you unload this stuff. I'm glad you got the fire going. It is so cold out there.",
        "Ian: What are these?",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, what are those? Those are very expensive, delicious, yummy chocolates.",
        "Ian: Chocolates?",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ian: I thought you were just getting staples.",
        "Lucy: Uh-oh. You really don't believe that chocolate is a staple? Well, you're going to have to change your mind. Here -- try it.",
        "Ian: I like the white ones.",
        "Lucy: Oh, ok. I'll eat this one. You try that one. Mmm. Mmm, mine's better. Mmm. See? See? Ooh.",
        "Ian: It's perfect.",
        "Lucy: Yours is better.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Lucy: I don't think I can -- I mean, I have to do this, don't I? I got to go, so -- I don't want to leave you. I hate this more than you know. I feel like I'm abandoning you or something. Ok, so --",
        "Ian: Hmm?",
        "Lucy: You got everything you need, right?",
        "Ian: Well, I used to live in the jungle. I think I'll be fine if I run out of milk.",
        "Lucy: Ok. I -- I'm going to miss you. Be careful, ok? What is it? What's going on?",
        "Ian: Oh, no, I'm just a little shaky. I'm going to have some of Caleb's water.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",

        "Ian: Oh, my God.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Ian: The water's everywhere. It's --",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God! Wait a minute --",
        "Ian: The cold must've cracked them.",
        "Lucy: There has to be one that has something left.",
        "Ian: It's all gone, Lucy.",

        "Captain: All right, signore.",
        "Rafe: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You said I was going to learn how to swim. You didn't say anything about a gun.",
        "Captain: Change of plan.",
        "Rafe: A change?",
        "Captain: Yeah. I don't just throw you overboard. I shoot you first.",
        "Rafe: Huh. Shoot me?",
        "Captain: Yeah. Looks like the boss doesn't like you very much now come on. Let's go.",
        "Rafe: No, whoa, whoa, whoa! You know what? You don't want to do this. You don't want to do this.",
        "Captain: How do you Americans say -- come si dice? -- \"Want to bet?\"",
        "Rafe: I'll take that bet.",
        "Captain: What?",
        "Rafe: I'm not going anywhere, and you're not going to hurt anybody.",

        "Captain: And you're going to stop me how? Now move.",
        "Rafe: Nah, I don't feel like it. I tried to be nice about this.",
