        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Livvie: Hey. ",
        "Alison: What's going on? ",
        "Livvie: Nothing. I'm meeting Jack here. ",
        "Alison: Oh, you're -- you're still seeing him. ",
        "Livvie: And things are better than ever. ",
        "Alison: Well, even though he punched out his brother, landed himself in jail?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Come on, that's all over. He is out of jail, and we are even closer \r\nthan we were. ",
        "Alison: Close as in \"close, close?\" ",
        "Livvie: Well, we're getting there. Soon, I bet. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, don't you think you're moving a little bit fast on this? ",
        "Livvie: Maybe. I just -- I don't care anymore. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no, wait. I do not want to hear that. ",
        "Livvie: What? My life has been in, like, this holding pattern, and now I'm \r\ntired of it. I just want to move on now. ",
        "Alison: Then you're really sure about this. You think that Jack is really it?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Come on, it feels so right. How can that be wrong? ",
        "",
        "Jack's Voice: I used Livvie. I used her to get even with you. That's the \r\ntruth. That's why I came to Port Charles. ",
        "Chris: Livvie will hate him when she hears this. ",
        "Man: And you want that? ",
        "Chris: I want her. And since she knows your partner, I -- ",
        "Man: Yeah, Denny explained. That's why you wanted me. But I can't guarantee \r\nI'll deliver her to you. From what Denny tells me, she's pretty hot for your \r\nbrother. ",
        "Chris: Just let me worry about that. Your job is to set her up. ",
        "Man: Does this Livvie have a buddy? You know, a good girlfriend? ",
        "Chris: I like the way you think. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: So, what do you think? Do you -- do you like it? ",
        "Serena: Yeah, it looks a lot better than the hotel room that you were living \r\nin. ",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah. Come on, this is a lot better. Look at -- it's \r\nbeautiful. It's airy and it's big and spacious. That means I have more room for \r\nyou and your own room, and, you know, Livvie can come stay with us if she wants \r\nto. I just hope your daddy doesn't mind me hogging you more. ",
        "Serena: I'm so glad that you and my dad are still friends. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, me, too. You know, that will never, ever change, ever. ",
        "Serena: Yeah. So, some of my friends' parents, they act like they don't even \r\ncare about each other when they break up. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I know. That's a shame. Sweet pea, your daddy and me, we care about \r\neach other very, very, very much, but not half as much as we care about you. ",
        "Man: Where do you want this? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Oh, thank you. Put it upstairs, please, the first room on the left. \r\nThat'd be terrific, thanks. Oh. Oh, are you ok? Do you need some help? You got \r\nit? Ok! Hey, that goes against that wall right there, not too far, here. Oh, you \r\ngot it? Ok. Here, let me help you. All right, we got it. What do you think, \r\npolka dots? Pretty cute, huh? ",
        "Serena: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Perfect. Oh, that's great. Yep, just like that. Ok, there's more, \r\nthere's more. ",
        "Serena: What are you looking at? ",
        "Lucy: Oh -- nothing. You know, I'm still facing this big dilemma about \r\nwhether we need more paint, more colors, you know, or wallpaper. ",
        "Serena: Paint. ",
        "Lucy: Paint. You think paint? ",
        "Serena: Wallpaper's good, too. ",
        "Lucy: I'm going to really need your help decorating each and every inch of \r\nthis place. ",
        "Serena: Yeah, then we can have a big party afterwards. ",
        "Lucy: That's a great idea. We can have a big housewarming party, a big thing, \r\nbecause we haven't had a really good party in a very long time. ",
        "Serena: At least there's tomorrow. ",
        "Lucy: What's tomorrow? ",
        "Serena: Kevin and Eve renewing their vows? It is so cool that Eve's not dead \r\nand Kevin and Eve are back together. Don't you think? ",
        "",
        "Eve: What are you doing here? I -- are you back on staff? ",
        "Ian: No. I came to see a friend of mine. ",
        "Eve: Oh. A friend. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. She had an accident. ",
        "Eve: Is she ok? ",
        "Ian: Oh, no. She'll be fine. ",
        "Eve: Good. Is it anyone I know? ",
        "Ian: Well -- ",
        "Colleen: Excuse me, Ian -- ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Colleen: We need to take your patient down for an ultrasound. ",
        "Ian: Ok, why don't you get her ready, Colleen. Would you please? ",
        "Colleen: Ok, she's a little bit nervous. You think maybe you could go with \r\nher? ",
        "Ian: I will be with her every step of the way. ",
        "Colleen: Great, I'll tell her. ",
        "Eve: Your patient? I thought you said -- ",
        "Ian: No, it's -- it's Ramsey's patient. I'm not on staff. ",
        "Eve: Well, you didn't actually tell me. Was it -- is this anyone I know? ",
        "Ian: Well, it's a friend of mine. She's a long way from home, and she has \r\nsome problems with her family. So I'm just keeping an eye on her. ",
        "Eve: You're good at that. ",
        "Ian: If it's someone I care about. So anything else? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Yeah, sure. As a matter of fact, there is. I went back to Harris' \r\ncompound. ",
        "Ian: You did? Why? ",
        "Eve: Yesterday. ",
        "Ian: You all right? ",
        "Eve: Well, it was pretty scary being there again, but I guess that feeling \r\nwill never go away, considering what we went through there. ",
        "Ian: It wasn't all bad, Eve. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hey, sounds a little rough. ",
        "Jamal: Yo, what's up, boy? ",
        "Jack: What's up, bro? How you doing? ",
        "Jamal: Hey, good to see you out of cuffs. ",
        "Jack: You're not kidding. Getting to know the cops a little too well around \r\nhere. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: But that's going to change. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, wait. Let me guess. ",
        "Jack: Livvie. Yeah, Livvie. I'm supposed to meet her here, but I've got a \r\nminute. I can take a look at your bike if you want me to. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Actually, Alison's got her cornered there. So I think we got a \r\nlittle bit more than a minute. You know what I'm saying? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. So when did you get your bike fixed, bro? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, last night. ",
        "Jack: Why don't you ever get some of those turbo chargers? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, that doesn't work, man. This thing is way too old, man, \r\nyou know? ",
        "Jack: I used to have one, man. I can modify it for you if you want me to. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you ever even thought about getting hitched with a garage? I \r\nmean, come on. You got the experience. Come on. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I've got the record, too. Bosses don't actually like that. ",
        "Jamal: Don't I know. ",
        "Jack: You'll find something, bro. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you will too, man. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I've got to if I'm going to stay here in Port Charles. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: My dad walked in on us together on the bed. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no! ",
        "Livvie: I know. No, but it was totally cool. He was cool about it. I couldn't \r\nbelieve it. ",
        "Alison: Well, wait until he figures out that he's got a record. ",
        "Livvie: Look, Alison, I know you don't like Jack. ",
        "Alison: No, Livvie, it's not that. It's not -- ",
        "Livvie: Come on, you've been trying to get me away from him since the minute \r\nI got here. ",
        "Alison: I just -- I don't want him to hurt you, that's all. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, like Jamal hurt you? ",
        "Alison: No, he never hurt me. ",
        "Livvie: But that's what everybody thought was going to happen, right? Right?\r\n",
        "Alison: Ok. I get it. I see where you're going with this. ",
        "Livvie: Then don't be so worried about me. ",
        "Alison: Look, I hope that you're right about Jack. I really do. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, so do I because I think that maybe I'm falling in love \r\nwith him. ",
        "",
        "Serena: So I get to be in Kevin and Eve's wedding again. Isn't that sweet?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, yes. It's very sweet. Hey, listen, what about your room? Do you \r\nwant it decorated like an outdoorsy theme? We could do a big mural of trees and \r\na garden, maybe. What do you think? ",
        "Serena: Can you take me there? ",
        "Lucy: Where? To Kevin and Eve's? ",
        "Serena: Dad said he was going to have a really busy day tomorrow, and he said \r\nhe might not make it there until it starts. And I don't want to be late. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. Well, you know, pumpkin head, I don't know if I can make it.\r\n",
        "Serena: You're going to be late, too? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, no. I just mean I'm not sure I can, you know, even get there at \r\nall. ",
        "Serena: You're not going? ",
        "Lucy: Well, it's just -- look at this stuff. We have a lot to do. I have to \r\nfinish all this unpacking business. You know, a lot to do. ",
        "Serena: Kevin's going to be really disappointed. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, you know what? I will try, ok? For you, I'll try to make it, ok?\r\n",
        "Man: So, where do you want this? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Great! You know what? Take it out through that little gate out back \r\nthere. That'd be super. Thanks. ",
        "Serena: You're getting a dog, too? ",
        "Lucy: No, I don't need a dog! I have Sigmund. ",
        "Serena: Oh. You're sure he's really going to like that? ",
        "Lucy: Why wouldn't he? ",
        "Serena: Well, I think he's kind of got attached to the pond at the \r\nlighthouse. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, he'll get attached to this place. It's nice. ",
        "Serena: What if Kevin and Eve don't want to give him up? ",
        "Lucy: He is my duck. ",
        "Serena: Maybe you can work some sort of custody thing about, like you and Dad \r\ndid with me. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Yeah. Well, you know what? Let's just worry about that tomorrow, \r\nshall we? Listen, I have something we have to do right now that's very \r\nimportant. ",
        "Serena: What? What? What? What? ",
        "Lucy: All right, look, this is sort of a welcome to our new house and getting \r\nour new house ready for us, ok? Here, take this. All right, you know what these \r\nthings are? ",
        "Serena: What? ",
        "Lucy: Smudge sticks. You ever seen them? ",
        "Serena: Yeah! We studied these in school. ",
        "Lucy: Well, do you know what they do? I mean, Native Americans used them, and \r\nwhat they would do is that they'd use it kind of to change kind of the karma, \r\nmake the past go away, and get ready for a new life. Ok, you ready? ",
        "Serena: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: All right, we're going to light it. Be careful. This is dangerous, very \r\n-- so be very careful. You got it? Ok, now you wave it around and say, \"old \r\nenergy, begone.\" Right, old energy begone. Wave it all around. ",
        "Serena: Old energy, begone. ",
        "Lucy: Huh. ",
        "Serena: What's the matter with it? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. ",
        "Serena: Old energy, begone. ",
        "Lucy: I just -- I don't know. ",
        "Serena: Old energy, begone. ",
        "Lucy: Well, maybe these things are just a little damp. That's all -- damp. \r\nIt's damp. ",
        "Serena: Either that or there's stuff from your past that you're not supposed \r\nto get rid of. ",
        "",
        "Eve: So we had some good times, did we? Would that have been the time that \r\nHarris threw you up against the wall, or would that have been the time that you \r\nswallowed the poison and I wasn't sure whether you were going to live or die?\r\n",
        "Ian: When we weren't fighting for our lives, we worked pretty well together.\r\n",
        "Eve: But we were trying to save that creep. ",
        "Ian: And ourselves. I didn't want you to suffer. ",
        "Eve: I didn't want you to suffer, either. But I guess none of that matters \r\nnow, does it? ",
        "Ian: Must have mattered to you or you wouldn't have gone back. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: I wish I could have gone with you. ",

        "Eve: Yeah. I handled it. ",
        "Ian: And, what, did you fill in any blanks? ",
        "Eve: Yes, I did. ",

        "Alison: Oh, well, don't you want something to eat? ",
        "Man: I'd rather drink after a day like today. ",
        "Alison: Oh, it's that bad, huh? ",
        "Man: I know this kind of stuff happens to PIs all the time, but it's never \r\nhappened to me. ",
        "Alison: Oh, you're a detective? ",
        "Man: Yeah. I just had a client who stiffed me, for all the work I did for \r\nhim, too. I dug up a lot of good dirt. But doctors, they're the worst. ",
        "Alison: Your client's a doctor? ",
        "Man: Yeah, some bigwig over at General Hospital. I got the goods on his kid \r\nbrother for him, right? So what does he do? He blames me for bringing him the \r\nbad news. ",
        "Alison: His kid brother, huh? ",
        "Man: Mm-hmm. You know, I'm a little parched. You mind bringing my beer? ",

        "Jack: Yeah. ",

        "Livvie: Yeah. Look, I totally understand if you don't want to go. ",
