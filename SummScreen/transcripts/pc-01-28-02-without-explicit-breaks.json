        "ian: I asked you a question -- where'd you get that phone? ",
        "Ricky: It's none of your business, man. ",
        "Ian: I'm going to make it my business. It belongs to a friend of mine. ",
        "Gabriela: Ricky -- ",
        "ricky: Get out of my face, man. ",
        "Ian: Where's amy? ",
        "Gabriela: Ian, calm down. ",
        "Ricky: I don't know any amy chick. ",
        "Ian: Answer me! ",
        "Gabriela: Ian, stop it. You're going to kill him! ",
        "Ricky: Ok, ok. I found it, all right? I found the phone. ",
        "Kevin: No, I haven't found paige or any clues to where she might have gone. \r\nYou, either? All right. Well, keep looking, victor. Someone has to know where \r\nshe is. People don't just disappear into thin air, do they? ",
        "Rafe: Come on. You -- you have to tell us. Now, there are four of us but five \r\nchairs. So someone's got to be coming back with us, right? Someone's going to \r\ndie? ",
        "Ed: People die every day. ",
        "Rafe: Right, but this is different, isn't it? It's going to be someone who's \r\nclose to one of us. ",
        "Ed: You know, sometimes you're too smart for your own good, rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, so, who is it? Who's going to die? ",
        "Valerie: You're lying. Everything out of your mouth is a lie! ",
        "Jamal: No, I'm not, I'm not -- ",
        "valerie: She's poisoned you! ",
        "Jamal: No, valerie, no -- ",
        "valerie: Yes, she did! ",
        "Alison: No, don't! ",
        "[Gunshot] ",
        "[alison screams] ",
        "alison: Jamal! ",
        "Jack: Alison, stay down. ",
        "Alison: Jack, get off of me! ",
        "Jack: Stay down. ",
        "Alison: Get off of me! ",
        "Jack: Livvie, call an ambulance! ",
        "Alison: Jamal -- ",
        "jamal: Alison, stay down. ",
        "Alison: Jack, don't! ",
        "Jamal: Stay down! ",
        "Alison: Jamal! Get off of me. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, jamal. Are you ok? Are \r\nyou ok? It's going to be ok. Are you ok? Jamal. ",
        "Valerie: I'm hit. ",
        "Alison: Jamal. Oh, god. Are you ok? ",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc., And soapnet] ",
        "ian: No. I don't think you found this phone. I think you took it from her. \r\nWhere is amy -- ",
        "gabriela: Ian, you're going to hurt him! ",
        "Ian: Before i break your neck! ",
        "Gabriela: He's my brother! ",
        "Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa -- whoa, ian. What's going on here? ",
        "Ian: Amy is missing, and this clown's got her phone. You do the math. ",
        "Ricky: I keep telling this lunatic that i don't know where his girlfriend is \r\nand I found the phone. ",
        "Kevin: Let's just back up, ok? Gabby, this is your brother? ",
        "Gabriela: Yes, and i believe him. ",
        "Ian: Well, I don'T. ",
        "Gabriela: Ian, he should have turned the phone in, but he would never do \r\nanything to hurt your friend! ",
        "Ian: And how do we know that? ",
        "Kevin: Wait, wait, wait! Let's just think about this for a minute, ok? Look, \r\nif he'd done something to amy, why would he hang on to her phone? ",
        "Ian: Why wouldn't he? ",
        "Kevin: Well, that would make him about the dumbest mugger in the world, \r\nwouldn't it? ",
        "Ian: That's my point. ",
        "Ricky: You know what? Go to hell. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, hey -- let's just concentrate on finding amy, all right? Where'd \r\nyou find that phone? ",
        "Ricky: In the park. ",
        "Ian: If you're lying, i swear to god -- ",
        "kevin: Just let's -- let's take a breather, ok? Come on. Ian -- isn't it \r\npossible amy just lost her phone? ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "Kevin: Why not? It happens all the time. ",
        "Ian: She's blind, kevin. It's her lifeline. She's probably dead in some ditch \r\nsomewhere. ",
        "Kevin: Wait -- whoa, whoa. That's being a little dramatic, don't you think?\r\n",
        "Ian: Maybe so, but I don't trust this kid. ",
        "Kevin: Fine. Don't trust him. All I'm saying is that there could be a logical \r\nexplanation. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Now, your friend paige -- you haven't heard from her, have you?\r\n",
        "Kevin: No, but what does that have to do with -- ",
        "ian: Maybe he has something to do with that as well. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's making quite a leap, don't you think? ",
        "Ian: Is it? Two people have disappeared. They're just missing. Doesn't make \r\nyou wonder? ",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, if you can't tell us who's going to die, can you at least tell \r\nus when it's going to happen? ",
        "Ed: You'll know. ",
        "Rafe: We'll know. ",
        "What is that supposed to mean? ",
        "Ed: It means that you'll all be helping this person cross over. ",
        "Casey: Whoa. ",
        "Amy: I'm not sure i'm ready to do that. ",
        "Paige: I think I could do that, if that's the job. ",
        "Ed: All right. ",
        "Rafe: What -- ",
        "ed: No more questions. You know all you need to know for now. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, right, except who is going to die and if it's someone that's \r\nclose to one of us. ",
        "Ed: Rafe, my boy, it is not easy being an angel. The jobs we do are very \r\ntough. But sometimes we're called upon to make it easier for people. ",
        "Rafe: All I'm saying, if it's a friend, then i just think that -- ",
        "ed: Ok, that's enough. You should all be concentrating on getting back down \r\nagain and covering yourselves because you've been missing long enough as it is.\r\n",
        "Casey: Good, because this is just way too heavy. ",
        "Ed: Also, remember what i told you -- every choice you make affects other \r\nlives. So make that choice carefully. ",
        "Rafe: Whoa. Are you saying that we could have something to do with this \r\ndeath? ",
        "Ed: Don't start putting words in my mouth, rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Well, what are you saying? Are you saying that we could stop it? Is \r\nthat it? What? ",
        "Ed: You have all been allowed to be human again. And as any other human, you \r\ncan't possibly know the future. You live the time you have, and you try to \r\ncomplete your journeys the best you can, and that's it. So, good luck. ",
        "Rafe: Well, it's just you and me now, ed. What is it you're not telling me?\r\n",
        "Ed: Are you sure you really want to know? ",
        "Valerie: Oh, god, it hurts, jamal. It hurts. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, look, valerie, help is on the way, ok? Just -- just hold on, \r\nvalerie, ok? ",
        "[Sirens approach] ",
        "jamal: Shh. ",
        "Valerie: I just wanted to make a family with you, that's all. That's all, \r\njamal. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, just -- look, just save your strength. You got to pull through \r\nthis, valerie. Ok, you got to pull -- ",
        "jack: Frank, right in here. ",
        "Frank: Jack, what's going on? ",
        "Jack: It's valerie. ",
        "Frank: Valerie's the gunshot victim? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I applied pressure to the wound, but she's lost a lot of blood.\r\n",
        "Frank: What happened? ",
        "Alison: Valerie, she -- she brought a gun here. ",
        "Frank: Why? ",
        "Alison: She wanted to kill me, but she got shot instead accidentally. ",
        "Frank: What's her rate? ",
        "Paramedic: 148 and thready. ",
        "Frank: All right, let's get her out of here. We're losing her. ",
        "Paramedic: All right, let's go. ",
        "Frank: Come on. ",
        "Paramedic: Let's go. Come on, valerie. You're moving, all right? ",
        "Alison: Jamal? ",
        "Livvie: Ok, val. ",
        "Frank: Let's go, let's go. ",
        "Paramedic: Let's go. ",
        "Frank: On two, three. ",
        "Jack: Frank, i got this. ",
        "Frank: All right. You go. ",
        "Ison: Ok, can we come? Livvie, you got my coat? Do you have -- ",
        "jack: Come on, come on. ",
        "Livvie: I got it, I got it! ",
        "ricky: Who is that jerk anyway?And why does everybody in this when something\r\n",
        "gabriela: You stole that woman's phone. ",
        "Ricky: I told you i didn't steal it. I found it. ",
        "Gabriela: And kept it? ",
        "Ricky: I was going to give it back. ",
        "Gabriela: Why did you tell me amanda barrington gave it to you? ",
        "Ricky: Because I knew that you were going to think that i was lying. I would \r\nsay I found the phone, and then you'd give me that look like \"yeah, right.\" ",
        "Gabriela: Do you ever just say \"yeah, i was wrong\"? ",
        "Ricky: No, not when i didn't do anything. ",
        "Gabriela: You're never going to change. I don't even know why you came back \r\nhere. ",
        "Ricky: I came back here to be with my family -- to be with you, gigi. You \r\nknow, when i was locked up like -- like some animal, all I thought about was \r\ngetting out, being part of my family again. You know, but you're right. Maybe I \r\nmade a mistake. I should've known I couldn't get a fresh start here. ",
        "Gabriela: You can, and we want you to, but you've got to earn people's trust, \r\nricky. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, how am i supposed to do that, huh, when everybody thinks \r\nthe worst even before I open my mouth? ",
        "Gabriela: That is not true. ",
        "Ricky: I mean, even -- even mom, emilio -- you, gigi. The minute that I set \r\nfoot in this town, everybody was wondering what i was up to. Well, you know \r\nwhat? I'm going to do everybody a favor. I'm out of here. ",
        "Kevin: Ian, i don't have any reason to believe that gabby's brother is a \r\nserial killer. ",
        "Ian: Two women are missing. He had amy's phone. ",
        "Kevin: But I don't know that paige is actually missing. Frankly, i think she \r\njust took off and didn't say anything. ",
        "Ian: Why would she do that? ",
        "Kevin: Long story short, lucy started poking around in her past. And then i \r\njumped on the bandwagon -- stupid. I think paige just didn't want to stick \r\naround for an inquisition. ",
        "Ian: Well, I had some questions for amy as well. Guess those two ladies had \r\nsome secrets. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, you could say that. I found paige's passport. It expired years \r\nago. ",
        "Ian: She came here from england on an expired passport? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, with security the way it is nowadays, that doesn't seem \r\npossible, does it? ",
        "Ian: Something's not right here. Now, i don't know about paige, but I'm \r\npretty sure that amy didn't leave by choice. Now, he said he found the phone in \r\nthe park. I'm going to check it out. ",
        "Kevin: Their disappearance couldn't be connected. Or could they? ",
        "Casey: Man, does it feel great to be back! You know, I could -- i could kiss \r\nthis ground. ",
        "Amy: I'ad to be back, too, but we got even more problems than before. ",
        "Paige: Yeah, and even more pressure. ",
        "Casey: Oh, jeez. Don't the two of you guys ever lighten up? ",
        "Paige: Look, casey, i know i've said this before, but we have got to make \r\nsure that nobody finds out how we're connected. ",
        "Amy: Or we're all going to get yanked back. ",
        "Paige: Yeah, and this time that we've been away isn't going to help. ",
        "Amy: I don't know how i'm going to explain a missing shift at the hospital.\r\n",
        "Paige: Oh, god. And kevin's probably been wondering where I've been. ",
        "Casey: Look, if we're going to get yanked back, it's going to be because of \r\nyou guys, all these people you got involved with. ",
        "Paige: We've all got damage control to do, casey. ",
        "Casey: Nope, not me. See, i got no attachments. ",
        "Amy: Ed said someone close to one of us is going to die. He didn't say \r\n\"except for casey.\" ",
        "Casey: He didn't have to. He wasn't talking to me. ",
        "Paige: How do you know that? ",
        "Casey: Because there's no one close to me. Nobody cares about me, there's no \r\none i care about, and I'm keeping it like that. I'm out of here. ",
        "Paige: Yeah, I should get going, too. ",
        "Amy: Wait. You don't seem at all interested in who's going to die, who's \r\ngoing to fill that fifth chair. ",
        "Paige: Well, like ed said, people die every day. ",
        "Amy: But not someone close to one of us. ",
        "Paige: Look, ed made it very clear he was not going to tell us. I accept \r\nthat. ",
        "Amy: Just like that? ",
        "Paige: All right, amy. What are you getting at? ",
        "Amy: I think you know who's going to die. ",
        "Paige: And why would you say something like that? ",
        "Amy: You were the only one who said to ed, \"yeah, i'll act as someone's guide \r\nto the other side.\" You almost sound anxious to be the one. I think I know why \r\nyou're here -- to take kevin collins back with you. ",
        "Paige: You really are crazy. ",
        "Amy: No. You begged to come down here and spend this time with him. But \r\nthat's not all you wanted. You want to spend eternity with him. ",
        "Paige: Just because you're blind, you think that gives you the right to make \r\nsuch outrageous statements. ",
        "Amy: When i lost my sight, paige, i didn't lose my ability to see the truth.\r\n",
        "Paige: Good-bye, amy. ",
        "Ed: Your friend's in trouble. ",
        "Rafe: Alison? ",
        "Ed: Yes. ",
        "Rafe: Oh -- no. She's not the one coming back with us. She can't be. I want \r\nher to live a long and happy life. ",
        "Ed: Maybe she will, rafe. ",
        "Rafe: \"Maybe she will.\" ",
        "What is that supposed to mean? ",
        "Ed: It's all i can tell you right now. ",
        "Rafe: And you know what? It's never enough. And don't stand there and tell me \r\nthat everything happens for a reason! This is something I want to know! I want \r\nto know right now! What is going to happen to alison? ",
        "Ed: I can't show you her future, rafe. Maybe I can show you something -- \r\nwhat's happening to her right now. ",
        "Chris: Call the o.R. Call the blood bank. We need four units of o-neg. ",
        "Frank: All right, one, two, three. ",
        "Karen: Ok, t a B.P., Start dopamine, titrate to systolic of 100. ",
        "Jamal: Frank. ",
        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Frank, how is she? We got her in time, right? How is she? ",
        "Frank: Well, she's still alive, so there's a chance. ",
        "Alison: Oh, thank god. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, good. I got to see her. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Andy: Hey, jamal, look -- I need to ask you some questions about what \r\nhappened. Now, we know valerie escaped from the psychiatric ward. ",
        "Jamal: I shot her. ",
        "Jack: No, no -- ",
        "livvie: Jamal, no, you didn't. ",
        "Alison: No, listen, you didn't. It was an accident. ",
        "Jack: We walked in, and valerie had a gun on alison. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: That's what happened. ",
        "Andy: She was threatening you? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, she was, like, blaming me for all of her problems, and she said \r\nthat she was going to take the one person that jamal loved the most away from \r\nhim. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, we heard her, too. We walked in when she was ck:We tried to get \r\nthe gun at's when the shot went off. ",
        "Livvie: Detective, it was an accident. It was. ",
        "Jack: A complete accident. ",
        "Andy: All right, all right. Is this true, jamal? ",
        "Livvie: Jamal. ",
        "Karen: She's in v-fib. ",
        "Chris: Come on. ",
        "Karen: Get the paddles. ",
        "Chris: Charging. ",
        "Rafe: My god. Valerie tried to kill alison. And now valerie might die. So it \r\n-- is she the one? Is she going to fill the fifth chair? ",
        "Ed: No. No, valerie's taking another journey. But this will affect alison -- \r\nher destiny and yours. ",
        "Rafe: How? ",
        "Ed: Well, that's for you to decide, kid. If you want to go right back there \r\nnow, do it. Or i'll grant you your wish -- you can stay up here in heaven, if \r\nthat's what you truly want. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm sorry if i've been one of those people who's jumped to \r\nconclusions about you. I just worry because i love you. And I don't want \r\nanything to happen that takes you away from me again. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I know. ",

        "gabriela: They're paging me. ",
        "Ricky: It's ok. ",
        "Gabriela: No, it's not ok. We have a lot to talk about. I am not letting you \r\nleave like this. ",
        "Ricky: Ok. We'll talk. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. Bye. ",
        "Ricky: Sorry, gigi. I got nothing more to say. I don't belong here. And this \r\nis my ticket out of here -- ricky barrington. ",
        "Frank: Casey! Hey! ",
        "Casey: Where's the fire, frank? ",
        "Frank: I was about to drive off when i saw you across the street. Where have \r\nyou been? ",
        "Casey: Look, man, i'm back for my shift. That's all you need to worry about.\r\n",
        "Frank: Ease off the smart mouth, ok? ",
        "Casey: Whatever. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, uh-uh-uh -- you listen to me. I checked with a friend of mine \r\nfrom children's services. ",
        "Casey: Oh, how sweet, frank. You want to adopt me! ",
        "Frank: You disappeared from the system 10 months ago. Where did you go? ",
        "Casey: I died and went to heaven. ",
        "Frank: Not funny. ",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, neither is being treated like a child. Look, I'm an adult \r\nnow, ok, pops? Yeah, I turned 18. ",
        "Frank: You were supposed to report to a shelter that was going to get you set \r\nup. ",
        "Casey: So i decided i could take care of myself. What's with this drill \r\nsession? ",
        "Frank: I was worried, ok? I care about you. ",
        "Casey: Don't, ok? I don't want you caring about me. ",
        "Frank: What? ",
        "Casey: Look, I'm only working at your place and crashing at your pad because \r\nI have to, all right? But I don't care about you, and I don't want you or \r\nanybody else giving a damn about me. You got it? ",
        "Frank: Sorry, but you don't get to decide who I care about. ",
        "[Car horn honks] ",
        "frank: Now, look, i've got to go. Find a warmer coat. There's a storm coming.\r\n",
        "Casey: Man, just leave me alone! You can't start caring about me, frank, or \r\nsomething bad could happen to you. ",
        "Amy: I know i dropped my phone here somewhere. ",
        "Ian: Amy? What are you doing here? What happened? Are you all right? ",
        "Amy: I'm not hurt, ian, if that's what you're worried about. I'm ju looking \r\nfor my phone. ",
        "Ian: Your -- your phone? You lost your phone? ",
        "Amy: Yeah, around here, I think. ",
        "Ian: Well, some kid found it, and I -- i got it now. ",
        "Amy: Oh. Good. ",
        "Ian: \"Good\"? No, no, no, it's not good. I almost -- I tore his head off. ",
        "Amy: Why? ",
        "Ian: Here. Why? Well, because you were missing, you didn't show up for work, \r\nand he had your phone. I thought maybe you were hurt or in a ditch or something.\r\n",
