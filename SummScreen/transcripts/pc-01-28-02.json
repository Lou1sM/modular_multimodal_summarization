", "Gabriela: Why did you tell me amanda barrington gave it to you? ", "Ricky: Because I knew that you were going to think that i was lying. I would say I found the phone, and then you'd give me that look like \"yeah, right.\" ", "Gabriela: Do you ever just say \"yeah, i was wrong\"? ", "Ricky: No, not when i didn't do anything.

", "Kevin: But I don't know that paige is actually missing. Frankly, i think she just took off and didn't say anything. ", "Ian: Why would she do that? ", "Kevin: Long story short, lucy started poking around in her past. And then i jumped on the bandwagon -- stupid. I think paige just didn't want to stick around for an inquisition. ", "Ian: Well, I had some questions for amy as well. Guess those two ladies had some secrets. ", "Kevin: Yeah, you could say that. I found paige's passport. It expired years ago. ", "Ian: She came here from england on an expired passport? ", "Kevin: Yeah, well, with security the way it is nowadays, that doesn't seem possible, does it? ", "Ian: Something's not right here. Now, i don't know about paige, but I'm pretty sure that amy didn't leave by choice. Now, he said he found the phone in the park. I'm going to check it out.

", "Paige: Yeah, and this time that we've been away isn't going to help. ", "Amy: I don't know how i'm going to explain a missing shift at the hospital.", "Paige: Oh, god. And kevin's probably been wondering where I've been. ", "Casey: Look, if we're going to get yanked back, it's going to be because of you guys, all these people you got involved with. ", "Paige: We've all got damage control to do, casey. ", "Casey: Nope, not me. See, i got no attachments. ", "Amy: Ed said someone close to one of us is going to die. He didn't say \"except for casey.\" ", "Casey: He didn't have to. He wasn't talking to me. ", "Paige: How do you know that? ", "Casey: Because there's no one close to me. Nobody cares about me, there's no one i care about, and I'm keeping it like that. I'm out of here. ", "Paige: Yeah, I should get going, too. ", "Amy: Wait. You don't seem at all interested in who's going to die, who's going to fill that fifth chair. ", "Paige: Well, like ed said, people die every day. ", "Amy: But not someone close to one of us. ", "Paige: Look, ed made it very clear he was not going to tell us. I accept that. ", "Amy: Just like that? ", "Paige: All right, amy. What are you getting at? ", "Amy: I think you know who's going to die. ", "Paige: And why would you say something like that? ", "Amy: You were the only one who said to ed, \"yeah, i'll act as someone's guide to the other side.\" You almost sound anxious to be the one. I think I know why you're here -- to take kevin collins back with you. ", "Paige: You really are crazy. ", "Amy: No. You begged to come down here and spend this time with him. But that's not all you wanted. You want to spend eternity with him. ", "Paige: Just because you're blind, you think that gives you the right to make such outrageous statements. ", "Amy: When i lost my sight, paige, i didn't lose my ability to see the truth.", "Paige: Good-bye, amy. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Your friend's in trouble. ", "Rafe: Alison? ", "Ed: Yes.

", "Rafe: \"Maybe she will.\" ", "What is that supposed to mean? ", "Ed: It's all i can tell you right now. ", "Rafe: And you know what? It's never enough. And don't stand there and tell me that everything happens for a reason! This is something I want to know! I want to know right now! What is going to happen to alison?
