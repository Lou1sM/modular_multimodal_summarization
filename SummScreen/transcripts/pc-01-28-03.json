        "Kevin realizes he shouldn't be surprised to see Ian at the cabin with Lucy. This is familiar territory, since Lucy wouldn't be the first wife Ian stole from him. Kevin apologizes to Lucy for the horrible way he's been treating her. He loves her and wants to be with her. He decides to wait for her in the car, and if she doesn't come to him, he'll never bother her again. Ian is stunned when she chooses to follow her husband, but he's overjoyed when she returns with the news that she left Kevin for him. After having Reese's film developed, Marissa is shocked to see photos proving that Caleb and Reese are vampires. Caz and Reese confront her, and while Marissa tries to talk her way out of this, they're determined to kill her in order to avoid Caleb's wrath. Marissa is saved when her twin sister--her very own guardian angel--falls from the sky and stops the vampires in their tracks.",
        "Alison and Elizabeth hide Joshua's body in Alison's room before opening the door to Caleb. They pretend to have been arguing about him, and Alison bawls him out for sending Joshua along on the trip. She makes up a story about how Joshua abandoned them, and Caleb promises to check into it. When Elizabeth informs her husband that she's leaving him, he responds by taking her to bed. Moments after Rafe finds the corpse, Alison returns and fills him in on what happened. He informs her that if her mother really did kill Joshua, there's no turning back; she's lost her soul and is now a full-fledged vampire. Rafe promises to protect Elizabeth to the best of his ability. While he gets rid of Joshua's body, Alison checks on her mother and finds her in bed with Caleb. Devastated, she would like nothing more than to find comfort in Rafe's arms, but it's not possible until they have proof that he's not her brother. Rafe is very happy to inform her that they have the proof they need. He shows her some authentic papers from her father's journal, and they prove that Malcolm's other child is a girl."

        "Kevin: Boy, I'd better get my ego in check. I thought you came all the way up here to think about us.",
        "Lucy: Look, I came up here because --",
        "Kevin: There's no explanation for what I just walked in on.",
        "Ian: That's right, talk right over her.",
        "Kevin: Don't try to make me the bad guy, Ian, not after you've been mooning over Lucy for months.",
        "Ian: I'm in love with her.",
        "Kevin: Aw. And the fact that she's married means nothing to you?",
        "Ian: No. You haven't been a husband to Lucy for a very long time, and I'm not going to let her go without a fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ok. Are you ok?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, I'm fine. Alison, you got to get out of here. Just go.",
        "Alison: No, no. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Caleb: Elizabeth?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Alison: Listen to me. I am not going anywhere. Now, take a very deep breath, relax. If you look nervous, he's going to be suspicious. Ok? You all right?",
        "Caleb: What is going on? I was knocking forever.",
        "Elizabeth: Hi. What a surprise.",
        "Caleb: A pleasant one, I hope.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah.",
        "Alison: No, actually, everything's not ok here. Why don't you tell him what's going on.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison --",
        "Alison: No. Tell him. Tell him about it. We're having a fight, and it's about you. See, I am upset because if you really wanted to send a chaperone along, why didn't you just come along yourself?",
        "Caleb: I would have loved to have come.",
        "Alison: Hmm.",
        "Caleb: But I had band rehearsal.",
        "Alison: You'd rather do band rehearsal than spend some time with your new bride?",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, his work's very important to him.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sure it is very important -- whoo! -- Very important. Thanks a lot for sending Mr. Excitement along.",
        "Caleb: You're talking about Joshua. Yeah, he can get on your nerves sometimes.",
        "Alison: And he's unreliable.",
        "Caleb: Well, I'll just have to have a talk with him, won't I? Do you know where he is?",
        "Alison: No. He was supposed to get us tickets for some stupid concert that I didn't really want go to anyway. But yet we just sat here waiting for him.",
        "Caleb: Ok. When was the last time either one of you saw him?",
        "Alison: Earlier, like breakfast.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, this morning.",
        "Caleb: Well, I'm just going to have find him, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison, where are you? What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marissa: Ok, Reese. Let's see if you're hiding anything. Oh, my God. Jamal was right. Stephen is a vampire. They're all vampires.",
        "Reese: What you got there, scoop?",
        "Caz: Can we see?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Well, this has the ring of the familiar to it, doesn't it? You stealing a wife of mine.",
        "Ian: You drove her away, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, as you waited for the first sign of trouble.",
        "Ian: You tried to kill her.",
        "Kevin: You set this up, didn't you?",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, you got her stranded out here, right?",
        "Lucy: Ian did not set this up, Doc.",
        "Ian: No, we didn't plan this. We're not going to hide the way we feel about each other.",
        "Kevin: \"The way we feel about each other\"? Feelings usually take a little time to develop, don't they? You sure you know how she really feels?",
        "Ian: She's here because she wants to be.",
        "Kevin: In the moment, sure. Don't kid yourself, Ian. In the end, Lucy and I will always belong to each other.",
        "Ian: Are you blind, man?",
        "Lucy: Ok, just stop. Just listen to me for a minute. I can't -- I can't have you tearing at each other. I know exactly what I want, and it's time both of you did, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Well, isn't like Joshua to just disappear.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe not, but, you know, it was very annoying.",
        "Elizabeth: We just thought he just took off, just left us.",
        "Caleb: Just left you two here?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I guess if we were really concerned or nice, we could have looked for him a little sooner.",
        "Caleb: No idea where he could be?",
        "Elizabeth: No. Uh-uh.",
        "Alison: No. No. Oh. The waitress.",
        "Elizabeth: Yes, at breakfast. The one who was flirting with him, that tall one, the blonde one.",
        "Alison: Uh-huh.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, he could have -- yeah.",
        "Alison: Yeah, he looked like maybe he liked her, and we said that if he could leave us alone for a little bit --",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, because it's just difficult being here where Malcolm died and we needed some time, but --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: Of course. It must be a very difficult time for both of you.",
        "Alison: It's very hard. And I think that's why you and I have been going at each other so much --",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Yeah, at each other's throat and being so upset. I'm really sorry, mom.",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, too.",
        "Caleb: Well, I guess I should also say I'm sorry for the way we parted, and we can talk more about that as soon as I track Joshua down.",
        "Elizabeth: Uh -- no. I think we should talk now, Stephen. Alison, could you leave us alone just for a minute, please?",
        "Alison: Well, I'll just be in my room.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok. Thank you, sweetheart. Oh, I love you so much.",
        "Alison: I love you, too. Ahem. Ok.",
        "Caleb: It's been a while since we've been alone. Come here.",
        "Elizabeth: This is very difficult for me, Stephen. I'm just really tired of all these ups and downs. I mean, sometimes you are just so sweet and loving, and then you turn around and you're cold and cruel.",
        "Caleb: The temperament of an artist.",
        "Elizabeth: I know, that may be true, but it's not working for me. I'm leaving you, Stephen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Alison. Thank God you're ok.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Oh. Hi. I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Rafe: Did you know about this?",
        "Alison: Yeah. It happened right in front of me.",
        "Rafe: Did your mother do this?",
        "Alison: Joshua figured out what we were up to and he started to attack me. And then my mother, she just came up and attacked Joshua, and that's when she did it, that's when she bit him.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: She killed him.",
        "Rafe: I'm so sorry I wasn't here.",
        "Alison: Rafe, my mother, she saved me. She protected me the only way that she really knew how.",
        "Rafe: I'm just glad you're ok.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm worried about her right now.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Right.",
        "Alison: What? What is it?",
        "Rafe: Oh, it's -- I'm just making sure.",
        "Alison: He is dead, isn't he?",
        "Rafe: Well, he definitely has no pulse. It's just --",
        "Alison: Just what? What is it? Tell me.",
        "Rafe: Well, your mother is a vampire.",
        "Alison: I know, but it's not like she killed for pleasure or anything like that.",
        "Rafe: I am so grateful to her because she saved you. It's just that if she did kill Joshua --",
        "Alison: Wait, what do you mean, \"if she did\"? You said that there was no pulse.",
        "Rafe: It's just that, see, when a vampire makes their first blood kill, they cross over.",
        "Alison: They cross over? What do you mean?",
        "Rafe: Your mother -- she's lost her soul. She's a full-fledged vampire now.",
        "Alison: No. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I said I'm leaving you. Aren't you going to say something, do something? No, don't. If you think that you can just --",
        "Caleb: What? What? Want to be close to you? Want to make love to you?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, God. Ah. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You know what, Lucy? Don't say anything for a minute. I need a moment with you.",
        "Ian: I'm not going to leave her alone with you.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, whatever, ok? Suit yourself. You know, he is right about one thing. I did drive you away. This is my fault. My behavior has been unforgivable. And I've been grieving my daughter, but that's no excuse for the way that I've acted or for some of the things I've said. You tried to help me, Lucy, and I pushed you away, and you will never know how sorry I am for that. But I hope you know how much I do love you. I know I haven't been a very good husband lately, and I don't want to lose you, Lucy, or the things that we have together. You don't have to say anything.",
        "Lucy: But, Doc --",
        "Kevin: No, please just -- don't. I'm going to go. I'm going to sit in the car and wait for a few minutes. And if you don't come out, then I'll leave, and I won't bother you again.",
        "Ian: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marissa: These are mine. They're actually none of your business.",
        "Reese: Really? Because they looked like my pictures, didn't they, Caz?",
        "Caz: Yeah, they did.",
        "Reese: Which means you stole from me, invaded my privacy, and know way too much for your own good.",
        "Marissa: Well, actually, I've already copied these and I've sent them to the paper.",
        "Reese: Oh, is that why you were surprised when you just looked at them?",
        "Marissa: You know what -- I'm not scared of you, Reese -- I'm not -- because you can't do anything without Stephen.",
        "Reese: Oh, you see, that's the problem. Stephen doesn't know we took those pictures.",
        "Caz: And if he finds out, we're dead.",
        "Marissa: Dead? But I thought you guys were already dead.",
        "Caz: No, you don't know much about vampires, now, do you?",
        "Reese: Oh, she's just a silly little mort, Caz. You're not very bright, are you? Stephen could drive a stake into our hearts, cut off our --",
        "Marissa: Ok, ok, ok! I get the picture.",
        "Reese: So you understand it's pretty easy decision. You die instead of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This is all because of me.",
        "Rafe: No, no, this is not your fault.",
        "Alison: Yes, it is. This is all my fault. My mother lost her life because she was trying to protect mine. Now she's going to be a vampire forever.",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, listen to me first. There's nothing you could have done. Now, listen to me. Given that choice again, your mother would have done exactly the same thing. She was just trying to protect her daughter.",
        "Alison: I know, I know. We need to protect her now. She's in there with Caleb right now.",
        "Rafe: Caleb's --",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you're right. We have to try to protect her.",
        "Alison: She's telling him that she's going to leave him.",
        "Rafe: Do you think she can do that?",
        "Alison: I think she can. This time she really wants to leave him. She wants to get away from him.",
        "Rafe: But once she's alone with him --",
        "Alison: No, no, she won't. She won't give in this time. But we cannot let Caleb figure out what she's done to Joshua. There's no telling what he would do to her if he'd figured this out.",
        "Rafe: Don't worry. I'll take care of this.",
        "Alison: Is there any way that you can, like -- I don't know -- make him disappear or something?",
        "Rafe: Oh, wish I could, for more reasons than one.",
        "Alison: What do you mean by that?",
        "Rafe: Oh, never mind. Look, I saw something out in the hallway. I think I can cart my way in, so I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: Wait, Rafe! What if somebody sees you?",
        "Rafe: It's fine.",
        "Alison: Be careful. Please be ok. No matter how many awful, horrible things that you've done, I promise I'll help you, and we will make everything ok, I promise. Just please, please, please be ok. Ok. Are we really doing this?",
        "Rafe: No, just turn around. I don't want you any more involved in this than you already are. Please?",
        "Rafe: Ugh. Ok. Now, I want you to listen to me very closely, all right? I'm going to take care of this. I won't be gone long. Now, I don't want you to go into your mother's room. I don't even want you to go out in the hallway. Just stay right here, lock the door, and whoever comes to the door, you don't answer it, all right?",
        "Alison: What if somebody sees you?",
        "Rafe: They won't. I'll be fine.",
        "Alison: Cover his shoes!",
        "Rafe: It'll be fine. Open the door, open the door.",
        "Alison: Be careful, be careful.",
        "Rafe: It'll be ok. I love you.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. I cannot even believe we are doing this. Oh, mom, please be ok in there. You should have been out by now. It shouldn't take that long. Oh, my God, what if he's done something to you? What if he's done something awful to you in there? I should never have left you alone. I'm so stupid.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Stephen.",
        "Alison: No. No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marissa: Guys, stop. You know, I know you guys are just upset. You're upset because I saw the pictures. I saw them, but, you know what? I'll toss them. I'll toss them and I won't tell a soul that I saw them, I promise, I swear.",
        "Reese: I'm tired of her chirping, Caz. Come here, songbird.",
        "Marissa: No. You guys, please -- please stop!",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Marissa: Wha-- at the --",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Casey: Ah! Ow. It's not funny, Ed! He could have shown me an easier way to get down here.",
        "Marissa: Casey.",
        "Casey: Ha! Your guardian sister. And I got three words to say to you -- what the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I told him I was staying. I want to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You missed a button.",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you.",
        "Caleb: My pleasure.",
        "Elizabeth: Now, what just happened here doesn't change anything.",
        "Caleb: I wasn't trying to change anything, sweetheart. I just wanted you to know what you were leaving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Hey. What's going on? What are you doing down here? What happened?",
        "Alison: I saw them. I saw my mother and I saw Caleb and --",
        "Rafe: I told you not to go in there.",
        "Alison: I know. I didn't. I just -- I peeked in the door and I saw them and -- and -- I don't know.",
        "Rafe: What? What?",
        "Alison: I just know. I mean, I know now that no matter how many times she says that she wants to escape him, she's never going to be able to.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: And what makes this so much worse is that I want to do just that-- I want to go into your arms, I want to melt there.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Alison: I'm tired, and I can't because there's a possibility that you might be my brother, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: No, you can.",
        "Alison: No, please don't. I don't want to do this, ok? I don't. We can't do this, not for sure, not until --",
        "Rafe: We have proof.",
        "Alison: Yes, exactly",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, no, that's what I'm saying. We have proof.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Rafe: Here. It's right there. See, the captain -- he buried some papers of your father's.",
        "Alison: What do you mean? What papers?",
        "Rafe: For insurance, you know, just in case. Now, look at this. These are pages ripped from your father's journals -- His real journals, not the phony ones that Caleb sent you, all right? See?",
        "Alison: These are really -- these are really his handwriting.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. All right, now, this, right here. Right here, right there, he talks about the other child, all right? Now, right here in this legal document, in the same handwriting, it says that the other child is a girl.",
        "Alison: Is a girl.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, you have a sister, Alison, not a brother. It's not me.",
        "Alison: It's not you.",
        "Rafe: No",
        "Alison: We're not --",
        "Rafe: No.",
        "Alison: Oh, God, it's finally over. Oh, it's finally over.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Elizabeth: You never took this whole thing seriously from the very beginning. All you've ever been thinking about is your Olivia.",
        "Caleb: I hope I didn't get you in trouble with your husband.",
        "Tess: Things couldn't be better between Jack and me.",
        "Alison: I guess I'm just going to have to have a sleepover."
