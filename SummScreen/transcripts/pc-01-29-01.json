        "Ian: Not important? Of course it's important. ",
        "Arianna: What are you doing here? ",
        "Ian: Gabriela told me that Ben showed up here with some Immigration officials \r\nto get you deported. Is that right? ",
        "Arianna: I should have never gotten you involved. ",
        "Ian: Tell me what happened. I want to help you. ",

        "Jack: It's pretty nifty. Wow. ",
        "Lucy: Pretty nifty? Pretty nifty? This place is brand-spanking sweet, not \r\njust nifty. ",
        "Jack: Ok, I'm sorry. Brand-spanking sweet. I don't know what I was thinking.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Well, there you go. Now you have good taste. ",
        "Jack: Some of the best, which brings me to that bar. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, isn't it beautiful? You know what? ",
        "Jack: Stocked up on the good stuff? ",
        "Lucy: It's stocked because, you know, when I go change my whole life, I go \r\nwhole hog. So everything you want -- one of, at least -- is in that bar. ",
        "Jack: All right, all right. Let's break this puppy open. Ma'am, can I pour \r\nyou a drink? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. No, no, no. I want the -- oh! -- Whole bottle, please. ",
        "Jack: Whole -- are you sure? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I think we need to, you know, sort of forget those people that \r\nwe're supposed to be forgetting, those stinkers that broke our heart. Don't you \r\nthink? ",
        "Jack: I think. So, right. ",

        "Ben: Well, it's the last time I'll warn you. Keep out of our family business! \r\nNow, you have no right to -- ",
        "Ian: No right? You left your own sister to die at the bottom of a staircase, \r\nand you're talking to me about rights? ",
        "Arianna: Ian, please. ",
        "Ben: You put yourself in my way again and you're going to regret it. ",
        "Arianna: He means that. You don't know how dangerous he is. ",
        "Ian: He doesn't scare me. ",
        "Ben: Well, nor you me. And I will do what I came here to do. ",
        "Ian: I'm going to stop you from hurting Arianna. What's the matter with you? \r\nYour sister was raped. Don't you understand that? ",
        "Ben: Yes, I am aware. ",
        "Ian: Well, then stop making her feel like she's responsible because she is \r\nnot. ",
        "Ben: Arianna has told you her side of things, but there's a lot more to tell.\r\n",
        "Ian: Oh, goody, then why don't you tell me? Why don't you tell me what would \r\njustify a brother killing his own sister? ",

        "Lucy: You know, I'm not so sure that this is such a good idea for me to be \r\nplaying with fire at this point. ",
        "Jack: That could be a bad thing. ",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm. Voila. Oh. Listen, I want you to hear this. This is -- ",

        "Lucy: Oh, wow. This is Doc's favorite. ",
        "Jack: Well, good for Doc. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you know, he loves jazz, and so when we broke up I swore I wasn't \r\ngoing to listen to it anymore, but this is the one he always played for me, over \r\nand -- ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey. Thought the whole point of tonight was to forget about \r\nyour guy and for me to put my -- I'm not going to say her name -- out of my \r\nmind. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that sounds good. But, you know, it's sort of hard sometimes not \r\nto think about him. ",
        "Jack: Hey, we've got to try, all right? We both do. ",
        "Lucy: But you don't think it's -- ",

        "Lucy: Oops -- sort of hard to forget about your girlfriend? ",
        "Jack: Ex-girlfriend. Ex. And, no, it's not that easy, but that's how it has \r\nto be. She's not coming back. I can still see the look in her -- ",
        "Lucy: In her eyes when -- what? What? What? ",
        "Jack: No, I got to forget about it. I got to move forward. I got to put the \r\npast behind me and move forward. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Good. You do, and you can. I know you can because look at you. \r\nYou're just so -- you know, you're very attractive. You are. ",
        "Jack: Well, thanks. You're very attractive, too. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, thanks. You know, I think we should drink to that. Here, let's \r\ndrink to our attractiveness together. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Here, you pour. ",
        "Jack: You know, you're great. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. ",
        "Jack: I mean, you have really great everything. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Oh, well thank you. You know, I think, from what I can see, you \r\nhave pretty great everything, too. So, cheers. Oh, but, you know, this leads me \r\nto a question. ",
        "Jack: And what might that be? ",
        "Lucy: Well, if we're just so darned attractive, how did we get here, like \r\nthis? ",
        "Jack: Karma. ",
        "Lucy: Karma? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then, you know what? Then those two losers that dumped us -- they \r\nmust be related. ",

        "Alison: What's -- ",
        "Livvie: They don't look very happy, do they? ",
        "Alison: No, they don't. Neither do you, and I bet I know why. You have \r\nwhat's-his-name on your mind, don't you? ",
        "Livvie: I can't help it. Jack just makes me so mad. ",
        "Alison: But? ",
        "Livvie: What? I just -- I don't know. I wish I knew where he was, that's all. \r\nAnd what he's doing. ",

        "Karen: Think I should go check on Eve? ",
        "Joe: No, maybe we should give them some time alone. ",
        "Frank: If they're keeping us waiting, it must be something big. I just wonder \r\nwhat it could be. ",
        "Mary: Maybe Eve just isn't up to all this excitement. ",
        "Mac: Something tells me there's more to this pause than nerves. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Eve, just tell me what you need. Do you need to sit down? Do you need \r\nsome water? ",
        "Eve: No, I don't need anything. ",
        "Kevin: Then what is it? ",
        "Eve: I can't. Kevin, we can't. ",
        "Kevin: Can't what? Eve, whatever it is, just tell me. Let me help you. It'll \r\nbe all right. I promise. ",

        "Eve: I can't go through with it. ",
        "Kevin: You want to cancel everything? ",
        "Eve: Yes. You know, Kevin, this hasn't felt right from the very beginning. \r\nAnd we both forced this idea on each other, and now that it's here -- ",
        "Kevin: You don't want it. ",
        "Eve: It's not just me, is it? ",
        "Kevin: I was so sure this is what you wanted. ",
        "Eve: It was. I wanted this so much. God, I don't know what I want. I'm sorry. \r\nI'm so sorry. ",
        "Kevin: Shh, shh. Don't be. You're right. It's not just you. ",
        "Eve: How did this happen? ",
        "Kevin: We tried too hard to get things back to the way they were. But \r\nsomething changed. Things are different between us. ",
        "Eve: It's true. It's not like it was before. ",
        "Kevin: The question is, what do we do now? ",
        "Eve: I can't stay and face everybody, not like this. ",
        "Kevin: Well, we could go somewhere. Eve, we should talk. ",
        "Eve: I know this sounds strange, but I really need to be by myself right now.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Ok. Ok. I'll think of something to say. ",
        "Eve: Are you sure? ",
        "Kevin: Sure is the last thing I am. But I'll take care of it. You go. Go on.\r\n",
        "Eve: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Eve? Nothing. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm sure you've all figured it out, but I'll make it official \r\nfor you. We -- Eve and I -- we're going to postpone the wedding ceremony just \r\nfor today. But we'll let you all know what we decide to do. Thank you for \r\ncoming, everybody. ",
        "Victor: Monk. Are you all right? ",
        "Kevin: No, not really. But I have a feeling I will be. ",
        "Livvie: I told you she wasn't right for my dad. ",
        "Alison: Now, don't go putting this off totally on Eve, ok, until we know the \r\nwhole story yet. All right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I guess. I don't know. ",
        "Alison: Well, the only thing that I am sure of is I'm starving. And I'm sure \r\nthat the reception is off, so, I don't know, why don't we go get some food or \r\nsomething? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Let's go. ",

        "Gabriela: He had to check on that friend of his, Arianna. ",

        "Gabriela: Hey. ",
        "Joe: Hey. Any news? ",
        "Karen: Not a word. I think I'd better go look for her, Frank. ",
        "Frank: Whoa, hang on. You guys are headed back to the house, right? Do you \r\nmind taking Neil and Serena? Then I can go with Karen. ",
        "Joe: No, no -- ",
        "Karen: No, you can't. ",
        "Frank: Why not? ",
        "Karen: Because I have a pretty good idea where Eve went, and if I'm right, \r\nthe last thing she needs right now is an audience. ",

        "Ben: You have no idea what you're getting involved in. ",
        "Ian: Of course I don't, because I'm an idiot. So why don't you try to educate \r\nthis infidel? ",
        "Ben: If honor is not in your vocabulary, doctor, there's nothing I can do or \r\nsay to educate you now. ",
        "Ian: Honor, is it? ",
        "Ben: Yes, family honor. And for that, where I come from, life is worthless \r\nwithout it. No one individual life matters. ",
        "Ian: To me, nothing matters more than an individual life, so there you are.\r\n",
        "Ben: You disgraced the family name. You disgraced all that is holy. ",
        "Ian: I know forgiveness. It's quite a belief system you got going there. ",
        "Ben: Oh, you judge my culture? Look what goes on here. You have young girls \r\nless than 13 having sex. Children having children. A culture where half your \r\nmarriages end in divorce. What, you telling me that here is better? ",
        "Ian: No, I'm not saying it's better. People have problems. We make mistakes, \r\nbut we don't kill them to make ourselves feel better. Now, somewhere out there, \r\nthere's a man who raped your sister. He's the one you should be after. That I \r\nwould understand. How can you look at her? How can you look her in that face and \r\nnot see -- because you don't want to see, do you? It doesn't matter what anyone \r\nsays or does. It's not going to change your mind. You'd much rather have her \r\ndeported, take her back home, and do this honor killing, no matter what. ",
        "Ben: I will do what must be done, no matter what. ",
        "",
        "Kevin's Voice: Excuse me, I'm a doctor. Can I help? Eve, get better. Do it \r\nfor you, do it for me. I don't care. Just do whatever it takes. I'll make it up \r\nto you, I swear. ",
        "Lucy: Every fiber of my being is screaming at me. We belong together. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please, don't do this to yourself. ",
        "Lucy: You're not going to go through with this ceremony because you know it, \r\ntoo. You know we belong together. ",

        "Kevin: Who is it? ",
        "Mac: How you doing? ",
        "Kevin: Been better. ",
        "Victor: Should we ask what happened? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, you know me, Victor. I just can't have a wedding without someone \r\nor something interrupting the ceremony. ",
        "Mac: So, what happened? ",
        "Kevin: The timing just didn't feel right. The stars are out of alignment. I \r\ndon't know. I'm sorry I abandoned the guests. ",
        "Mac: Everyone understood. ",
        "Victor: Why don't I make sure the caterers are taken care of? ",
        "Kevin: Thank you, Victor. Have as many capons as you like. ",
        "Mac: Mutual decision, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Actually, it was. I just didn't realize that I felt the same way until \r\nEve stopped the ceremony. But in the end, we both agreed. ",
        "Mac: Yeah, the stars weren't right. I know, I heard. Only that sounds more \r\nlike Lucy talking than Eve. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy knew that I wouldn't go through with it. ",
        "Mac: She said that to you? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Took a hell of a bite out of her for it, too. ",
        "Mac: Yeah, well, knowing Lucy, there wasn't any other way to get her to let \r\ngo. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Except now all I can see is her face and how hurt she was. ",
        "Mac: Where are you going? ",

Oh, and -- oh, see right here? This closer-shaving foam -- this, \r\nyou would love. It's a nice product. You'd like it. ",
        "Jack: It's incredible. ",
        "Lucy: How would you know? You haven't tried it yet. ",
        "Jack: No, not the shaving cream. You. You're so amazing. You create these \r\nproducts that people love, and you have your own company because of that. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm very smart. I surround myself with extremely talented people.\r\n",
        "Jack: No, no, no, because you set the bar. You give these people something \r\nspecial, and that makes you special because you worry about the little things, \r\nand that's why you're successful. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks. Sometimes some people don't think that all the time. I mean, \r\nsometimes, believe it or not, they kind of take me for granted. Even someone \r\nthat I love. So this is awfully nice. It's nice, maybe because it takes someone \r\nnew to remind you that you are special, kind of make you appreciate things. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, I appreciate all the things about you. I think you're \r\nreally great. Really good. ",

        "Alison: Livvie, with all you have going for you, why would you want to waste \r\nit on a loser like that? ",
