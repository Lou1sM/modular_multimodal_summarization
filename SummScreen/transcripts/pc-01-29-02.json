        "Amy: Look, I'm sorry for missing my shift, ok? But that doesn't give you the \r\nright to grill me like I'm some sort of criminal. Or are you back to thinking \r\nI'm a space alien? ",
        "Ian: I just asked what happened to you. ",
        "Amy: You didn't ask, you demanded. ",
        "Ian: Ok, then let me change my tone of voice. What happened to you? ",
        "Amy: What does it matter? I'm back now. ",
        "Ian: I just want to know what happened, that's all. ",
        "Amy: You know what? I don't have to take this. I only work for you, you're \r\nnot my father. ",
        "Ian: Well, that wouldn't have made much difference anyway, would it? You \r\nhaven't been in touch with them for years. That's according to the man who is \r\nyour father. ",
        "Amy: You spoke to my father? ",
        "Ian: Wanted to make sure you were all right. ",
        "Amy: You had no right! You don't know what you've done. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm happy to see you, too, but -- ",
        "Paige: But what? ",
        "Kevin: I thought you were leaving town. Frankly, I thought we drove you away, \r\nas far from Port Charles as you could get. ",
        "Paige: Just because I missed a sitting? Which, by the way, I'm very sorry I \r\nmissed. I really am anxious to get started. ",
        "Kevin: Great. Paige, I have to ask you something first. How did you get into \r\nthe United States on an expired passport? ",
        "Paige: Have you've been going through my things, as well? ",
        "Kevin: I went into your bag when you disappeared. ",
        "Paige: I didn't disappear. I -- I just had somewhere I needed to be. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. I was concerned. ",
        "Paige: Well, look, I'm sorry that I worried you. And as for that old \r\npassport, I -- I keep it for I.D. My valid one I put away for safekeeping. ",
        "Kevin: I just wish you'd told me if you weren't going to be here. ",
        "Paige: You're right. I should have told you. I'm sorry. ",
        "Kevin: Why didn't you? ",
        "Paige: The truth? I needed a break. ",
        "Kevin: A break? ",
        "Paige: From you and Lucy. Look, it's hard sometimes to -- never mind. You \r\nknow what? I'm stupid for saying it, and I -- ",
        "Kevin: No, no, just tell me. It's hard sometimes to what? ",
        "Paige: It's hard sometimes to see you two so happy together. Oh, my God. That \r\nsounded horrible. It's not -- I'm really happy you're happy. I am. It's just \r\nthat -- ",
        "Kevin: Paige -- Paige, I understand. I do. I don't blame you for feeling \r\nuncomfortable. I mean, after all, we were in love once. We were each other's \r\nfirst love. That's not something you just forget. And I think it's made it hard \r\nfor Lucy, too. ",
        "Paige: Lucy? But I thought she was fine with all this. ",
        "Kevin: She was, she was. She is. She's just very protective of what we \r\nhave together, that's all. Which leads me to another question. ",
        "Paige: Sounds ominous. ",
        "Kevin: I didn't know about this, ok? But Lucy did some digging around in your \r\npast. ",
        "Paige: She what? ",
        "Kevin: I didn't say it was right, but she found out a few things that I think \r\nwe should deal with. ",
        "Paige: Such as? ",
        "Kevin: Such as why you never told me that you were in the accident that \r\nkilled your husband. ",
        "",
        "Ed: Look, kid, I know it's a tough decision, but you got to make up your \r\nmind. Do you want to go back down there, or do you want to stay up here? ",
        "Rafe: It wouldn't be so tough if you hadn't told me about the fifth chair.\r\n",
        "Ed: Well, you actually figured that out yourself. ",
        "Rafe: I -- oh. Yeah. Ok, so this -- this chair is waiting for someone close \r\nto me, right? Or Paige or Casey or Amy, huh? ",
        "Ed: Rafe, you got to decide anyway. You can't be a part of both worlds \r\nanymore. You got to make a choice. ",
        "Rafe: I know, I just -- I just don't want to make things worse. ",
        "Ed: I know you don't. Maybe you need to see some more. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: How, Val? How did this happen? ",
        "",
        "Alison: This doesn't even seem real. Valerie dead? ",
        "Livvie: Ali, it wasn't your fault. You know that. ",
        "Alison: No, I know. I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about Jamal. I \r\nmean, he's been in there a really long time. I think maybe I should go to him, \r\nyou know. ",
        "Jack: Hey, we'll wait out here for you. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Rafe. Rafe? ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Livvie: What are you doing here? ",
        "Rafe: I just made a decision. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, ok. Well, I don't know what that means, but you know what? It \r\ndoesn't matter because you don't belong here, Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: I'm exactly where I belong. ",

        "Amy: I cannot believe that you invaded my privacy like this. What did you \r\ntell him? Did you tell him where I am? ",
        "Ian: No, I didn't, but maybe I should have. Your parents deserve to know that \r\nyou're alive. ",
        "Amy: I'm not going to discuss this with you. You had no right to call him.\r\n",
        "Ian: I told you, I was worried about you when you didn't show up for work.\r\n",
        "Amy: I got a call from my ex-boss. It was an emergency. It couldn't be \r\navoided. ",
        "Ian: All right. Why didn't you pick up a phone and call me? ",
        "Amy: Well, as you know, I lost my cell phone and all the numbers I had \r\nprogrammed into it. ",
        "Ian: Don't give me that. People were waiting for you. You knew that, Amy. ",
        "Amy: What do you want me to tell you, Ian? ",
        "Ian: I want you to tell me the truth. ",
        "Amy: Fine! My ex-boss is also my lover, and we spent the whole afternoon \r\nhaving wild, mind-blowing sex in a sleazy motel off the interstate. You \r\nsatisfied? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Why didn't you tell me you were in that accident? ",
        "Paige: Because I didn't want you to know. ",
        "Kevin: Why not? ",
        "Paige: It's hard to understand. I just couldn't tell you. Especially not you.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I thought we were friends. ",
        "Paige: We are. I was -- I was afraid of what you might think. Because it was \r\nso awful. ",
        "Kevin: Paige, you survived an accident. Your husband didn't. That's nothing \r\nto feel guilty about. ",
        "Paige: It was my fault he died. I was driving the car that he was killed in.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Paige, it was an accident. ",
        "Paige: Part of me knows that. But the other part of me knows that if I hadn't \r\nbeen behind the wheel, he'd still be alive. ",
        "Kevin: No. No, you don't know that. ",
        "Paige: Yes, I do. And I'm reminded of it every time I look in the mirror, \r\nevery time Lucy marvels at how I look. ",
        "Kevin: You mean your face? The way you look is because of the \r\naccident? ",
        "Paige: I hate it, Kevin. I hate what I am. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Look, Rafe, I know you mean well, but your being here only makes \r\nthings worse for them. ",
        "Rafe: I just want to be sure Alison's ok. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I'm her best friend. She's got me, she's got Jack, and she's \r\ngot Jamal, her boyfriend. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, and he's got a lot to deal with right now. ",
        "Livvie: It's just that you complicate things, and neither of them need that \r\nright now. So can you just go, please? ",
        "Rafe: No, I can't, ok? I need to be here for her, too. ",
        "Livvie: Why? ",
        "Rafe: Because -- ",
        "Livvie: So you can comfort her? So you can hold her? Rafe, what is it you \r\nwant with her, really? I mean, what can you give her? Only Jamal and Alison can \r\nbe there for each other, and those two are the only ones close enough to \r\nunderstand what's going on. ",
        "Jack: Is there a problem here? ",
        "Rafe: No, there's not. ",
        "Livvie: Yes, there is. I really don't think Rafe should be here right now.\r\n",
        "Jack: Yeah, I agree with her. I don't think so. Maybe this is a good time for \r\nyou to leave. ",
        "Rafe: You know -- look, I'm not going to start a scene now. Just don't be so \r\nsure you're the only ones who know what Alison really needs, ok? ",

        "",
        "Alison: She looks so at -- at peace. Maybe she's finally found some. ",
        "Jamal: I got to call the Hartmans. Hope was her only family since her aunt \r\ndied. ",
        "Alison: Why don't you let me do it? ",
        "Jamal: No, no, I really should, Ali. ",
        "Alison: No, it's ok, Jamal. Let me do it, ok? I'll -- I'll make all the \r\narrangements and I'll call -- ",
        "Jamal: Damn it, Ali, I said no! That is the last thing that Valerie would \r\nwant is you making her funeral arrangements. ",
        "Alison: Ok -- ",
        "Jack: Hey -- Alison? Livvie's going to get some coffee. Maybe you should go \r\nwith her and get some fresh air. ",

        "[Door closes] ",
        "Jack: What are you doing, man? She loves you. Why are you pushing her away? \r\nJamal, Alison did not do this. Valerie tried to kill her. ",
        "Jamal: I know that, Jack. I know Alison didn't kill Valerie. I did. Look at \r\nher, dude. Look what I did to her. ",
        "Jack: Come with me. ",
        "Jamal: What, Jack? ",
        "Jack: You did not do this. We all know Valerie wasn't well. In the end, she \r\ntotally lost it. ",

        "Amy: Does it? Or would you like to know more? The room number? How many times \r\nthat we -- ",
        "Ian: No, no, no, thanks, that's fine. I'm -- that's fine. ",
        "Amy: Good. Because there was no tawdry affair -- unfortunately. I just wanted \r\nyou to see that you didn't have the right to know everything about me. And as \r\nfor the missing shift, for the 20th time, I'm sorry. What more can I say? ",
        "Ian: Why did you lie to me? Hmm? Why did you lie to me about your parents? I \r\nthought above all we were friends. ",
        "Amy: We are friends, and I didn't lie. They are overbearing. They are \r\ncontrolling. They are the walking definition of \"toxic,\" which is why I can't \r\nhave them in my life -- a fact that I didn't share with you because I didn't \r\nfeel the need to lay all that on you. ",
        "Ian: I see. ",
        "Amy: Tell me something -- are you always this suspicious, or is it just me?\r\n",
        "Ian: I was looking for you at the clinic, you weren't there. What was I \r\nsupposed to think? ",

        "Ian: Ok. Yeah, right. Well, maybe I went a little overboard with that. ",

        "Kevin: I suspected you had skin grafts. That really doesn't make a \r\ndifference. ",
        "Paige: How can you say that? ",
        "Kevin: Because what I see is the same beautiful woman that stole my heart all \r\nthose years ago. ",
        "Paige: I thought if you knew the truth, I would look in your eyes and see \r\nrevulsion -- or worse, pity -- but I don't. Thank you for that. ",

        "Jack: And that's not your fault. You did everything you could. You tried to \r\nhelp Valerie. She did this to herself. ",
        "Jamal: That's bull! Valerie begged me for help when she was locked up, and \r\nwhat did I do? I turned my back and I told her that me and Alison were going on \r\nvacation. So don't try to tell me anything, and don't try to cut me any slack. \r\nOk? Valerie's death is on me, not her. ",
