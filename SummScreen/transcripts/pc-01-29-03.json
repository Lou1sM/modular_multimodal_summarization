        "Alison and Rafe plan for a romantic night together. Caleb's willingness to leave without a fight hurts Elizabeth, who informs her daughter that she's ready to go home. Having no intentions of letting Alison leave yet, Rafe uses some magic to keep his soul mate in town for the night. When an annoyed Elizabeth informs her daughter that the airport is fogged in and no flights can get out, Alison returns to her room to find Rafe preparing for a romantic evening with her. Caleb joins Tess at the overlook, where he tells her that his wife left him. He asks Tess to honor her promise to help him find the good inside him, but Tess refuses. Knowing that he still loves Livvie, she accuses him of talking about his failed marriage as a trick to try to draw Livvie out again. Casey informs her mortal sister that she's fixing her mess. With a snap of her fingers, she sends the two vampire musicians to their beds and returns Reese's photos to her backpack. Marissa is thrilled to learn that her sister gets to stay, but her excitement ends abruptly when Casey informs Marissa that she's taking her place in Port Charles. Marissa has to leave; otherwise, she and Jamal will both be dead. She'll have a good life, but she'll never remember coming to Port Charles. With another snap of her fingers, Casey sends her sister away. As Casey explores the park, she's startled when Jamal sees her from behind and calls out her twin's name."

        "Elizabeth: So what are you saying? You would just walk away like that? Just from me? From us? No regret?",
        "Caleb: You're leaving me. Did you forget saying that, or was it some kind of joke?",
        "Elizabeth: The only joke around here is this pathetic excuse for a marriage.",
        "Caleb: Oh, stop being so dramatic.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no, Stephen, why don't we just be honest for once, ok? You never took this whole thing seriously from the very beginning. And why is that? Because all you've ever been thinking about is your other woman, your Olivia.",
        "Caleb: Elizabeth --",
        "Elizabeth: She is the one that you've wanted all along! I never even meant anything to you!",
        "Caleb: You're wrong. You mean a lot to me. But I've never been one to beg. The jet's yours. Take it whenever you need it. Oh, and, Elizabeth, I will find out what happened to Joshua.",
        "Elizabeth: Ugh! Ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: The nightmare is over, Alison. Hey, we found what we came here for.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. You knew it, didn't you? From the very start, you knew that it was Caleb who set us up to make us look like brother and sister. You never needed proof one time, did you?",
        "Rafe: No, but you did.",
        "Alison: And I love you so much, but --",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Alison: I mean, I have so many of these pictures in my mind, you know? I have my mother and Joshua and her killing him --",
        "Rafe: To save your life.",
        "Alison: I know, I know, but then there was the body, and your disposing of it, and then her and Caleb in bed together, and it's dumb.",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, shh, shh. No, listen to me.",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Rafe: I know you've been through a lot. And there's a lot to go before we figure this all out, but just for now -- just for now, can you forget about all this? Just you know what? I mean, just push the whole rest of the world out and concentrate on us, how much we love each other, how lucky we are to be together, how long it's been since we've just been able to do this. Yeah, just -- be so close. And -- and --",
        "Alison: And be held to make love to each other.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison?",
        "Alison: Oh. It's my mother. Mother? Hey. What's the matter?",
        "Elizabeth: He's gone, left. Just like that. Just couldn't get away from me and back to Port Charles fast enough.",
        "Alison: Isn't that -- isn't that what you wanted?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, yes, but -- he didn't even put up a fight.",
        "Alison: I really believe that it's -- it's best this way, for more reasons than you know.",
        "Elizabeth: I know. Plus this way he's not going to be poking around looking for Joshua.",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Elizabeth: Where -- where is he?",
        "Alison: Yeah --",
        "Elizabeth: Where's the body?",
        "Alison: I took care of him.",
        "Elizabeth: You?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: You are truly an amazing young woman.",
        "Alison: I promise you no one will ever find out what happened to Joshua, ok?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, with this out of the way, I guess there's only one thing left to do.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Elizabeth: Pack our bags. We're going home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marissa: What's going on here?",
        "Casey: I'm just fixing your mess.",
        "Marissa: Where did they go?",
        "Casey: Home, snug in their bed, where they belong. And those pictures you lifted from Reese -- back in her backpack. Yeah, you're welcome.",
        "Marissa: This is a dream. This has to be a dream. This can't -- this -- this isn't happening.",
        "Casey: Yo, I'm the real deal, sis. Your guardian angel.",
        "Marissa: Really? I mean, I -- I always believed in guardian angels. I just didn't really think --",
        "Casey: We existed? Yeah. I'm kind of new at this gig. But since you and I are, like --",
        "Marissa: Sisters.",
        "Casey: Yeah. And since you were about to get your butt fried, they were, like, \"Casey -- fix this!\"",
        "Marissa: I have so much to say to you! I don't even know where to begin. How long are you going to be staying here?",
        "Casey: Oh, man, pretty much forever.",
        "Marissa: That's great!",
        "Casey: Don't get excited. Ok, I'm here to stay, but you're out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: It's so quiet up here. So peaceful. And all those stars -- there must be a million of them. Is someone here?",
        "Caleb: I didn't expect to find you here.",
        "Tess: Thank you for showing me this wonderful place. I just came back to sort of think.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. I don't want to interrupt anything.",
        "Tess: No, please. Sit with me for a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You want to leave right now?",
        "Elizabeth: The sooner, the better.",
        "Alison: Because I was maybe going to at least take a bath before we went or something.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I just want to put this day behind me. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but --",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, when I was telling Stephen that I was leaving him, he --",
        "Alison: You know, I -- I -- it's ok. I know. I'm sure he hurt your feelings really just badly, and --",
        "Elizabeth: No, he made the most beautiful love to me. And I know that I shouldn't have, but I gave in. I couldn't help it. But afterwards, immediately, just treated me like something he scraped off the bottom of his shoe.",
        "Alison: Oh, mom. Mother, I'm so sorry.",
        "Elizabeth: I should never laid eyes on him. First, he turns me into a vampire, and now it's just -- ugh --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: Let's just get out of here. Shall we leave?",
        "Alison: Ok, yeah. Yeah, let's go. Let me get some stuff together.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, I'm going to call -- I'll call the airport.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Elizabeth: He did leave the plane for us. Lord knows he didn't need it. Probably flapped his big old bat wings all the way home.",
        "Alison: I know. Let me get some stuff together, and I'll just meet you downstairs.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok. Pack quickly, ok? I just want to get out of this country.",
        "Alison: Ok, mother. Ok. I love you.",
        "Elizabeth: All right. See you soon.",
        "Alison: Rafe. Did you hear that? I mean, did you -- maybe I should just tell her. Let me just tell her that you and I are back together, ok? Please?",
        "Rafe: You'll risk Caleb romancing the truth out of her.",
        "Alison: I know, I know. You're right.",
        "Rafe: You know --",
        "Alison: Oh.",
        "Rafe: You don't have to go, though, you know? I mean, I know your mother's hurting, but --",
        "Alison: You have no idea how easy it would be for me to stay here right now. But I -- I can't. I need to -- I need to do this. I need to go back with her, because I'm afraid that if I don't she will end up in Caleb's arms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You smell that sweet air? I can never get enough of it. Hey, I hope I didn't get you in trouble with your husband when I brought you up here earlier.",
        "Tess: No, we're -- we're fine. In fact, things couldn't be better between Jack and me.",
        "Caleb: Must be a great feeling.",
        "Tess: Yeah, it is. I'm so lucky and in love.",
        "Caleb: You hold on to that, Tess.",
        "Tess: Yeah, I will. We will.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Tess: So it shows?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, being in love agrees with you.",
        "Tess: Well, you should know.",
        "Caleb: Some people search a lifetime and they never find it.",
        "Tess: Is everything ok?",
        "Caleb: Yeah.",
        "Tess: I don't -- I don't think so. I can see it in your face. You can -- you can tell me, Stephen. What's bothering you?",
        "Caleb: Look, I'm ok. I want to go.",
        "Tess: No, no, no. It's ok, please. Tell me what's the matter.",
        "Caleb: My wife -- she left me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marissa: What do you mean, I'm out of here?",
        "Casey: You have blown it big-time, Marissa! Getting all up in Stephen Clay's business?",
        "Marissa: I'm sorry. What do you mean?",
        "Casey: You have a short-term memory, don't you? Let me refresh.",
        "Marissa: Ok, Reese, let's see if you're hiding anything. Oh, my God. Jamal is right. Stephen is a vampire. They're all vampires.",
        "Reese: What's you got there, scoop?",
        "Caz: Can we see?",
        "Marissa: How did you do that?",
        "Casey: Look, all that matters is you know way too much. Ok, it's time for you to go home.",
        "Marissa: Home?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Thanks to me and these awesome angel skills, you will have a good life, have a good family -- ooh, have a cute little dog maybe, and you won't even remember a thing about ever coming to Port Charles.",
        "Marissa: I have a life here.",
        "Casey: Yeah -- a life that was almost smoked till I showed up. That's why I got to take over your life for you and make sure that I fix everything.",
        "Marissa: No, you cannot do that. I have a job. I have a boyfriend.",
        "Casey: If you stay, you're dead meat. So is Jamal.",
        "Marissa: What are you saying? My only option is -- is to what, disappear?",
        "Casey: Trust me, I know. I know. It blows, but it's the only way. By the way, your song \"hey, sister\" -- it is the bomb! It got a lot of airplay upstairs.",
        "Marissa: Oh. I'm not going to remember anything?",
        "Casey: You're going to have a great life. Trust me. Just not here.",
        "[Marissa sighs]",
        "Casey: I'll always have your back, sis.",
        "Marissa: Yeah, you'd better.",
        "Casey: Ok. Ok? Here we go. Now, click your heels three times -- oh, whatever floats your boat. It's showtime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: You have got to be kidding me. It -- ok -- yes, thank you. Could you call me as soon as it clears? Thank you. Oh, man.",
        "Alison: What's the matter?",
        "Elizabeth: We're totally fogged in. We can't leave tonight. I mean, can you believe that? It was perfectly clear, and just like that, this fog rolls in out of nowhere.",
        "Alison: Yeah, that sounds -- that's really strange.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, it shouldn't surprise me, the way this whole trip has gone. Oh, I'm sorry, Alison.",
        "Alison: No, no, that's -- that's ok. I don't mind hanging out a little bit longer.",
        "Elizabeth: You haven't gotten to do anything. Do you just want to go around the corner to that little trattoria?",
        "Alison: You know what? I'm so tired. I think maybe I'll just go back to my room and go to sleep.",
        "Elizabeth: All right. Thanks for everything, sweetie. And listen, Alison, did you really mean what you said about standing by me, even though you know what I am and what I've done?",
        "Alison: Of course.",
        "Elizabeth: It means more to me than anything in the world. I'm just sorry that you didn't get what you came here for.",
        "Alison: No, that's ok, really. I think that we're all going to be ok.",
        "Elizabeth: I hope so. Well, sleep tight, baby.",
        "Alison: Ok. Ok. Good night.",
        "Elizabeth: Good night.",
        "Rafe: Back so soon?",
        "Alison: Yeah a funny thing just happened.",
        "Rafe: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah. The airport got fogged in.",
        "Rafe: Hmm. No kidding?",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was clear as a bell, and then all of a sudden, just this big fog bank came in.",
        "Rafe: Hmm, it's very unusual.",
        "Alison: Yeah. That's what I was thinking.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. So, what are you going to do?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I mean, there's no planes that can take off, so --",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Alison: Yeah. You know, I mean, the fog and the planes and stuff --",
        "Rafe: Well, yeah, well, maybe the fog will lift, and then you can leave, you guys, you know?",
        "Alison: Well, actually, the thing is, is that due to, you know, fog and -- and planes and stuff, you can't -- we can't take off tonight.",
        "Rafe: Oh. That's a shame.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I guess I'm just going to have to have a sleepover.",
        "Rafe: I was never going to let you leave me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Your wife left you?",
        "Caleb: I guess it was only a matter of time.",
        "Tess: And you loved her?",
        "Caleb: Well, I am not going to bother you with this, ok?",
        "Tess: It's ok.",
        "Caleb: I tried. I really tried. It's -- I just couldn't make it work.",
        "Tess: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Elizabeth -- she tried to reach me time and time again, and I think she's finally just given up. I can't blame her, really. You know, it's funny.",
        "Tess: What?",
        "Caleb: Here I am, and people -- they think I have everything -- money and power and fame. And what does it all mean if at the end of the day you have no one to love? You remember that night, the night you told me that -- that you thought that everyone had good inside themselves? You believe that?",
        "Tess: Yes.",
        "Caleb: You think you could help find it in me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Oh, man. It is weird being back. Nice, but it's weird. The place hasn't changed much. Hey, Bro. Long time no see. Yeah, I am definitely digging this.",
        "Jamal: Marissa?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I've missed you. I've missed this.",
        "Rafe: Oh, me, too.",
        "Alison: I missed your heart beating like that. This feels so normal. This is normal.",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Finally.",
        "Rafe: It's all I ever wanted. I never want to wake up with you not by my side again.",
        "Alison: It got kind of scary there for a little bit, didn't it?",
        "Rafe: Well, you know, I just kept my eyes on the prize.",
        "Alison: I love you, Rafe Kovich.",
        "Rafe: And I am going to spend the rest of my life making you happy.",
        "Alison: Why don't you start now?",
        "Rafe: Ok. I could do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I never asked -- I never asked for help from anyone before, ever.",
        "Tess: I said I would, that night back at my house. I promised you to help find the goodness inside you.",
        "Caleb: So you'll help me?",
        "Tess: I can't.",
        "Caleb: I don't understand.",
        "Tess: This is the first time that we've talked that you have not mentioned Livvie -- your Olivia. Instead, you keep talking to me about your wife leaving you.",
        "Caleb: But she has.",
        "Tess: But that's not why you're here. It's no use. I can see it in your eyes. You still want Olivia. You still think you can draw her out from inside me. But you promised me that night in the hospital, the night I almost died. You said no more tricks. And you lied. You're trying to trick me now. Shame on you, Stephen.",
        "Caleb: I got to hand it to you, Tess. You're something special.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Rafe: I got to start doing what I trained to do my whole life.",
        "Alison: You need to fight?",
        "Rafe: With everything I got.",
        "Caleb: It seems our friend Joshua has disappeared.",
        "Lucy: You're hurting me!",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you belong to me and I belong to you, and nothing and no one is going to get in the way of that!"
