        "Alison: I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know you were on your way over? \r\nWell, you said you weren't coming. No, no, that's -- that's fine. Just -- we'll \r\nwait for you. Just hurry. Ok. God, guys. Could they be any more of a pain? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I think this is my fault. ",
        "Alison: No, it's not, Livvie. It's Jamal. He's been trying to pick a fight \r\nall day. I do not know what his problem is. ",
        "Livvie: Well, we did ask him to join us and now we're just bailing on him.\r\n",
        "Alison: I know, but I told him how upset you were about your breakup, that \r\nyou needed to talk to Lucy. He should understand, you know? ",
        "Livvie: Um -- you know what? I just -- I think I'm going to go over by \r\nmyself. ",
        "Alison: No, I want to go with you -- that is, if you don't mind waiting a few \r\nminutes for Mr. Grumpy to get here. ",
        "Livvie: I think you and Jamal need some time alone. I really am going to do \r\nthis myself. ",
        "Alison: I think you're a little anxious to hear that it's ok for you not to \r\nbe mad at Jack anymore. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Well, you know I'm not going to hear it from you. ",
        "Alison: Duh. ",
        "Livvie: I'm out of here. ",
        "Alison: All right. ",
        "Livvie: Good luck with Jamal, ok? ",
        "Alison: Thanks. And let me know what happens over at Lucy's. ",
        "Livvie: You act like this is some big deal. I'm just going over to talk. \r\nNothing's going to happen. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: What in the hell is going on here? ",
        "Jack: This -- this is Doc? ",
        "Lucy: What -- what do you mean, you know him? ",
        "Kevin: I'm still waiting for an answer over here! What in God's name \r\nis this? ",
        "Jack: Oh, my -- ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know what? Doc, this -- this is none of your business. ",
        "Jack: Dr. Collins, I can explain this whole thing. ",
        "Lucy: No, listen to me. You don't owe him an explanation. You have no right \r\nbarging into my new house. ",
        "Jack: Lucy, Lucy, you don't understand. This is -- ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I do understand perfectly. Doc, I understood you. You told me to \r\nmove on and that's what I am doing. ",
        "Kevin: Are you out of your mind? ",
        "Lucy: Why? Did I misunderstand something? A few hours ago, you killed me. You \r\ntold me to get on with my life. That's what I did. You said you're getting on \r\nwith your little life with Eve. Well, go ahead. Live happily ever after. What is \r\nthis about? Are you being jealous now? ",
        "Kevin: \"Jealous?\" Oh, my God! You have no idea who he is, do you? ",
        "Lucy: I know perfectly well who he is. This is Jack. I met him in jail. ",
        "Kevin: Why doesn't that surprise me? ",
        "Lucy: I am not going to stand here and let you insult my new friend. ",
        "Kevin: Your friend? Your new friend? Let me tell you something about your \r\nfriend, Lucy. That is Livvie's boyfriend. ",
        "Jack: Oh, no. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian. ",
        "Karen: Eve? ",
        "Eve: Karen? ",
        "Karen: Colleen told me you were looking for Ian. What happened? ",
        "Eve: I remembered. ",
        "Karen: You mean you got your memory back, the missing days? ",
        "Eve: My dreams, the dreams about Ian. They weren't just dreams. And the \r\nfantasies weren't just fantasies. ",
        "Karen: Eve, what are you saying? ",
        "Eve: Ian and I fell in love. ",
        "Karen: Eve, are you sure? ",
        "Eve: I am positive. The night that I was hit by the car, I was on my way to \r\ntell Kevin about Ian and me, that we had fallen in love and we wanted to start a \r\nlife together. But Kevin wasn't there -- he didn't answer the door -- so I never \r\ngot the chance. ",
        "Karen: So all this time, Ian knew? ",
        "Eve: Yes. He was trying to find a way to tell me, but I -- I didn't see it. I \r\nthought he was in love with Arianna. ",
        "Karen: So how'd you finally remember? ",
        "Eve: Ian told me something before the ceremony, and I couldn't quite place \r\nwhere I had heard it before, but I knew I had. I -- I didn't realize what it \r\nmeant until right before I was to exchange vows with Kevin. ",
        "Karen: Well, what did he say? ",
        "Eve: He said, \"Not just tonight. For always.\" ",
        "Karen: What? ",
        "Eve: He said right before the ceremony, \"That's what friends are for -- not \r\njust tonight. For always.\" And that's the exact same thing he said to me the \r\nnight that we admitted that we loved each other, and we were about to make love.\r\n",
        "Karen: About? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. I wanted to and he wanted to. But he told me that he didn't just \r\nwant me for one night, but for always. ",
        "Karen: Wow. ",
        "Eve: Yes! Exactly! That's why I have to find him and tell him I remembered \r\nand that I feel the exact same way! ",
        "Karen: Ok, ok. Let's go talk to Colleen. Maybe if she knows where Arianna is, \r\nit'll lead us to Ian. ",
        "Eve: Ok, let's go. ",
        "Eve: Colleen! ",
        "Colleen: Karen, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Hi, Colleen. Listen, Dr. Thornhart's friend, Arianna -- was she \r\ndischarged? ",
        "Colleen: No, not that I know of. In fact, I told you -- Ian was with her \r\nearlier. ",
        "Karen: Well, they're gone now. ",
        "Eve: Do you know where they went? ",
        "Colleen: No, but I'm not surprised that Ms. Shapour's gone. ",
        "Eve: Why? Why do you say that? ",
        "Colleen: Well, INS was here asking a whole bunch of questions about her. The \r\nbuzz was they were looking to deport her. ",
        "Eve: Thanks, Colleen. ",
        "Colleen: Sure. ",
        "Eve: Ian is trying to hide her. ",
        "Karen: You think? ",
        "Eve: Absolutely. It'd be just like Ian. The question is, where has he taken \r\nher? ",
        "",
        "Alison: You've had, like, major attitude all day. Have I done something to \r\nmake you mad or -- ",
        "Jamal: No, no, you haven't done anything. ",
        "Alison: Well, then, what's up with your mood? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm not in a mood, ok? ",
        "Alison: Hey. Is it the work thing? Is that what it is? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, I'm tired of not having a job. Ok, no money is -- ",
        "Alison: You do have a job. ",
        "Jamal: I mean, a real job, Ali. Come on. Ahem. I mean, where I'm not filling \r\nin as some box boy to cover rent. ",
        "Alison: You'll find something. You will. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. Sure. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so that was really fun. Why don't you tell me what's really going \r\non here? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I just did, ok? ",
        "Alison: No, you didn't. I think there's more to it than that. ",
        "Jamal: Well, maybe you don't know me as well as you thought you did, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ahem. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I just need some space right now. That's all. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, don't do this. You promised me that you wouldn't shut me out.\r\n",
        "Jamal: All right. You're right, I did promise. ",
        "Alison: So just -- just talk to me. ",
        "Jamal: Things just get hard around this time, you know. ",
        "Alison: Like what? Like around after the holidays or -- ",
        "Jamal: No, no. I mean, today. ",
        "Alison: Well, what's today? ",
        "Jamal: The anniversary of -- the anniversary of the day my mom died. ",

        "Lucy: Livvie was the girl you were talking about? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm afraid so. ",
        "Lucy: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Jack: It's not like I was trying to hide it from you. I mean, her name never \r\ncame up. ",
        "Lucy: No, you're right. It didn't. ",
        "Jack: Cut me some slack. You never told me Doc's real name. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. This is a nightmare. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, exactly. Look, I'm -- I'm getting out. ",
        "Kevin: Not so fast. I told you not to hurt my daughter, but I guess you don't \r\nlisten very well. Well, you listen to me now. You will never go near my daughter \r\nagain. You got that? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, you don't have to worry about that, Doc, because your \r\ndaughter dumped me. ",
        "Kevin: Chip off the old block. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, and not that I owe you any explanations, but I would never do \r\nanything to hurt Livvie, all right? ",
        "Kevin: Really? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: You don't consider having sex with a woman who Livvie considers to be \r\na second mother as hurtful? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, we never -- we never had sex. ",
        "Kevin: Why not? Because I walked in? ",
        "Lucy: You know what? We were upset, very, very upset. ",
        "Jack: Livvie split up on me, all right? I went to the bar, I had a drink. I \r\nmet a lady who happened to be dumped by some creep -- well, which by the way \r\nhappened to be you. ",
        "Kevin: You punk. You don't know anything about me and Lucy. ",
        "Jack: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I know enough. But what I didn't know is that \r\nLivvie and Lucy knew each other. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, so that makes her fair game? You've been broken up from Livvie, \r\nwhat, a whole day and you're already having sex with someone else? ",
        "Jack: What are you talking about -- how many times -- ",
        "Kevin: And as for you, since when have you been picking up boys in bars? ",
        "Jack: Who in hell are you to judge? Huh? Huh? From what Lucy says, you have a \r\nhard time keeping your -- ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'll show you exactly who I am, you little son of a -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no! Stop it! Stop! Please stop, both of you. Look, this is just -- \r\njust a horrible misunderstanding, ok? The important thing here right now is \r\nLivvie. She's just starting to trust people again. Come on, you guys. We can't \r\ndestroy that, please. So what happened here between you and me has to stay quiet \r\nand secret between just the three of us, ok? No one else -- ",

        "Alison: Jamal, I'm sorry. I had no idea this was the day. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I keep -- I keep thinking it'll get easier with time, but -- ",
        "Alison: But it doesn't? ",
        "Jamal: No. I can't -- I can't get her off my mind. ",
        "Alison: That's why you had that box out. Those were all of her things, wasn't \r\nit? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, what's left of them. You know, she had a couple of \r\npictures and poems and stuff and five million recipes. ",
        "Alison: She loved to cook, didn't she? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. The weird thing is she -- I never saw her, you know, look at a \r\nrecipe in my whole life. You know? She'd always say, \"It's up here. It's up \r\nhere.\" ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe she wrote them down so that you could have them for when \r\nshe wasn't here. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I bet you're right. Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Tell me more about her. ",
        "Jamal: What's there to tell? I mean, well, she was an amazing woman, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Alison: Well, how? ",
        "Jamal: Well, like every time my old man got busted, times got, like, pretty \r\ntough, you know? I mean, she worked, like, two, sometimes three jobs just to \r\nkeep food on the table. And she never complained. I'd lay in bed late at night \r\nand just wait for her to come home and she'd come home from one of her \r\nwaitressing jobs and come kiss me goodnight. And I'd sit up and tell her, \"Mom, \r\nhow do you keep going?\" You know? And she'd lean in real close and she'd whisper \r\nin my ear -- she'd say, \"It's just -- it's just a down payment on your future, \r\nbaby.\" She believed in me so much. ",
        "Alison: I'm sure she did. ",
        "Jamal: I mean, she thought I could do anything I wanted, you know? Just be \r\nanything. She'd say, \"Jamal, you're going to turn the world on its ear.\" I'm \r\nalmost glad she's not here to see how wrong she was. ",

        "Livvie: Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Please do come in. ",

        "Livvie: It's nothing, really. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, is there something wrong? ",
        "Livvie: No, I just -- I just wanted to get Lucy's advice on something. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Great. Advice on what? ",
        "Livvie: Well, see, this guy I was seeing -- Jack -- but it can totally wait. \r\nI should've known you'd be here because of what happened at the ceremony and \r\neverything. ",
        "Lucy: What? What -- what do you mean? What happened at the ceremony? ",
        "Livvie: He didn't tell you? ",
        "Lucy: Tell me what? ",
        "Kevin: We'll talk about it another time. Have you had dinner? Let me take you \r\nto dinner. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no. You stay here with Lucy. You guys need to talk. ",
        "Lucy: Need to talk about what? ",
        "Kevin: Eve and I decided not to renew our wedding vows. ",
        "Lucy: Is that -- is that why you came over here? ",

        "Lucy: No, no. No, you have nothing to be sorry for. Don't worry. ",
        "Kevin: It's just been a very emotional and confusing day for everyone. But I \r\nthink you're right -- Lucy and I do need to talk about a few things. ",
        "Livvie: That's cool. I understand. I'm just going to go meet up with some \r\nfriends anyway. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. I do want to talk to you, though, about this person, Jack, \r\ntomorrow, maybe, ok? ",

        "Eve: What? After I pushed him away so many times? Karen, when I think about \r\nwhat I put him through, after I just -- I just went back to Kevin just like \r\nnothing ever happened. No, this must be killing him. I have to find him. ",
