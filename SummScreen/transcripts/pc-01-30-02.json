        "Casey: I'm here to have a good time, you know, enjoy what's left of my \r\nso-called life. Not worry about who's going to fill that stupid fifth chair, \r\nwho's going to die. No, no. Besides, it can't be anyone who really matters to me \r\nbecause no one really does. Yeah. And it's staying that way. ",
        "Ricky: Great. So I'm confirmed for a one-way ticket. No. Thank you. ",
        "Casey: \"Ricky Barrington.\" Now, since when are you a Barrington, huh? ",
        "",
        "Rafe's Voice: Valerie tried to kill Alison. And now Valerie might die, so is -- is \r\nshe the one? Is she going to fill the fifth chair? ",
        "Ed's Voice: No, Valerie's taking another journey. But this will affect Alison. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: So, if the fifth chair is not for Valerie, then who is it for? ",
        "Alison: Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Hmm. Jamal -- ",
        "Rafe: No, it's -- it's just me. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I thought I was having this terrible nightmare that -- oh, \r\nno. No, it wasn't a nightmare at all. I -- what time is it? Where is Jamal? ",
        "Rafe: It's morning. He hasn't come back yet. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Well, I'm sure that he's still with Jack. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: But he's -- he's going to be home soon. Why did you let me sleep so \r\nlong? ",
        "Rafe: You need the rest, ok? ",
        "Alison: No, I don't. I actually need to get this place put back together \r\nbefore he gets back, you know because I don't really want him to see it like \r\nthis. He can't come back to a place like this. No way. Um -- but that's fine, \r\nyou know. I can totally hurry. And if I hurry, I can just clean, like, every \r\nsquare inch of this place. It really won't take me that long. You know what, \r\nthough? I can't -- get off. I think I'll just make some breakfast because I'm \r\nsure he hasn't eaten yet and, you know -- so I'll just make his favorite, which \r\nis French toast -- you know, the kind with blueberry and the bananas. I don't have \r\nany blueberries! That's ok because I can go to the store and get some, and if I \r\nreally hurry, I can -- ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Fix this. ",
        "Rafe: Alison, stop, all right? Just -- what happened happened. You can't fix \r\nit. You can't expect to put everything back the way it was. ",

        "Paige: Good morning. ",
        "Kevin: Morning. My God, is it morning already? ",
        "Paige: Don't tell me you've been up here all night. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- yes. Just doing background stuff. Obviously I need you for the \r\nreal work. ",
        "Paige: Such dedication. ",
        "Kevin: No, it's called not knowing what to do with myself when Lucy and the \r\ngirls are out of town. ",
        "Paige: Oh. When are they coming back? ",
        "Kevin: Later today, if they can make it through that storm. ",
        "Paige: Yeah. It's really coming down. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, worst storm of the season, they say. ",
        "Paige: So, how's it coming along? ",
        "Kevin: You know, it's coming along all right. In fact, better than all right. \r\nIt feels like all the stuff's coming back, you know, like back in the old days.\r\n",
        "Paige: You know, I've been thinking a lot about the old days recently -- you, \r\nme, the two of us. ",
        "Kevin: It was quite a time. ",
        "Paige: Hmm. There's nothing quite like young love, you know? God, do you \r\nremember all the plans we made and those big dreams we had for the future? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Paige: We -- were just kids -- I mean, practically just kids -- and we kept \r\ntalking about the big house and all of those children we were going to have. ",
        "Livvie: Dad? ",
        "Kevin: Honey, what are you doing here so early? ",
        "Livvie: I just came by because no one could reach you last night. You didn't \r\nanswer your cell phone or your pager. ",
        "Kevin: I was up here painting all night and I didn't have my pager because I \r\nwasn't on call. Honey, what happened? ",
        "Livvie: It's Valerie. ",
        "Kevin: Valerie? What about her? ",
        "Livvie: Dad, she's dead. ",
        "Kevin: She's what? ",
        "Livvie: She flipped out and escaped from her room and then went after Alison \r\nwith a gun -- ",
        "Kevin: Alison? Is she all right? ",
        "Livvie: She's ok, but when Jamal and Jack and I showed up, Jamal tried to get \r\nthe gun out of her hand -- ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God. ",
        "Livvie: And it went off. And she died later on in the hospital. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God. Oh. It must've been awful for you -- for everyone. ",
        "Livvie: But I'm ok. ",
        "Kevin: Are you sure? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: You want to talk about it? ",
        "Livvie: No, Dad. No, not right now. Please. ",
        "Kevin: Honey, I'm sorry. I've got to make some calls. I've got to look into \r\nthis. ",
        "Livvie: No, you go ahead. ",
        "Kevin: Paige, would you excuse me? ",
        "Paige: Of course. I understand. ",
        "Kevin: Honey, why don't you wait here with Paige? ",
        "Livvie: Ok, I'll do that. ",
        "Livvie: So, he's been up here all night painting you? Is that it? ",
        "Paige: Oh, Livvie, if you mean to imply something improper, nothing went on \r\n-- ",
        "Livvie: Oh, no, Paige, I'm not implying anything at all. I trust my dad \r\ncompletely. It's you I don't trust. ",

        "Ricky: Hand it over, Casey, or I'm going to -- ",
        "Casey: Or what, huh? You'll call the cops? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, maybe. God knows that if you are around, they can't be too far.\r\n",
        "Casey: Why don't you go do that. And then, while you're at it, you can \r\nexplain to them why you have Ricky Barrington's credit card, hmm? ",
        "Ricky: Hey, aren't you supposed to be in New York or something, huh? Whatever \r\nhappened to those big plans of yours? Wouldn't have anything to do with me, now, \r\nwould it? ",
        "Casey: Oh, please. I got stuck here working and I'm just staying out of \r\ntrouble -- that's all. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah? Says who? ",
        "Casey: The boss man. I'm practically under house arrest. ",
        "Ricky: Frank? You got to listen to him? ",
        "Casey: No, not Frank -- someone much higher up and way scarier. ",
        "Ricky: Really? ",
        "Casey: Speaking of bosses -- you're planning on scamming her, aren't you? \r\nNice -- rich Mrs. Barrington. ",

        "",
        "Rafe: Listen, what happened would be a terrible thing for anyone to go \r\nthrough. You can't expect to just fix it all in one morning, ok? ",
        "Alison: Don't you think I know that? Don't you think I know that French toast \r\nisn't really going to fix anything? I mean, like, look at this place. How is \r\nthis ever supposed to, like, be normal again? I mean, not more than a few short \r\nhours ago, Valerie was standing right there holding a gun on me, like, \r\nthreatening to kill me, and then Jamal walks in. And, you know, thank God that \r\nhe did because if he didn't, I mean -- but you know what? I sort of wish that \r\nmaybe he didn't because that's when it really got all crazy. God! Look at this! \r\nHer blood is still on the carpet! Oh -- ",
        "Rafe: Alison, come on -- ",
        "Alison: No, don't. And you know what the really sad thing is? Is that I know \r\nhe's going to blame himself for the rest of his life for this even though it's \r\nnot his fault. I know that for sure. And the only thing that I really can do for \r\nhim -- the only thing that I know what to do is maybe make some French toast.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Ok. It's all right. I'm right here. It's going to be ok. ",

        "Paige: Livvie, I'm sorry you don't feel you can trust me. But maybe once you \r\nget to know me better. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, no, I doubt it. Paige, I've pretty much had your number from the \r\nstart. ",
        "Paige: My number? ",
        "Livvie: You suddenly drop back into my father's life after years of no \r\ncontact so he can paint you? Come on, Paige. Who are we kidding? ",
        "Paige: Livvie, your father and I have a friendship. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, such a great friendship that my father hasn't heard from \r\nyou in -- I don't know -- forever? ",
        "Paige: Livvie, we have a very deep connection from years ago. That's all it \r\nis, and that's the truth. ",
        "Livvie: No, the truth is my father is a good, decent man who finally got \r\ntogether with the woman he loves -- truly loves. ",
        "Paige: And I'm very happy for him. ",
        "Livvie: And he deserves the happiness he finally has. And if you think for \r\none moment you're going to come between that, well, I got news for you, Paige -- \r\nthink again because it's not going to happen. ",
        "Paige: Livvie, I think it's very admirable that you're so protective of your \r\nfather's marriage. But if I were a threat, why would Lucy have opened her arms \r\nto me and welcomed me here? ",
        "Livvie: Now, that's a really good question, Paige. Maybe I'm just going to \r\nhave to go and ask her. ",
        "Paige: Why don't you ask your dad? In fact, why don't you ask your dad how he \r\nfeels about all of this? ",
        "Kevin: How I feel about all of what? ",
        "Paige: Nothing. Livvie and I were just having a discussion. ",
        "Livvie: No, Dad. Actually, I was telling Paige exactly what I think of her -- \r\nwhich isn't much. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie. Livvie, what is this? ",
        "Livvie: \"What is this?\" It's about the fact that I have seen too many of my \r\nfriends lose or almost lose the ones they love, and I couldn't stand to see that \r\nhappen to you, Dad. That's why you can't allow her to come between you and Lucy, \r\nDad. We won't let her, right? So you can take your friendship and your deep \r\nconnection and your dreams and your painting and go back wherever it is you came \r\nfrom. ",
        "Kevin: All right, Livvie, that's enough. You're wrong about Paige. And not \r\nonly that -- that's an insult to me and to Lucy. ",
        "Livvie: Dad, I know it's not you. ",
        "Kevin: It's not anyone. There is nothing wrong going on here. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, maybe not yet, but -- ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, I know you're upset about Valerie. So am I. She was my \r\npatient, and I feel like I let her down. But I also know that you and me and \r\nalmost everyone we know has been through enough heartache to last a lifetime.\r\n",
        "Paige: Maybe I -- I should go -- ",
        "Kevin: No, no, Paige, it's fine. Livvie, we can't live our lives waiting for \r\nthe other shoe to drop. We can't keep looking around every corner expecting \r\nsomething bad to jump out at us. ",
        "Livvie: But, Dad, so many bad things have already happened. ",
        "Kevin: I know. And I know that both you and I almost lost the people we love. \r\nBut that didn't happen. ",
        "Livvie: No. And it won't. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, Paige. My daughter's been through a horrible ordeal, and I \r\nknow she doesn't mean what she said. ",
        "Livvie: My Dad's right. Paige, I've been through a really rough night, and I \r\noverreacted, and I'm sorry. ",
        "Paige: It's all right, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: But I got to get going, Dad. ",

        "Livvie: No, I -- ",
        "Kevin: And talk some more. ",

        "Kevin: Well, let me walk you to your car. ",
        "Livvie: No, don't. Really, it's really nasty out here. ",

        "Amanda: My grandson? ",
        "Ricky: Casey, what are you talking about? I told you I work for Mrs. \r\nBarrington. I never said anything about being her grandson. ",
        "Casey: Oh. Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry. I guess it was just, you know, the way he \r\ntalks about you -- how you guys are, you know, really tight and all, practically \r\nlike -- like this! ",
        "Amanda: Well, Ricardo's a lovely young man and quite a potential, too. I \r\nthink we better be going. First stop, I've got to go to the -- the jeweler's and \r\nthen my dressmaker's -- ",
        "Casey: Jeweler's, huh? God, I love jewelry. ",

        "Casey: Wow. I guess you don't get to wear it out that much, huh? ",
        "Amanda: Oh, heavens no. It's practically priceless. That's why I'm donating \r\nit, not wearing it. ",
        "Casey: \"Donating it?\" ",
        "Amanda: Yes, I think it'll fetch quite a nice sum at the auction. It really \r\nis exquisite, isn't it, Ricardo? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, yes, Mrs. B -- exquisite. ",
        "Amanda: I'm going to go powder my nose, and we'll be off directly. ",
        "Casey: [Mocking Amanda] Oh, Ricardo, you've got so much potential. Could it \r\nbe you're trying to swipe my important antique necklace? ",
        "Ricky: What, are you crazy? ",
        "Casey: [Normal voice] And if you are, your pal Casey wants in on the action.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Yeah, you are crazy, and, no, I'm not stealing anything from Mrs. B. \r\nBesides, I thought you were supposed to stay out of trouble. ",
        "Casey: Hey, I just thought you might need a little help, that's all. ",

        "Ricky: All right, Casey. What do you want? ",
