        "Ian discovers that making love with Lucy alleviates his vampire symptoms every time. Kevin lurks outside the cabin and abducts his wife when Ian is out of the room. After some romantic time alone, Rafe and Alison strategize about how to do battle with Caleb. Jamal is puzzled by the behavior of the woman he assumes is his girlfriend. He has no idea that Marissa has left town with no memory of ever being there, and that Casey, her dead identical twin/guardian angel, is taking her place. Caleb is frustrated by his inability to stop thinking about Tess and start concentrating on his music. Casey is happy to be reunited with Ricky, even though he believes she's Marissa. A catfight breaks out when Reese sees the way Casey looks at her little drummer boy. Although Ricky and Jamal pull the women apart, it's a furious Caleb who actually breaks up the fight. Jamal argues with \"Marissa\" about her continued association with the band. Caleb learns that Joshua hasn't checked in with the band since the first day of his trip to Capri. After making a few phone calls, he announces that the manager has disappeared. Being nothing like her sister in abilities or personality, Casey worries about pulling this off. Caleb realizes that Rafe had something to do with Joshua's disappearance."

        "Caleb: Get to work, Garza. You want to talk scheduling, talk to Joshua.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, I would talk to Joshua if I knew where he was.",
        "Caleb: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Ricky: It means that between your disappearing acts and his, you want to know something? This band is running on empty.",
        "Caleb: Joshua's been on business. He's he not been phoning in?",
        "Reese: Well, not since the first day. I thought you already knew about that.",

        "Ian: Well, we heated things up pretty well.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. That's not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is I -- I don't know, I was kind of worried. I thought maybe your vampire symptoms are coming back, but looks like I was wrong.",
        "Ian: No, you weren't.",
        "Lucy: They really were? They were coming back?",
        "Ian: Yeah -- hunger and the sweats -- but I'm fine now.",
        "Lucy: Well, good, because I -- I feel a lot better, too.",
        "Ian: No -- no. I mean, I'm fine now. I feel -- I feel good. I'm --",
        "Lucy: You feel good? What do you mean, \"good\"? Do you mean a pre-vampire-bite kind of good?",
        "Ian: Yeah. Because even when I drink Caleb's water, I -- I still have the symptoms, but I can fight them.",
        "Lucy: Right, and now?",
        "Ian: And now I'm -- I'm -- I'm normal, I'm myself. I feel like myself.",
        "Lucy: Completely?",
        "Ian: Yeah. And come to think of it, I was feeling the same way the last time we were, you know --",
        "Lucy: Was that --",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Really? Oh, I know what you're trying to do. You're just trying to make me feel better, because even I don't believe that having sex with me is some sort of miracle cure for --",
        "Ian: What if it is?",
        "Lucy: What if it is? I mean, what if making love to me keeps you from becoming a vampire?",
        "Ian: You thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Lucy: I think I'm thinking what you're thinking.",
        "Ian: All right. I'm ready. Lucy, where'd you go? I thought we're going for a walk. Lucy?",

        "Kevin: I don't know, maybe something to myself.",
        "Lucy: Ow! Doc, please, let me -- ow, you're hurting me!",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you belong to me and I belong to you, and nothing and no one is going to get in the way of that. Drive.",
        "[Car starts]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ok, so -- so let's think about this. Out of all of the millions of people out there who think that they know and love this Stephen Clay, there's really only a handful of people who know exactly who he is. There's Jack and Tess, right?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Ian and Lucy.",
        "Alison: Uh-huh. Ian and Lucy. Jamal.",
        "Rafe: And we can't forget about your mother.",

        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. We're just going to have to keep our relationship a secret, then.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. It's too dangerous if Caleb finds out the truth.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, we'll just keep it undercover. But, I mean, any way that you look at it, we really do have one hell of a team.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. It's true. We got a team. God help us, we got a team.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I don't care what it costs. You hire whoever or whatever you need. You find Joshua. Do you understand me?",
        "Casey: Hey, Stephen?",
        "Caleb: Not now, Marissa.",
        "Casey: I -- I got those lyrics if you wanted to look at them. I'm done.",
        "Caleb: Hold on a second.",
        "Casey: I -- I didn't really do much because the song you wrote -- it was already good.",
        "Caleb: What is this?",
        "Casey: Huh?",
        "Caleb: You made them worse. I didn't think it was possible -- they're worse. Try it again. Sorry, Jimmy.",
        "Casey: I -- I didn't think they were that bad.",
        "Reese: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Looks like the little birdie lost her gift.",
        "Casey: Drop dead, sucker.",
        "Casey: Sorry. It slipped, ok? But whoever said this was a good plan got it all wrong. Marissa's the one with the skills. I got the personality. Come on, man. Is there any way we can mix the two up a little? Something?",
        "Caleb: Listen up, all of you. Joshua's missing, and no one we know has seen him. But you do not lose focus. It's back to work 24/7, as if your jobs depended on it. Do you understand me? Do you understand me?",
        "Caz: Sure thing, Stephen.",
        "Reese: Yeah, we're not going anywhere, boss.",
        "Caleb: I should have known something was wrong. I should have felt it!",
        "Caleb: This is you, isn't it, slayer? You know what happened to Joshua. So what's next, Rafe? Are you coming for me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Caleb. That's you, isn't it, vampire,... that's right. I'm coming after you. I am always coming after you.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lucy: You can't just keep me a prisoner like this!",
        "Kevin: You're not my prisoner, you're my wife.",
        "Elizabeth: When I was sinking my fangs into that neck, I was loving every minute of it.",
        "Caleb: You killed Joshua, and you have no idea what a tactical error that was."
