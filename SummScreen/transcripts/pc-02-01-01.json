        "Alison: Thanks so much for the tip! Do I look like a piggy bank? What is \r\nthis? Come on. ",
        "Jamal: I got it. ",
        "[Alison sighs] ",
        "Jamal: Heads. ",
        "Alison: Ooh, well, it's your lucky day. ",
        "Jamal: Not yet. Now it is. ",
        "Alison: I missed you this morning. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you looked so cute tiptoeing out of bed. ",
        "Alison: You were up? I was trying so hard not to wake you. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, you know, I'm a good actor, so -- ",
        "Alison: Oh, you are just such a regular Brad Pitt. Oh, yeah. So why were you \r\npretending to be asleep? ",
        "Jamal: So you'd move your booty on out to work so I could have a little time \r\nto wrap this for you. ",
        "[Alison gasps] ",
        "Alison: My God! What did you do? This is so big! ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, don't go getting all excited. What's inside is not really \r\nthat big. ",
        "Alison: Well, I will be the judge of that. ",
        "Alison: \"Recipes?\" This is your mother's recipes. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, she would've wanted you to have them. ",
        "Alison: Oh, Jamal, this is no small gift. ",
        "Jamal: I hope it makes up for yesterday, you know? ",
        "Alison: Oh, no, there's nothing to make up for. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, Ali. I was being a big, fat jerk. ",
        "Alison: Oh, Jamal, no. You have the right to be whatever you want to be on \r\nthe anniversary of your mother's death. You can be sad, you can be mad, quiet, \r\nwhatever you want to be. Just know that I will be there with you when you are. \r\nOk? ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: Thank God. Your friend is here. ",
        "Ian: Put your coat on. He'll want to get on the road right away. ",
        "Arianna: And what happens once we get there? ",
        "Ian: Well, we answer some questions and sign some papers. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Arianna: And then it'll be done? I'll be safe? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. You won't have to worry about anyone, including your brother. ",
        "Ben: What's taking so long? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. ",
        "Ben: Arianna! Arianna, open the door! ",
        "Arianna: God, it's Ben! ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Ben: Arianna, do as I say! ",
        "Eve: What are you doing? Look, if she's as mixed up as you say she is, maybe \r\nit's better if you don't scare her. ",
        "Ben: Get out of my way, please. Damn it, she was here. ",
        "Eve: It's ok, it's ok. They couldn't have gotten too far. ",
        "Ben: Well, you know, you'd better be right. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Ok, let's see what we have here -- \"Cajun red beans and rice.\" \r\nMm-hmm. \"Chicken and dumplings,\" \"Callie's Killer Cornbread.\" Your mom's name \r\nwas Callie? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, same as her grandma. ",
        "Alison: Aw. Are you ok? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, it's just -- it's kind of weird seeing her handwriting, you \r\nknow? Kind of makes it seem like she's right here. ",
        "Alison: She is -- in these recipes and in you. ",
        "Jamal: She would've liked you. ",
        "Alison: Do you think? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Because, you know, sometimes I can be a little -- ",
        "Jamal: Loud, pushy, hard-assed -- yeah, I know, you know. ",
        "Alison: \"Hard-assed?\" Whoa. You think I'm hard-assed? ",
        "Jamal: Well -- ",
        "Alison: Do you? ",
        "Jamal: Just like my mom. ",
        "[Alison laughs] ",
        "Jamal: That was her best quality, though. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'm sorry I never got a chance to meet her. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, me, too. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Alison: Oh. Oh, will you get that? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Recovery Room. What's up? ",
        "Karen: Jamal. Great. Just the guy I'm looking for. ",
        "Jamal: Who's this? ",
        "Karen: Your fairy godmother. ",
        "Jamal: Who's this, Karen? ",
        "Karen: Look, I know where there's an opening for a job. Interested? ",
        "Jamal: What, a job? Sure. Come on, now. ",
        "Alison: Is this about work? ",
        "Jamal: Shh. Stop it. ",
        "Karen: Well, how does motorcycle stuntman grab you? ",
        "Jamal: Motorcycle stuntman. Yeah, right. Come on, now, what's the real gig? \r\nStop it. ",
        "Karen: No, listen, there's a movie company filming in GH, some kind of \r\nmedical murder mystery. Anyway, one of the stunt guys broke his leg, and they \r\nneed someone to fill in. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, Karen. They would never hire me. ",
        "Karen: I gave them your name and told them you were a regular Evel Knievel.\r\n",
        "Jamal: You're serious, aren't you? ",
        "Karen: Well, you have an audition with the casting director in 20 minutes -- \r\nthat is, if you can make it. ",
        "Jamal: Can I make it. Karen, I love you. I love you, baby! ",
        "Karen: Ok, don't tell Alison. I'll see you soon. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, thanks. Bye. ",
        "Alison: Ah! So, when do we leave for Hollywood? Ah! ",
        "Frank: All right. You going to Hollywood? ",
        "Jamal: No, I just got a chance to be in a movie, that's all -- you know, just \r\ndoing motorcycle stunts. It's no big deal. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. No big deal, that's all! Jamal, picture it -- \r\nlook, you're up on the big screen, right? All the girls in the audience are \r\ndying to know, \"Who's that hottie?\" Next thing you know, you're making 20 \r\nmillion a picture, starring with Jennifer Lopez. ",
        "Jamal and Frank: Ooh. ",
        "Alison: Make that Angela Lansbury. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I won't be starring with lLassie if I don't get a move on, ok? \r\nSo -- ",
        "Alison: Ok. You're not going to go in that, are you? ",
        "Frank: What's wrong with what he's wearing? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, what's wrong with what I'm wearing? Come on, now. ",
        "Alison: Hello, he looks like a total grunge. ",
        "Jamal: Alison, I'm going to be falling off bikes. Come on, now. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe, ok, but Tom Cruise never fell off in that. I know what \r\nI'm talking about. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, Spielberg. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Whatever you say. ",
        "Alison: Hey. Ah! My God, this is so not to be believed. Jamal, a movie star? \r\nOh! I'm going to have to remind him to thank Karen when he gets his first Oscar.\r\n",
        "Frank: Karen? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, she called and gave Jamal the tip. ",
        "Frank: She didn't happen to ask for me, did she? ",
        "Alison: Not that I know of. Do you think she's going to want, like, 10%? You \r\nknow, like an agent? ",
        "Frank: You know, Jamal doesn't even have the job yet. ",
        "Alison: No, no, not yet, Frank, but he's bound to get it. He's so alive on \r\nthat bike, it's contagious. ",
        "Frank: Well, you know Hollywood, though. You have to pay your dues. ",
        "Alison: Jamal has paid his dues, Frank. I mean, ever since his dad walked out \r\non him and his family. You know, it's time for him to get something back. I \r\nmean, something that he really loves, not some nine-to-fiver, ok? Something that \r\nhe just really, really loves. ",
        "Frank: I think he's already landed the top prize. ",
        "Jamal: Ladies and gentlemen, the new Hell's Angel of the big screen, Jamal \r\nWoods! ",
        "Frank: Whoo! ",
        "Alison: Oh, you look so good! ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know, I know. ",
        "Alison: Hello. Now, just go in there, be your adorable, sexy self, and \r\nthere's no way that they can resist you. ",
        "Jamal: Maybe today really is my lucky day. Know what I'm saying? ",
        "Alison: Ok. Bye. ",

        "Ian's Voice: So what's this? Couldn't walk away from me? Why is that? ",
        "Eve: Because we've gotten so close. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, like we were the only two people that mattered. ",
        "Eve: And if I told you that I felt the exact same way, that no one in this \r\nworld matters to me more than you? ",
        "Ian: If it were true -- if it were true, then -- ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: I would tell you what I've wanted to tell you for so long. ",
        "Eve: Ian, I have to tell you -- ",
        "Ian: Shh. Be careful what you say to a man who's fallen in love with you. ",
        "Eve: God, you don't think I feel the same way about you? You don't think that \r\nI love you? Oh -- oh, God. ",
        "Ian: Oh, don't let this be a dream. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- oh, God. It's -- it's -- it's not a dream. Finally, it's not just \r\na dream. ",

        "Ben: You! ",

        "Ben: You were supposed to come in here and talk to them, put Arianna at ease \r\nso that I could -- ",
        "Eve: So that you could what? Huh? That story that you told me about your \r\nsister needing psychiatric help -- that was a lie, wasn't it? ",
        "Ben: You know, you're wasting my time. ",
        "Eve: How do I know she's even your sister? Tell me that. Hey, hey, hey, hey! \r\nListen, answer me. I'm talking to you. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, it's me. Yeah, I found her, but she got away. ",
        "Eve: Look, if you don't answer me soon, I will have the police -- ",
        "Ben: Would you shut your mouth! No woman talks to me that way! Do you \r\nunderstand me? Huh? ",
        "Ben: They're headed north from Lake Raines on Copperhead Trail Road. I don't \r\nknow, he must be trying to get her asylum in Canada. I don't care. You do \r\nwhatever you have to do. You just find them. Do you understand me? Just find --\r\n",

        "Alison: \"Two cups of buttermilk, one and a half cup of cornmeal,\" and the \r\nlast ingredient is not there. Why would Mrs. Woods leave it blank? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, hi, I -- no, no, I'm holding for Dr. Wexler. I realize she is \r\nbusy -- did you try the fourth floor? I know you're busy. Just tell her Frank \r\ncalled again. All right, what's going on? ",
        "Alison: That is what I would like to know. This is so frustrating. ",
        "Frank: Well, tell me about it. How busy can one woman be? ",
        "Alison: No, I don't think it's about being busy. I just -- I think it's a \r\ntest. ",
        "Frank: Test? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, sure. I mean, think about it. You're going along, you're about \r\nto get things cooking, right? ",

        "Alison: And then suddenly she just deserts you. ",
        "Frank: Well, it feels like that, anyway. ",

        "Frank: Well, so what do you do? ",
        "Alison: If you can answer that, then you've passed the test. I mean, it's the \r\nonly way for you to have your cake and eat it, too. Or in this case, cornbread.\r\n",

        "Mark: I like your attitude. I like your look, too. A little upscale, but we \r\ncan always grunge you up. So, tell me a little bit about yourself. How long you \r\nbeen riding bikes? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, man, I've been riding bikes since I was 10. I mean, motocross, \r\noff-road since I was 13, man. Ever since I've just been killing it, you know? \r\nJust -- ",
