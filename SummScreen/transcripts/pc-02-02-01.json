        "Karen: Well, I had a consult early this morning, and then surgery, and -- ",
        "Kevin: The hospital told me I'd probably find you here on break. I need a \r\nfavor from you. ",

        "Eve: The hospital. ",

        "Lucy: Jack told you everything about what happened last night? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, all of it. ",
        "Lucy: Um -- look, Livvie, I can explain. ",
        "Livvie: How? ",
        "Lucy: If you just -- if you give me a chance, I can. I think I can. ",
        "Livvie: You can explain to me why Jack was using me to get back at his \r\nbrother and lied about it? ",
        "Lucy: Is that -- is that what he told you? ",
        "Livvie: What did you think I was talking about? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I don't know. I just -- I -- I knew that Jack lied about \r\nsomething. ",
        "Livvie: You should have heard the things he said to me last night. ",
        "Lucy: What exactly did he say? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, that I never meant anything to him. Even after everything we've \r\nbeen through, it was all some kind of stupid revenge against Chris. Lucy, how \r\ncould I have been so wrong about him? We spent so much time together. He was so \r\nwonderful. I heard him talking about me to Kevin the other day. He didn't even \r\nknow I was there. He cared about me. I know he did. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, I don't know. Maybe this is for the best. ",
        "Livvie: What is? ",
        "Lucy: Well, Jack, you know, showing his hand. ",
        "Livvie: The more I think about what he's done, the more it just doesn't make \r\nany sense. ",
        "Lucy: Why -- why would you think that? ",
        "Livvie: Well, when I confronted him about using me, he said that he could \r\nexplain and there was more to it, and I didn't want to listen to it, so I just \r\nran off. And then later he said that everything was exactly the way it looked, \r\nand he was just being a jerk, and I should leave him alone. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, so? ",
        "Livvie: So, I think something happened. Something made him do a 180 the way \r\nhe did. Maybe Chris finally got to him. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, I hate to say this, but maybe nothing happened. ",
        "Livvie: Well, he was here. You met him. What do you think? Do you have any \r\nidea why Jack would push me away like this? ",

        "Bartender: Hey, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Hey, what's up, man? Is Jamal around? ",
        "Bartender: I think he went out. ",
        "Jack: Oh. ",
        "Bartender: You want to leave a message? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Just tell him that I'm not going to be around anymore. I'm \r\nleaving town. ",
        "Chris: Whoa. You're in a hurry. What, did you knock off the joint? ",
        "Jack: One good thing about leaving town is I don't have to see your face \r\nagain. ",
        "Chris: Oh. So you're leaving town? ",
        "Jack: I hate to make you happy. ",
        "Chris: There's really nothing here for you. I tired to tell you that all \r\nalong. ",
        "Jack: You know that's not true. ",

        "Jack: I'm not gone yet, and I'm definitely not through with you. ",

        "Karen: Well, she should respond to that. If not, up it another five \r\nmilligrams. Ok, bye. Sorry about that. ",
        "Kevin: Karen, you're Eve's best friend. Now, where is she? ",
        "Karen: She doesn't tell me everything. ",
        "Kevin: You were with her right after we decided to postpone renewing our \r\nwedding vows, but she didn't say anything about where she was going. ",
        "Karen: Look, I don't know exactly where Eve is. I had called her myself and \r\nleft a message. ",
        "Kevin: But you have an idea, don't you? ",
        "Karen: You and Eve are both my friends. ",
        "Kevin: And I'm sorry to put you in the middle. I just want to make sure she's \r\nall right. ",

        "Kevin: Well, I have my answer. ",
        "Karen: What do you mean? ",

        "Ben: I should have known better than to involve you in my family's \r\nbusiness! ",
        "Eve: Look, I want to find Ian and Arianna just as much as you do. So maybe we \r\ncan work together on this. ",
        "Ben: Are you trying to patronize me? ",
        "Eve: No, no. I wouldn't do that. I'm just saying maybe we can help each \r\nother. ",
        "Ben: Oh, you help me? There is nothing someone like you can do for me. How \r\ncould you even suggest that? ",
        "Eve: Just give me a chance. ",

        "Eve: Ok. Then why don't you leave. ",
        "Ben: Don't you tell me what to do! You know what? If we were in my \r\ncountry, a woman like you would have been disciplined long ago! I could kill you \r\nright now and be well within my rights. ",
        "Eve: Well, thank God we're not in your country. What kind of a man does this \r\nto a woman and treats her this way? What kind of a man does this to his family?\r\n",
        "Ben: Don't you talk to me that way. ",
        "Eve: Oh, ok. Oh, you're all big tough guy now because you're picking on \r\nsomebody who's smaller than you. What, do you get a kick out of kicking around \r\nlittle kids, too? ",
        "Ben: You know what? I've heard enough out of you. ",

        "Kevin: I hope you're right. ",
        "Karen: No matter what's happened, you mean a lot to Eve. ",
        "Kevin: Spare me the pep talk, ok? Eve and I have a lot of issues between us, \r\nbut I think she owed it to me to deal with them before she took off with Ian.\r\n",
        "Karen: Are you going to keep looking for her? ",
        "Kevin: I don't think so. ",
        "Karen: Kevin, I just don't want to see you hurt. ",

        "Chris: You'd better watch that temper, Jack. You don't want me to call the \r\npolice. ",
        "Jack: No, I wouldn't give you the satisfaction. And there's one thing I want \r\nto tell you -- me leaving town has nothing to do with you. ",
        "Chris: Well, if that's the spin you want to put on it, fine. But let's be \r\nhonest. I beat you. ",
        "Jack: No, I beat myself. ",
        "Chris: Same thing. The point is I won. ",
        "Jack: You'll never get Livvie, Chris. ",
        "Chris: We'll see. ",
        "Jack: You can tell people what to do, but you can't make people love you. ",
        "Chris: Oh, and you think that Livvie loved you? ",
        "Jack: She still does. And she always will. So why don't you sit on that, big \r\nbro. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Ok, here you go. You know, my special herbal mix -- it always takes \r\ncare of whatever ails you, huh? Here. Voila. ",
        "Livvie: Thank you. But, you know, you still haven't answered my question. Do \r\nyou have any idea why Jack would push me away like this? ",
        "Lucy: Um -- know what? I wish I had some magical thing to say, you know, that \r\nwould take all your hurt away, but I don't. I guess sometimes people we love and \r\nthat we think love us hurt us, you know? And you never really find out why, and \r\nyou just have to accept it. I'm -- I'm so very sorry. ",
        "Livvie: No, it's not your fault. I just wasn't expecting that kind of answer \r\nfrom you. I was expecting more of the, you know, stand-by-your-man kind of \r\nspeech, \"fight for what you think is right\" type of Lucy speech. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, I -- and normally, you know, I'd give you that. That's what \r\nI believe in. I still stand by my beliefs. It's just that lately a lot's \r\nhappened, you know, and I think I'm coming to this awful realization that when \r\nyou love somebody with everything you have and -- and they even love you back, \r\nit sometimes just doesn't work out. ",
        "Livvie: Whatever happened with you and Kevin, anyway? I mean, since he and \r\nEve didn't renew their vows and everything. ",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah, they didn't, but they are still married, so end of story.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe not. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, maybe so. And I think I'm also realizing that what I want \r\nmay not come true now or ever. ",
        "Livvie: God, I feel so bad for you. ",
        "Lucy: No, no. Don't say that. I am fine, really. I am better than fine. I'm \r\nfine. ",
        "Livvie: Really? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, really. I -- oh! In fact, guess what. I am going away for a few \r\ndays. ",
        "Livvie: Where are you going? ",
        "Lucy: A spa. A beautiful, wonderful, luxurious spa. I'm going to be \r\nmud-bathed to an inch of my life. ",

        "Lucy: Yes. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, I don't -- ",
        "Lucy: Come on, it would be so much fun. And I could use the company, and \r\nbesides, it'd really give me a chance to make it up to you. ",
        "Livvie: Make what up to me? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, um -- you know, just everything that's happened to you. ",
        "Livvie: You have already been such a good friend to me as it is. ",
        "Lucy: Then, please, why don't you just come with me. Come on. ",
        "Livvie: You know, I would love to, but I think being alone is something I \r\nneed most right now, so -- ",
        "Lucy: Are you really, really sure? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but thanks anyway. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Oh, oh, guess what? I had a key made up for you because I would \r\nlove it if you stay here -- I mean, just, you know, in case you still want to \r\nlive with me and everything, I thought it'd be great. So there you go. ",
