        "Amy: Well, I'd love to chat, but now's not a good time. ",
        "Chris: No, it won't take long. It's about what I was talking to you earlier. \r\nIt's the -- figured out where I'd seen you before. It was in Philadelphia. ",

        "Chris: Well, I -- I'm holding a photograph. I know you can't see it. It was \r\ntaken in a bar in Philadelphia. I'm in it, and so are you. Why would you lie to \r\nme about this? ",

        "Eve: And you just threw away any chance we had of trying something else. ",

        "Eve: That's not everything. ",

He was lying down, being covered with snow, and a live electrical \r\nwire was lying right beside him. And he must've been shocked. And, oh, my God, \r\nhe could've been lying out there for hours, freezing to death. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no. Wait a minute. He told Paige that he was walking me to my \r\ncar. How could he have been out there for so long without her even noticing? ",
