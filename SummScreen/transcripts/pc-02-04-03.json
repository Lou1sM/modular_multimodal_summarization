        "Lucy kissed Ian to make him normal again. Police arrived to see what the commotion was about. Kevin tried to cover but Lucy told them that Kevin kidnapped her, so they took him away. She told Ian that she couldn't have sent her Doc to jail but that was not her Doc, and she is glad to have Ian in her life. Chris told Jack that Tess has DNA now. Jack figured out that Livvie and Tess are one and the same. Tess was afraid he wouldn't love her any more, but he assured her that he always would. He knows now that Caleb was trying to get Olivia to come out and take over. Elizabeth told Stephen that she needs him but he told her that it's definitely over. She asked about Olivia so he told her. She begged him to kill her or turn her back to being human, but he said he won't kill her and he can't turn her back. He said he will always take care of her and she asked if she could take care of him. Later, Elizabeth heard a noise behind her and turned to find Joshua there. Caleb thought about the times when Livvie offered herself to him and vowed to get her back."

        "Chris: Yeah. I triple-checked the results myself.",
        "Jack: But how?",
        "Chris: I don't really know. And you shouldn't care. I mean, now she can live her life without you having to worry about anyone bothering her, right?",
        "Jack:: Yeah.",
        "Chris: Hey, come on. You should be happy about this. It's what you've always wanted, right?",

        "Chris: Yeah, well, everything in this town is strange, but she -- she's special, and you've always known that. Now she's special and she's real.",
        "Jack: It's just that, first of all, she doesn't have DNA and now she does have DNA and --",
        "Chris: Hey, stop asking so many questions. Just be happy, ok? What's wrong?",
        "Jack: Chris, she just played Livvie's favorite song on that jukebox.",
        "Chris: So?",
        "Jack: And now, she has DNA?",
        "Chris: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not going to let you do this to yourself. I mean, I know Livvie did a number on you, but Tess will never be anything like her.",
        "Jack: No. That's not what I mean.",
        "Chris: Well, good. Ok? Because Livvie was a walking nightmare. Tess is a gift. Ok? Remember that. I got to run, so you take care, ok? ![3E4046D7.JPG](pc- trans-02-04-03_files/image004.jpg)",

        "Jack's voice: No, Tess, you might look like Livvie, but you're not Livvie. It does not mean you're Livvie.",
        "Tess' voice: No, I am her!",
        "Jack: Hey, hey. What do you say we head home?",
        "Tess: I don't want to stop dancing.",

        "Elizabeth: No, not when you look at me like that, not when you kiss me or when you touch me. I just want to be with you! I just can't help it. I want to be with you, Stephen, now. Always. ![3E404714.JPG](pc- trans-02-04-03_files/image006.jpg)",

        "Elizabeth: Yes, we can! Please! Please, Stephen. Please. I just need you so much.",

        "Tess: About?",
        "Jack: Come here. Sit down. Tess, we need to -- we need to talk about Livvie. You remember a while ago, when you told me that you guys were connected?",
        "Tess: Yeah, we're connected like sisters.",
        "Jack: But more than sisters. See Chris showed me the test results.",

        "Caleb: No.",
        "Elizabeth: It's her, isn't it? Olivia? I should've known the very first time I heard you say her name. I have given up everything for you but you can't seem to get her out of your blood, can you?",

Look, I know -- I know that you're -- you're connected. I know that you're more than sisters. Look at me. Hey. You remember when you cut your finger and Livvie bled, too?

        "Tess: No, jack, you won't want me.",
        "Jack: No, no. Why do you say that? I love you. When you came back from the docks, you pointed to right here and said that Livvie was inside, and I just thought that maybe you meant that her spirit was in there or something. But that's not what you meant, is it? And now that -- now that she's gone, you have DNA She's inside you, isn't she, Tess? You mean she's literally inside you. You're one and the same?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Olivia and I were bound to each other through the centuries, before we ever even met, each searching for the other with the same needs and desires, gaping holes that can only be filled by the other.",
        "Elizabeth: But if you loved her so much, why did you marry me?",

It would probably kill me or tear me apart or something, but that man, that -- that wasn't my Doc. I -- I have no idea what he was going to do to me. If you hadn't gotten here, then I'm not sure what would've happened.",

        "Jack: You were two different people, separate, and now you're one. I mean, how?",
        "Tess: When we fell into the river, I tried to reach out to Livvie to save her. We -- we were drowning. Alone, I know we can't survive. Together. We had to be together. We were holding each other, spinning around, faster and faster. And then we became one again.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on one second. How did you -- Tess, how did you become one again?",
        "Tess: Stephen -- he -- he created me from Livvie.",
