        "Jack: Damn! Well, it looks like we're stuck here. Look, do you have a credit \r\ncard or something? ",
        "Livvie: Will I get it back? ",
        "Jack: Oh, that's funny. That's really funny. ",
        "Livvie: I'm just going to scream! ",
        "Jack: You're not going to scream, all right? You'll attract too much \r\nattention. ",
        "Livvie: Well, isn't that the point? ",
        "Jack: No, we're stowaways, remember? ",
        "Livvie: Look, you may have to hide like the criminal you are, but I don't! I \r\ngot stuck in here by mistake, remember? ",
        "Jack: The sooner you're out, the better. ",
        "Livvie: Do you hate me that much, or are you afraid to be alone with me? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Well -- what are you doing in my compartment? ",
        "Kevin: What are you doing in my lap? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! I -- I -- I tripped. Wait, don't you dare try and change the \r\nsubject. What are you doing on my train? ",
        "Kevin: I could ask you the same thing! ",
        "Lucy: Well, not that it's any of your business, but I happen to be going to a \r\nspa to have the stress that you caused me relieved. I'm going to have myself \r\nbuffed and pounded and massaged and all that good stuff -- have my body cleansed \r\nof you. Hmph. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm taking a few days off to go skiing. ",
        "Lucy: Well, goody for you. Leave. Because there are no rolling hills in this compartment. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that. ",
        "Lucy: There's no way I plan to share my private compartment with you, so \r\nleave. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, don't flatter yourself. As a matter of fact, I'm going to find the \r\nconductor and have him seat me as far away from you as possible. Ta! ",
        "Lucy: Ooh! Good! And wait a minute! Don't you dare come back! ",
        "",
        "Eve: You're married? Is it true? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. It's true. We're married. ",
        "Eve: Husband and wife. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: Well, that's the last thing I expected to hear. ",
        "Ian: So now I got to ask you a question. Why'd you come looking for me? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: You are such a jerk. Why do you have to be so hateful to me? God, \r\nwhat an idiot I was to believe in you. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, what you did, it was my fault, all right? And don't you ever \r\nthink you're dumb. You're anything but. ",
        "Livvie: So -- ",
        "Jack: You're free. ",
        "Livvie: No. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what I want to know. Was \r\nanything that happened between us real? ",
        "",
        "[Kevin sighs] ",
        "Kevin: So as you can see, these arrangements simply have to be changed. This \r\nis unacceptable. ",
        "Lucy: Excuse me, but you are trampling all over my good vibrations. ",
        "Conductor: Sorry, lady. ",
        "Lucy: Not you -- him. Serenity killer. ",
        "Conductor: Sorry, folks. I thought the name on the ticket said Lucoe, not \r\nLucy Coe. Didn't realize the occupant was a woman. But since you two seem to \r\nknow each other, is this really a big problem? ",
        "Kevin and Lucy: Yes! ",
        "Conductor: The train's full. ",
        "Lucy: Well, can't you find this -- this man one single little seat out there?\r\n",
        "Conductor: Sorry. ",
        "Kevin: We'll make do. ",
        "Conductor: Thanks, folks. ",
        "Kevin: But if anything opens up, as soon as it opens up -- ",
        "Conductor: I'll move you, Dr. Collins. That's a promise. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Well, since it appears we are trapped like rats in this small little \r\nspace, the best thing I can suggest is we simply ignore each other. ",
        "Kevin: Works for me. ",
        "Lucy: Is there a problem? ",
        "Kevin: Do you have to light that? It smells. ",
        "Lucy: It smells good, and, yes, I have to because it's lavender and it means \r\ntranquility, which I very much need at this point. And wait a minute, I thought \r\nwe agreed not to speak to each other, so you couldn't possibly be speaking to \r\nme. ",
        "Kevin: Ah. That's better. ",
        "Lucy: This is not going to work. This will never work, not in a million \r\nyears! ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's no picnic for me, either. All I wanted to do was go away by \r\nmyself for a few days and instead I'm stuck here with you. ",
        "Lucy: By yourse-- why are you by yourself? Why aren't you carrying a matching set \r\nof little luggage? Where in the world is your lovely little wifey? ",
        "",
        "Eve: I came looking for you for a lot of reasons. Kind of hard to explain now \r\nunder the circumstances. ",
        "Ian: Why don't you try? ",
        "Arianna: Ben's waking up. ",
        "Ben: What the -- get these ropes off of me! ",
        "Ian: You're staying put. ",
        "Ben: Arianna, I'm taking you home! ",
        "Arianna: I'm not going anywhere with you ever again. My place is with my \r\nhusband now. ",
        "Ben: Married? ",
        "Arianna: We were married today. ",
        "Eve: I thought you told me you two were just good friends. ",
        "Ian: Well, that's what we told everybody because, um, Arianna's family \r\ndidn't want us to be together. ",
        "Eve: I see. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, I knew there was something going on. I kept seeing you at this \r\nman's house. I should have known you were sharing the same bed together. \r\nArianna, you have no morals! None! ",
        "Ian: You watch your mouth! That's my wife you're talking about and the sooner \r\nyou and your family find out about that, the better. ",
        "Ben: Oh, yeah, this marriage is just some kind of scam to keep Arianna in \r\nthis country. I know it is. ",
        "Arianna: We got married because we want to be together. ",
        "Eve: So you're -- in love. ",
        "Ian: Yes, I am. I'm in love. I didn't mean for it to happen, but when it did \r\nit was the most beautiful thing in the world. For both of us. I never met a \r\nwoman with so much heart and courage. ",
        "Arianna: Ian came at a time in my life when I had nothing. ",
        "Ian: We were both looking for someone, and we found what we needed in each \r\nother. ",
        "Eve: This is real, isn't it? ",
        "Ian: The way I feel right now for the woman I love is more real than anything \r\nI've ever felt in my life. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Times I spent with you were the most important times of my life. ",
        "Livvie: Look, if that's true, then why did you tear into me the way you did \r\nat the river? Why did you say that I never meant anything to you at all? ",
        "Jack: Because I was bringing you so much pain, all right, and I hated that. \r\nSo I wanted to make a clean break. ",
        "Livvie: You could have just told me that instead of ripping my heart out. ",
        "Jack: No, there was no other way. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I know what it's like to have messed-up parents, but that's in \r\nthe past and it doesn't have to ruin the rest of your life just because your \r\nfather abandoned you. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, my father didn't abandon me. Chris did. See, I was just \r\na kid. I trusted him. I even looked up to him, if you can imagine that. But he \r\njust \r\ndecided to dump me off with strangers and be on his way. Just bounced around \r\nfrom foster home to foster home, never really connected with any families, but \r\n-- got to admit, they were all happy to see me go. ",
        "Livvie: God, I am so sorry. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, I just want Chris to know what it feels like to lose \r\nsomething important to him. He took my family, so I took you, which was the \r\nbiggest mistake of my life. ",
        "Livvie: God. So many things make sense to me now that didn't before. ",
        "Jack: I'm the reason we're not together. All right? It wasn't you. You did \r\nnothing wrong. You did everything right. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: So, I suppose Mrs. Dr. Collins will be joining you on the slope for \r\nwhat, a little second honeymoon? ",
        "Kevin: I'm not discussing Eve with you. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you might as well because I'll just keep hounding you until you \r\ncrack. Or you know what? I think I'm just going to light my candle again. ",
        "Kevin: Eve and I are taking a few days off. Let's just leave it at that. ",
        "Lucy: Really? I thought you two were joined at the hip. ",
        "Kevin: Will you stop pestering me? ",
        "Lucy: Probably not. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I get it. You're planning to bore me to sleep so you can slip the \r\nconductor in here for a little action. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! You're right. You got me. I've already had him, though. You know, \r\nin fact, I've had half the men on this train. I thought I'd maybe finish up the \r\nrest of them by breakfast. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, let's hope you just stick to those who are of age this time.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh! Aha! ",
        "Kevin: Aha, what? ",
        "Lucy: I was wondering when you'd get around to bringing up what happened with \r\nJack. ",
        "Kevin: \"What happened with Jack?\" You make it sound like your clothes just \r\nmagically fell off, you tripped, and landed on his hmm-mm-mm. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! How dare you. You are not allowed to speak to me like that. You \r\nknow what? Everybody told me before I met you you were a stick in the mud, and \r\nnow -- I've never really seen it, but I get to. I get to see you in full \r\nstick-in-the-mud mode. Let me tell you something, pal -- it isn't very \r\nflattering. Not at all! ",
        "Kevin: Well, you started it. I was just sitting here happily reading, minding \r\nmy own damn business, but that's just not enough for you, is it? You just don't \r\nhave the word \"stop\" in your vocabulary because you just have to push, push, \r\npush, push, push. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! I do not know why you're here. ",
        "Kevin: Push, push, push, push, push! ",
        "Lucy: Because last I heard, you were supposed to be running off with your \r\nlittle wifey to make happy-happy. But what happened? Did Eve sort of get tired \r\nof your stick-in-the-mud persona, too? Or maybe, better yet, she really actually \r\nran off with Ian this time. Oh, Doc, no. How could she do something like that to \r\nyou? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Well, this is your wedding night, and I'm sorry I barged in with hothead \r\nhere. Um -- congratulations are in order, right? Congratulations. Hey. Wow. ",
        "Ian: Thank you, Eve. Thank you. ",
        "Eve: I wish you both the best. I really do. If anyone deserves to be happy, \r\nit's you, Ian. Take good care of him, ok? ",
        "Officer: Sheriff's department. ",
        "Ian: I'm glad you're here. This is the man who assaulted Dr. Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Yes, and I would be happy to make a statement. He is one hotheaded boy.\r\n",
        "Officer: All right, buddy, let's go. ",
        "Arianna: Wait. I want you and the family to give me your blessings. ",
        "Ben: If this marriage is genuine, you'll have my blessing. ",
        "Officer: Come on. ",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry. I'm just so tired. Can we please go home? ",
        "Ian: Sure. Why don't you wait in the car, ok? Be one minute. ",
        "Arianna: It was nice to see you again. ",
        "Eve: Well, party's over. I guess I should go. ",
        "Ian: Not yet. You haven't told me why you came looking for me. ",
        "Eve: I -- heard you disappeared. Thought you might be in trouble, so I \r\nthought I would come riding to your rescue for a change instead of the other way \r\naround. And yet, here you are, coming to my rescue once again. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'm up for that challenge any day. ",
        "Eve: That's good to know. ",
        "Ian: So, we both had weddings today. Fancy that. How was your ceremony? ",
        "Eve: Oh, you should have stuck around. It was a real tearjerker. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Well, Kevin can't be happy with you. You renewed your vows and \r\nthen you came looking for me. ",
        "Eve: Well, you know Kevin. He's very understanding. You know, in fact, I \r\nshould get back to him. ",
        "Ian: One more thing. Why'd you come looking for me here in this cabin? We \r\nwere here during the period of time that you say you don't remember. Or do you? \r\nDo you remember what happened here? ",
        "Eve: Nope. I don't. I read about this place in the police report and I just \r\nthought you might have come here. Pretty lucky, huh? I found you. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. Well, maybe the next time you come to rescue me, bring a couple of \r\nburly guys with you. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Eve: You better get back to your wife. I hope you'll be as happy -- I hope \r\nyou'll be happy. ",
        "Ian: Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Yes? ",
        "",
        "Jack: Livvie, I never meant to hurt you. You got to believe that. ",
        "Livvie: You had your reasons for the things you did and I understand that. \r\nBut it doesn't change the fact that you hurt me. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. You're standing up for yourself. That's -- that's good. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, it's about time, right? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Look, I'll never forget the times we spent together. I mean, I'm \r\na better person for knowing you. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, you take care of yourself, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. You, too. ",
        "[Livvie sighs] ",
        "Livvie: Goodbye, Jack. ",
        "Conductor: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you don't have a ticket, do you? ",
        "Jack: Uh, no -- my things are in my compartment. I -- ",
        "Conductor: Save it for the cops. They'll decide what to do with you at the \r\nnext station. Meanwhile, you're not going anywhere. ",
        "[Jack sighs] ",
        "",
        "Eve's Voice: I want to be with you. I've known it since Christmas Eve. I \r\nthink I've known it longer than that -- when we were kidnapped and thrown \r\ntogether. And I just tried so hard to fight those feelings. I think we were \r\nmeant to be together. We had no other choice but to fall in love. ",
        "Arianna: Are you ready to leave this place behind? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I was just making sure the fire was out completely. ",
        "Arianna: It must have killed you to tell Eve you're in love with someone \r\nelse, to look at her and lie. ",
        "Ian: Had to be done. Besides, Eve has her own life to get back to -- a loving \r\nhusband. ",
        "Arianna: I'm just so sorry you've been put in this position. ",
        "Ian: Was my idea. ",
        "Arianna: While Ben is around, we're going to have to make him believe this \r\nmarriage is real. So we're going to have to convince everyone that we're happy \r\nnewlyweds. ",
        "Ian: I know. I made a commitment. I'm sticking to it. ",
        "Arianna: I just wish there had been some other way. ",
        "Ian: Goodbye, Eve. I love you. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian. I took too long. I took too long to remember. Now I've lost you. I've \r\nlost you. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry I said anything about Eve and Ian. You know, I was just sort \r\nof taking a shot in the dark. Is -- is that what happened, Doc? Did Eve run off \r\nwith Ian? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know, exactly, but my bride took a hike somewhere. Seems like \r\nI should care more about that, but right now I don't. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm very sorry because I know how much you wanted your marriage \r\nto work. ",
        "Kevin: Well, let's just say that lately I'm not thinking straight about \r\nanything. I didn't want to talk to Eve. I didn't want to talk to you. All I \r\nwanted to do was glide down some snowy slope. The way my luck is going, I'll \r\nprobably run right into a tree. ",
        "Lucy: You know, maybe the universe is just trying to tell you something. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, can it, Lucy! I'm not interested in hearing about your mystical \r\nwoo-woo. And I'm not interested in hearing yet again how the universe has thrown \r\nus together so we can live happily ever after. As far as I'm concerned, the \r\nuniverse is as screwed up as I am. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Well, let me tell you, Mr. Dr. Know-it-all, that's not even what I \r\nwas going to say. And you better be careful pooh-poohing the universe because she \r\nwill bite you back. ",
        "Kevin: You don't think she already has? My wife is off God knows where, my \r\nvow renewal ceremony was as close to a funeral as I'll get to while I'm alive, \r\nand you and I are at each other's throats! ",
        "Lucy: That is what I mean by the universe. Maybe the universe did this on \r\npurpose, threw us together so we could see what it'd really be like if we were \r\ngetting back together. Well, let me tell you! This is not a pretty picture. ",
        "Kevin: What, oh, what will it take to shut you up? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Do you know you get very rude when you're hiding your real, true \r\nfeelings? Rudeness just rears its ugly head. ",
        "Kevin: Will you shut up! ",
        "Lucy: Make me. ",
        "Kevin: Fine! \r\n\u00a0",
