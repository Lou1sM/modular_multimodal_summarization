        "Chris: You mind telling me what you're doing? ",
        "Amy: I can explain. ",
        "Chris: Really? That'd be great because I would love an explanation because \r\nthis just keeps getting better and better by the minute. I mean, first you deny \r\nthat I ever saw you in Philadelphia all those years ago. And then when I come up \r\nwith a photo proving otherwise, you deny that it's you in the picture, even \r\nthough you're not able to see it. And now I catch you rummaging through my \r\nlocker, trying to steal that very same photograph. ",
        "Amy: I was borrowing it to see if anyone else agreed -- ",
        "Chris: No, please, Amy. Why don't you save us both the time and trouble and \r\njust tell me the truth? ",
        "Amy: I don't have to tell you anything. ",
        "Chris: No, you don't, but you might want to anyway because once I start \r\ndigging in that closet of yours, who knows what kind of skeletons will fall out?\r\n",
        "Amy: Fine. So you're saying I have no choice. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, that's pretty much it. ",
        "Amy: But, actually, I do, Chris. I have two choices -- I can tell you \r\neverything there is to know about me. Or I could kill you. ",

        "Rafe: He hasn't come out of the coma yet? ",
        "Livvie: No, and he's running out of time. If he doesn't wake up soon, he's --\r\n",
        "Alison: Don't, no, don't say that, ok? He's going to be ok. He will. He \r\nreally will. ",
        "Livvie: But it's going to take a miracle. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, then there's just going to have to be one. Tell her, Rafe, \r\nyou're an angel. Tell her there's going to be a miracle. ",

        "Eve: That seizure never should've happened. ",
        "Ian: We knew it was a risk. ",
        "Eve: Yes, we did. But now you put him in a coma, one he may never come out \r\nof. ",
        "Ian: If I didn't, he'd be dead by now. ",
        "Eve: That's your opinion. ",
        "Ian: Can we have this debate later? I got a patient to save. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Hey, you. You listen to me. You are not going anywhere. Do you hear \r\nme? You're not going anywhere because I need you to stay right here with me. \r\nThat's what you're going to do. Please. ",

        "Paige: It's time for you to leave this world, my love, and cross over to the \r\nnext. I'm here to help you. ",
        "Kevin: I don't understand. How are you supposed to help me cross over? ",

        "Rafe: Think. Angels don't know who or when someone's going to die. And even \r\nif they did, like I told you both already, I don't have my powers. I'm sorry. \r\nI'm just here on a pass. ",
        "Livvie: So you can't help me. ",
        "Rafe: I can help you pray. ",

        "Ed's Voice: Rafe, my boy, it is not easy being an angel. The jobs we do are \r\nvery tough. But sometimes we're called upon to make it easier for people. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: All I'm saying, if it's a friend, then I just think that -- ",
        "Ed's Voice: Ok, that's enough. You should all be concentrating on getting \r\nback down again and covering yourselves because you've been missing long enough \r\nas it is. Also remember what I told you -- every choice you make affects other \r\nlives, so make that choice carefully. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: Whoa. Are you saying that we could have something to do with \r\nthis death? ",
        "Ed's Voice: You have all been allowed to be human again. And as any other \r\nhuman, you can't possibly know the future. You live the time you have, and you \r\nshall complete your journeys the best you can. ",

        "Livvie: It's just not fair. You know, he was just telling me the other day \r\nhow happy he was and how he finally had everything he ever wanted with Lucy and \r\na family. What reason could there possibly be for this? ",
        "Rafe: Livvie, I don't know, but just know that this isn't the end, ok? You \r\nunderstand that, right? This world down here, it's just a stop along the road.\r\n",

        "Rafe: What do you mean? ",
        "Alison: You weren't just lifting up Livvie's spirits back there. You were \r\npreparing her. ",

        "Lucy: Ok, listen. If you're not ready to wake up just right at this exact \r\nmoment, you know, I'm ok with that. I mean, everybody's ok with that, \r\nconsidering everything you've been through. You know, maybe your mind and your \r\nbody just needed a little downtime, a little rest, and that's ok because I'm \r\ngoing to stay right here by your side waiting -- waiting till you wake up. But \r\nin the meantime, I'm going to remind you how much I love you. Have I also told \r\nyou lately how much I love being your wife? I can never tell you that enough. \r\nDoc, I've never been happier in my whole entire life and it's because of you. We \r\nare going to go right on being happy, too, because you're going to wake up, and \r\nwe're going to follow the path that we've been meant to follow all this time \r\ntogether. And it's going to get better and better, and we're going to be happier \r\nand happier. So all you have to do is wake up because it's going to be amazing. \r\nI promise. I promise. ",

Wait \r\ntill you see how wonderful it can be. You'll feel like -- well, you'll feel like \r\nwe did in the old days. We were young and carefree and so impossibly happy it \r\ndidn't seem real. Do you remember, Kevin? Do you remember how in love we once \r\nwere? That's why I came back. I realize that now. I came back because I love \r\nyou. I never stopped loving you. ",

I just thought we need the rest, so we \r\nwent back to the hotel and fell in the bed and fell right to sleep. And I had my \r\nusual dreams. The dream I always have about my sexy, amazing, handsome husband. \r\nYou know what I dreamed? It was amazing. It was our wedding anniversary. But, \r\nDoc, it wasn't our first or second. It was our 40th. 4-0. There we were, this \r\nlittle gray-haired, elderly couple, surrounded by all the people we love. Our \r\nkids were there and all these grandkids. They were so beautiful. And we looked \r\naround, we looked at each other and realized how blessed we were. We were so \r\nlucky and amazed to have each other and to have created this life. Do you know \r\nwhat was the most awesome part of that dream was you. You -- you reached down \r\nand you took my hand, and then you kissed it, and I felt that kiss all the way \r\ndown to my toes. Just like it felt the first time you kissed me. Just like I \r\nfeel it every single time you still kiss me. Doc, don't you see, in order for \r\nthat dream to come true, you -- you have to come back to me? You have to wake up \r\nand come back. So do it. Doc, listen to me. Do it.
