        "Frank: Perfect. I'll be off in five minutes. ",
        "Karen: Ok. I'll see you soon. ",

        "Alison: So you're really going to take it? ",
        "Frank: Take what? ",
        "Alison: Um, Jamal -- he got a job on the movie that they're filming in Port \r\nCharles. ",
        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Alison: He's a -- uh, well -- ",
        "Jamal: I'm a gofer. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. But, hey, you know, it's cool. It's -- it's money, right, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Alison: Jamal, you really -- you don't have to take this. All right? I can \r\ncover bills until you find something else, really. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I have found something, ok? Everything's cool. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: All right. I'll call you later. ",
        "Alison: All right. Bye. ",
        "Jamal: Bye. ",
        "Alison: Good luck. This so bites! This job is so beneath him.\r\n",
        "Frank: Hey, you have to start somewhere. ",
        "Alison: No, there's got to be something else out there that Jamal could \r\nreally be into, you know? If I could just help him figure out what that is. ",

        "Lucy: Look -- look, whatever happened, I mean, all that happened last night \r\n-- I just want you to know, don't get any ideas because nothing has changed. I \r\nam still absolutely furious with you! ",
        "Kevin: Good. I feel the same way about you! ",
        "Lucy: Well, good! ",
        "Kevin: Oh, how did this happen? ",

        "Frank: In diet cola? ",
        "Alison: It's just really bumming me out seeing Jamal work such a totally lame \r\njob. ",
        "Frank: I know, but -- ",
        "Alison: I mean, he's better than that. Don't you think? ",
        "Frank: Sure. I think that -- ",
        "Alison: I mean, come on. He's responsible, he's quick on his feet, he's \r\nsmart. He should be able to utilize one of those qualities, right? ",
        "Frank: Well, sometimes -- ",
        "Alison: It's not like he doesn't have a lot to offer. He really does, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Frank: Look, I know how you value my input, but I'm headed to the auction.\r\n",
        "Alison: Auction? Wait, what auction? ",
        "Frank: Oh, it's -- it's no big deal, just a charity thing P.C. High is \r\nputting on in their cafeteria. ",
        "Alison: Oh, cool! I love going through people's stuff. I'll go with you. ",
        "Frank: But, I -- ",
        "Alison: Oh, this is perfect! Frank, now I don't have to sit around here and \r\nfeel sorry for myself and get depressed all day long. You've totally saved me. \r\nThank you. ",
        "Frank: No problem. ",
        "Alison: Ok. So I'll just go get my coat. Ok, ok. ",

        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Scott: Yeah, she's moving back. ",
        "Karen: And guess what else. My mom and Scott will be joining us for the \r\nauction. ",
        "Scott: Is that ok with you, Frankie? ",
        "Frank: Hey, that's fantastic. The more, the merrier. ",
        "Rhonda: Hey, do we have time for a soda before we leave? I'm a little parched \r\nfrom the airplane. ",
        "Scott: Yeah. We'll get a couple of lemonades. ",
        "Rhonda: Good. Great. ",
        "Frank: You guys, find a table. Hey, could you get these guys something to \r\ndrink? Thanks. ",
        "Karen: Frank, I am so sorry. She just came in and invited -- ",
        "Frank: No, no, no, it's ok. I actually got myself in the same situation. ",
        "Karen: What do you mean? ",

        "Karen: Well, this is turning out to be quite a date. ",

        "Karen: Yeah. It just took me by surprise. That's for sure. ",
        "",
        "Rhonda: I don't think it was a good idea me surprising Karen like this. ",
        "Scott: Why do you say that? ",
        "Rhonda: I don't know. Maybe I should just go handle the project in our \r\noverseas office. ",
        "Scott: No. What are you talking about? ",
        "Rhonda: Well, I mean, you have to admit, she didn't exactly seem happy to \r\nhave me back in town. ",
        "Scott: Rhonda, she was just surprised to see you. That's all. ",
        "Rhonda: Hmm, no, I don't think so. I think she resents me for not being here \r\nwhen she was going through her rehab, you know? ",
        "Scott: Well, if that's the case, then you need to stick around and spend some \r\ntime with her. ",
        "Rhonda: Well, ok. I hope you're right about that. ",
        "Scott: I'm always right, Rhonda. You know that. ",

        "Scott: She's also my overseas secretary. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, maybe we should get out of here before everything is picked \r\nover. ",
        "Rhonda: Hey, do not worry about that. If there's anything decent to be found \r\nat a rummage sale, I'm going to uncover it. ",
        "Karen: Mom, this is more of a charity auction. There's no rummaging. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh. Well, whatever, you know? There's always these great treasures to \r\nbe found. Let's go. ",

        "Frank: No! No, come on! I want to know. ",
        "Karen: Well, all right. Um -- first, I saw us walking together, just the two \r\nof us. ",
        "Frank: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Karen: Walking and talking and laughing and pointing at all these weird \r\nthings. And maybe we'd find something that we both had when we were kids like \r\nAtari or something. ",
        "Frank: Yeah? ",
        "Karen: And then you'd surprise me and buy it for me. What I didn't see was my \r\nmom coming into town out of nowhere and it just kind of threw me for a loop. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. Well, you know what threw me? You spending my money in your \r\nfantasy. Now I've got to live up to that. ",
        "Karen: No, you don't. ",
        "Frank: No, no. You pick out whatever you want in here and I'll put the \r\nhighest bid on it. ",
        "Karen: Thanks, but I can't let you do that. ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry. This is non-negotiable. ",
        "Karen: Ok. ",
        "Frank: Hmm? ",
        "Karen: Fine. Let's see. Hmm. ",
        "Karen: Oh, I'm stuck. ",
        "Frank: Oh. Here, let me -- let me. You know, I think this old relic wants you \r\nto take it home. ",
        "Karen: This thing? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. It's -- oh, it's cool. I was checking it out earlier. There. ",
        "Karen: Oh. Thanks. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: So you -- you really think I should get this thing? ",
        "Frank: Why not? It could be fun. ",
        "Karen: It probably doesn't even work. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you know, I'll bet we could get it running and who knows what \r\nkind of fun stuff we could find on it like government secrets or somebody's old \r\nnovel. ",
        "Karen: Well, I guess it is the next best thing to Atari. Actually, it's \r\nnothing like Atari. ",
        "Frank: No. ",
        "Karen: But you know what? It's kitsch and it's funky and I love it. ",
        "Frank: We aim to please, ma'am. ",
        "Karen: Well, you please very much. ",

        "Kevin: Well, this is it, next stop coming up. ",
        "Lucy: So, what, you're just going to get off and take the next train back to \r\nPort Charles? ",
        "Kevin: Yep. What about you? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I'm going to go on. You know, I'm going to go to the spa. I -- I \r\nreally do need to get away. ",
        "Kevin: Get away or run away? ",
        "Lucy: Well, this running away business never seems to work for either one of \r\nus, you know? We just seem to run right back to each other. Um, listen, I think \r\nyou need to get home. I think it's good. You need to talk to Eve because despite \r\nwhat's happened, she is still your wife. ",
        "Kevin: And you and I need to put some distance between us while I can sort \r\nthis out. ",
        "Lucy: Right. And then, you know, we'll see. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I know. I know. You don't need to say it. I know there are lots \r\nand lots of obstacles. ",
        "Kevin: Seems like there have always been obstacles. ",
        "Lucy: You're right. It seems like we've just never quite been able to work it \r\nout. Maybe we never will. ",
        "Kevin: It's starting to look that way. ",
        "Lucy: Well, one thing we can do, though, Doc, is stop hurting each other. I \r\nmean, what -- what happened between us last night -- ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know. It can never happen again. ",
        "Lucy: No, it can never happen again and it won't happen. I -- I mean it this \r\ntime. ",
        "Kevin: I think we both really mean it this time. \r\n\u00a0",

        "Frank: Does that include me? ",
        "Ian: We got married. ",
        "Kevin: When you were gone, I was lost. I managed to find my way back -- to \r\nLucy. "
