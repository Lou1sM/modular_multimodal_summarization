        "Karen: Frank? ",
        "Frank: Yeah? ",
        "Karen: Are you sure this is the right thing? ",
        "Frank: It's a little late for second thoughts. ",
        "Karen: You're right. We can't stop now. ",
        "Frank: Then let's not. Besides, we're almost there. ",
        "Karen: Ugh. ",
        "Frank: Whew. ",
        "",
        "Ian: You ok? ",
        "Arianna: I'm your wife. This is our home. It's just -- ",
        "Ian: It's just what? ",
        "Arianna: It's ok. I'll get used to it. This can't be how you imagined \r\nbringing your bride home. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'm sure that it's not how you imagined it, either. ",
        "Arianna: I was wondering if -- ",
        "Ian: Wondering if what? ",
        "Arianna: If this isn't a mistake. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: You ok? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I'm fine. You? ",
        "Kevin: Fine. Sorry, Eve. I don't know what to say. I didn't expect to find \r\nyou here. ",
        "Eve: Well, that's a good place to start -- the fact that you're surprised to \r\nsee your wife at home. ",
        "",
        "Frank: There. This is perfect. ",
        "Karen: You think so? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. Look, there's even an outlet. Hey, what do you say we fire this \r\npuppy up, huh? ",
        "Karen: Oh, unplug it, quickly, before it blows! Quick! Oh! ",
        "Frank: I wonder what was up with that. ",
        "Karen: You know, maybe it just doesn't work. ",
        "Frank: Well, we can get it fixed. ",
        "Karen: Maybe we could put it somewhere else till then. ",
        "Frank: You want me to move it again? ",
        "Karen: If it's not too much trouble. ",
        "Frank: No problem. Where do you want it? ",
        "Karen: How about the patio? ",
        "Frank: What? I didn't catch that. ",
        "Karen: How about over there by the window? ",
        "Frank: Ok, if that's where you want it. ",
        "Frank: Oh! Ugh. ",
        "Karen: Frank! ",
        "Frank: Oh. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: Was this a big mistake? ",
        "Ian: We had no choice. ",
        "Arianna: I needed you to marry me, but you didn't have to. ",
        "Ian: Unless I wanted to see you deported. ",
        "Arianna: You barely know me. ",
        "Ian: I know you well enough to know that once they got you home they would've \r\nmurdered you, and I wasn't going to stand for it. ",
        "Arianna: Even if it means marrying a stranger? ",
        "Ian: Even if. Enough said, ok? ",
        "Arianna: No. Wait. There's just one more thing I have to say. No one has ever \r\ndone so much for me, sacrificed so much. ",
        "Ian: There are worse things than marrying a beautiful woman. ",
        "Arianna: Unless you're in love with someone else. ",
        "Ian: Your brother is going to be out of the way for a while. But he won't be \r\nin jail forever, and once he's out he'll come looking for you. ",
        "Arianna: But you heard what he said. He'll leave me alone if he believes \r\nwe're really married. ",
        "Ian: Well, so let's make him believe it, along with everybody else. ",
        "Arianna: Including Eve? ",
        "Ian: Let's not talk about her. We're going to make people believe we're \r\nnewlyweds. All right, first things first -- to get you a wedding ring. ",
        "Arianna: Oh, it's not necessary. ",
        "Ian: No, it is necessary. If we're married, you need a ring. ",
        "Arianna: Of course. ",
        "Ian: And you'll have to change your name. ",
        "Arianna: Mrs. Ian Thornhart. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Ian: It's open. ",
        "Joe: Hey. Thought we heard voices down here. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Gabriela: Arianna. You're all right! ",
        "Arianna: Yes, I'm fine, thanks to Ian. ",
        "Gabriela: We were so worried about you when you disappeared from the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry I left you to deal with my brother. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, no, I'm just glad you're ok. ",
        "Ian: Yes, we both are. In fact, we have an announcement to make. ",
        "Joe: Yeah? ",
        "Ian: Well, we -- we got very close and we got married. ",
        "",
        "Eve: It's never been this hard to talk to you. ",
        "Kevin: I know. ",
        "Eve: Even when we hardly knew each other. ",
        "Kevin: But we're not strangers now. ",
        "Eve: It just feels that way. ",
        "Kevin: But we're not. We care about each other, Eve. Despite everything \r\nthat's happened, we still care about each other and we have to talk this out.\r\n",
        "Eve: You're right. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. You left me to be with Ian. ",
        "Eve: I'm sorry if I hurt you. You know, I never meant to. ",
        "Kevin: Just tell me the truth, Eve. ",
        "Eve: I would have told you the truth had I known it myself. ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? ",
        "Eve: I told you that there were parts of Ian and I being kidnapped that I \r\ndidn't remember. ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Eve: When we were saying our vows to each other the other day -- ",
        "Kevin: Your memory came back. ",
        "Eve: Ian and I were held hostage for a long time, and we spent every minute \r\nof every day together. And we depended on each other for so much. I was so \r\nscared, and I wasn't thinking straight half the time. ",
        "Kevin: Eve, are you trying to tell me that you and Ian had an affair? ",
        "Eve: No. No. I couldn't. I was still married to you. ",
        "Kevin: But something did happen between you. ",
        "Eve: It was a difficult time. We didn't know whether we were going to live or \r\ndie. ",
        "Kevin: Well, people can become close in a situation like that. ",
        "Eve: It was more than that. I fell in love with Ian. I'm so sorry. I never, \r\never meant to hurt you. I tried so hard to fight it, Kevin. You were everything \r\nto me. You were the perfect husband and -- ",
        "Kevin: It wasn't just you, Eve. ",
        "Eve: But -- ",
        "Kevin: You're not the only one who broke a wedding vow. ",
        "Eve: What are you saying? ",
        "Kevin: When you were gone, I was lost. I managed to find my way back. I found \r\nmy way back to Lucy. ",
        "",
        "Karen: Will you please hold still? ",
        "Frank: I don't need you to look at it. ",
        "Karen: I am a doctor. ",
        "Frank: And I'm a paramedic, and I say it's fine. Hmm. Ok, maybe I could use \r\nsome ice. ",
        "Karen: Will you please let me check it? ",
        "Karen: Do you feel anything? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: Pain? ",
        "Frank: No. ",
        "Karen: How about that? ",
        "Frank: Ah -- ooh, ow. What are you doing? ",
        "Karen: Trying to figure out what's wrong with you -- your knee, anyway. ",
        "Frank: It's just an old football injury. ",
        "Karen: Or a new sprain. Better get you that ice. ",
        "Frank: Ah. That's what I get for buying you a present. ",
        "Karen: Such a humongous one, anyway. ",
        "Frank: Well, I could've gotten you the Chia Pet or that -- that disco ball.\r\n",
        "Karen: You know, I really had a lot of fun at the auction. ",
        "Frank: Oh, yeah, I could tell you were having the time of your life. ",
        "Karen: It just caught me off guard seeing my mom, that's all. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. How you doing with that? ",
        "Karen: I love her. I do, but -- ",
        "Frank: History. I know. ",
        "Karen: It was such a nightmare growing up with her drinking and -- ",
        "Frank: Yeah, tell me about it. My dad was the reason Joe and I were always \r\nhanging out on the street. ",
        "Karen: You know, I bet you probably don't remember me tagging along with you \r\nguys. You know, you were the cool older brother, and I was that -- ",
        "Frank: Joe's scrawny little friend. ",
        "Karen: Thanks. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. So you thought I was cool, huh? ",
        "Karen: You were ok. ",
        "Frank: \"Ok?\" ",
        "Karen: Ok, I thought you were kind of cute -- once, a long time ago. ",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? I thought you were pretty cute, too, for a \r\nscrawny little kid. Oh, ow! Ok! ",
        "Karen: Never insult a doctor when she's treating you. ",
        "Frank: Did you ever think you'd wind up being a doctor? ",
        "Karen: It was my dream. But you know, I almost blew it. ",
        "Frank: But you didn't. You went into rehab, you're in recovery. You're doing \r\ngreat. ",
        "Karen: Well, I thought I was. And then, surprise, Mom's back. I guess \r\nanything that rocks the boat scares me. ",
        "Frank: Does that include me? ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Congratulations. We're just so surprised. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, it's -- it's unbelievable. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. When did this happen? ",
        "Ian: Last night. ",
        "Joe: Well, we should celebrate. How about you and I go upstairs and see if we \r\ncan find something to toast with? ",
        "Ian: Sure. See you in a minute. ",
        "Arianna: Why are you looking at me like that? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, we both know your brother was trying to have you deported.\r\n",
        "Arianna: Yes, and Ian rescued me. ",
        "Gabriela: By marrying you? ",
        "Arianna: No. We fell in love. ",
        "Gabriela: Arianna, you can trust me, ok? If you need somebody to talk to --\r\n",
        "Arianna: Ian and I may have not married for the same reasons other couples \r\ndo. But we care about each other. I know he doesn't feel exactly the same way \r\nabout me, but I can make him happy. And I will. ",
        "",
        "Joe: Look, why don't you cut the bull here, Ian. ",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? ",
        "Joe: You know what I'm talking about. You married someone you just met. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Happens all the time. ",
        "Joe: No, no, not to a guy who's still in love with someone else. ",
        "Ian: I don't want to talk about that. ",
        "[Joe sighs] ",
        "Joe: Eve. Her name is Eve, Ian. And, correct me if I'm wrong, you're still in \r\nlove with her. ",
        "Ian: I know what her name is. And it's over. ",
        "Joe: Come on, Ian. I mean, you got to know by now you can trust me. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: Have you ever heard of an honor killing? ",
        "Joe: Yeah, I've read about it. ",
        "Ian: Well, that's what was going to happen to Arianna. ",
        "Joe: Why? ",
        "Ian: Because she was raped, and her family blames her for it. They want her \r\ndead. And I wasn't going to let that happen. ",
        "Joe: So you married her? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, before her brother was going to deport her. ",
        "Joe: Oh. Now what? ",
        "Ian: Now we're going to make everyone believe that we're happily married. ",
        "Joe: For how long? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. ",
        "Joe: You don't know? You're talking marriage here, Ian. ",
        "Ian: Yes, I know, Joseph. But it's in name only. No one's heart's on the line \r\nhere. ",
        "",
        "Eve: You got back together with Lucy? ",
        "Kevin: I thought you were dead. ",
        "Eve: Now it all makes sense -- the things that she said. It's still going on, \r\nisn't it? ",
        "Kevin: No, but the feelings -- those old feelings are still there. ",
        "Eve: Maybe they never went away. ",
        "Kevin: Maybe. I don't know. But once you came back -- talk about guilt, \r\nhating myself. ",
        "Eve: Kevin, don't, ok? It's not your fault. You didn't know I was still \r\nalive. ",
        "Kevin: But you were. You were, and I -- ",
        "Eve: Didn't know. It's ok. You didn't do anything wrong. ",
        "Kevin: You know what? Neither did you. ",
        "Eve: This is a big mess, isn't it? ",
        "Kevin: Why aren't you with Ian? ",
        "Eve: Because he's -- he's -- ",
        "Kevin: He's what? What -- what happened? ",
        "Eve: He's -- he's married. ",
        "Kevin: He's married? ",
        "Eve: It just happened. ",
        "Kevin: I -- I don't follow. Who did he marry? ",
        "Eve: Nobody you know. Doesn't matter. ",
        "Kevin: It does to you. ",
        "Eve: Well, some things just weren't meant to be. ",
        "Kevin: You don't believe that. ",
        "Eve: Kevin, Ian is married now, and I'd like to ask you a really big favor. I \r\ndon't want him to know -- him or anyone -- that I remembered what happened between \r\nus. ",
        "Kevin: Eve -- ",
        "Eve: Please. Kevin, please. ",
        "Kevin: All right. If that's what you want. ",
        "Eve: It is. ",
        "Kevin: Let me ask you something now. If Ian weren't married, would you be \r\nwith him right now? ",
        "Eve: I ruined everything, didn't I? I really messed up.",

        "Karen: You're not. ",
        "Frank: Are you sure? ",
        "Karen: Positive. I'd better get you an ice pack. Oh. ",

        "Karen: Oh, God. Thanks. Um -- you know, you better get that weight off your \r\nknee. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. You know, that's the second time that computer has reached out \r\nand grabbed you. Maybe it's trying to tell you something. ",

        "Karen: Frank, I have to level with you on something. ",

        "Karen: I'm sorry. ",

        "Frank: Well, you know, it could've taken you a little longer to think about \r\nit. ",
        "Karen: Well, let's get one thing straight. I can come and visit it any time I \r\nwant. ",
