        "Amy: Well, I -- \n\n",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I mean, it was a pretty close call with Kevin, but, you\r\nknow, he's going to pull through, right? \n\n",
        "Eve: Yes, thank God. Ian got lucky this time. \n\n",
        "Chris: A well, putting Kevin in that coma was a pretty bold play. \n\n",
        "Eve: It was reckless. \n\n",
        "Chris: What do you expect from a guy who's used to practicing medicine in a\r\njungle? \n\n",
        "Eve: No, but, still, Ian should have known better, you know? If i weren't so\r\nshorthanded, I'd have him reassigned. Hey, speaking of being shorthanded, can\r\nyou fill in for Karen tonight? Because she's a little under the weather. \n\n",
        "Chris: No. No way. I'm taking your friend Amy out tonight. \n\n",
        "Eve: Oh, that's right. Where are you going to take her? \n\n",
        "Chris: Somewhere fancy, impressive. French, I think. \n\n",
        "Eve: Yeah, in other words, someplace where you can score? \n\n",
        "Chris: Let's just say I plan on getting very lucky tonight. \n\n",

        "Amanda: Then you're a liar as well as a thief. Well, you won't have my\r\ngranddaughter shielding you from the law. The police will deal with you. \n\n",

        "Jamal: Granny here wants to call the cops on me again -- \n\n",
        "Ricky: Whoa! No cops. I mean, it's probably my fault the necklace landed over\r\nhere anyway. I accidentally kicked your purse when the tea spilled, and the\r\nnecklace must have fallen out. \n\n",
        "Jamal: Wow. Funny how that probably happened, huh? \n\n",
        "Amanda: Well, that's just a little convenient here. Jamal appears and my\r\nnecklace disappears. \n\n",
        "Jack: Well, we really don't have any proof, do we? And now you have your\r\nnecklace back. What do you say we just kind of let it go? \n\n",

        "Rafe: Totally loveable? \n\n",
        "Alison: You know what? Maybe that's where I went wrong. I'm going home. I'm\r\ngoing back to being the selfish and materialistic person that I once was\r\nbecause, in all honesty, I was really good at it, ok? I mean, I was a genius\r\nshopper. Rafe, you didn't know me then, but I could spot cashmere at a distance\r\nof 50 feet away. I mean, that's fabulous. I even had a manicurist on retainer.\r\nCome on. As long as I had a credit card, life was so sweet. \n\n",

        "Eve: This has nothing to do with any of the other issues between us. This is\r\nabout you acting like a loose cannon in the trauma room, going off blindly on\r\nyour own without any regard for my opinion or my authority. \n\n",
