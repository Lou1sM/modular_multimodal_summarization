        "Lucy: Mmm, you have absolutely no idea how much I've needed this. ",
        "Masseur: You've got some major knots going here. Just try and relax. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. This hasn't exactly been my week or my month or even my \r\nyear. Mmm. ",
        "Masseur: You've left that all behind you now. Nothing here but peace and \r\nserenity. ",
        "Livvie: And me. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: Hi. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I decided to take you up on your offer and join you here at the \r\nspa, if it's still ok. ",
        "Lucy: Oh -- oh, gosh. Are you kidding? It's more than ok. It's terrific. You \r\nknow, I think you could really use some of this wonderful pampering yourself.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, especially since I ran into Jack on the train. ",
        "Lucy: You -- you saw Jack? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, we got stuck in the baggage car together. Long story, but we \r\nwere trapped there for a while. ",
        "Lucy: And for a while -- what do -- and what? ",
        "Livvie: And, well, he told me the truth -- the whole truth. ",
        "Lucy: Um, Hansy, could you just excuse us just for a minute? Don't go far, \r\nbut please, just for a minute? ",
        "Masseur: Of course. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Um -- so what exactly do you mean, the \r\nwhole truth? ",
        "Livvie: About how much he really cares. Look, I know you probably think I \r\nshould be furious with him and you probably think I'm an idiot, but, Lucy, he \r\nwas so sweet. I mean, we were freezing in there and he took off his coat just to \r\nkeep me warm. And then the next thing I knew -- ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Livvie, don't tell me you went to bed with Jack, too. ",
        "Livvie: What do you mean, \"too?\" Lucy, who else has Jack slept with? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Do you really think it's possible? We can turn back the clock to before \r\nI met -- before I met -- ",
        "[Eve sighs] ",
        "Kevin: Ian. ",
        "Kevin: I just think if we try, we can -- we can get past all the pain we've \r\ncaused each other. ",
        "Eve: But how? We loved each other so much. We stood here and recited our \r\nvows. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, we did love each other. ",
        "Eve: What happened, Kevin? Where did it all go wrong? Why wasn't loving each \r\nother enough? ",
        "Kevin: Don't do this. Don't do this, please. ",
        "",
        "Man: Satisfied? ",
        "Ian: That you're INS agents, yes. But you're still not going to question me \r\nor my wife without an attorney present. ",
        "Woman: Why would you need a lawyer if your marriage is real? ",
        "Man: Unless you're afraid that we'll find -- ",
        "Ian: I'm not afraid of anything, but I don't like people bursting in here and \r\ninvading our privacy. ",
        "Man: I'm sorry. We have a job to do. ",
        "Ian: If you think you're going to deport my wife -- ",
        "Woman: We can if we find out this marriage is a fake, and trust me, we will.\r\n",
        "Ian: Well, we have nothing to hide. Ask away. ",
        "Man: Oh, we will -- separately. ",
        "Woman: We can either do it here or downtown. It's your call. ",
        "Ian: Why don't you use our -- use our place downstairs. ",
        "Woman: Ok. Mrs. Thornhart? ",
        "Ian: Just tell the truth. ",
        "Man: Your marriage came at a very convenient time. ",
        "Ian: I didn't choose to fall in love, Mr. Martin. It just happened. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Lucy, you haven't answered me. Who else has Jack slept with? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I mean, you -- you know Jack. He has been around, Livvie. \r\nI'm sorry, he has a lot of experience. He's probably slept with a lot of women. \r\nBut that's not the point. The point is, you know, I'm just worried about you. I \r\nmean, I want you to be safe sex-wise and I really don't want you to get your \r\nheart broken. ",
        "Livvie: Well, first off, Jack is not like that, and, second, I did not sleep \r\nwith him. ",
        "Lucy: You didn't? ",
        "Livvie: What do you think, just because we were trapped in the baggage car \r\ntogether and Jack's really cute that I would just fall into his arms and start \r\nripping his clothes off? Please, I am not that weak. ",
        "Lucy: No, of course you're not. I mean, who would be? ",
        "Livvie: Well, you thought I was. ",
        "Lucy: No, no. No, I didn't. I just was really worried about you. I apologize. \r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I know you only want what's best for me. ",
        "Lucy: I do. I really do. Hey, I haven't even offered you anything to drink. \r\nThey have the best fresh carrot juice here. ",
        "Livvie: Thank you. Look, I'm really sorry for interrupting your massage like \r\nthis. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, no, no. It's ok. We are going to have plenty of time for lots \r\nof massages and pampering together. I'm very glad you're here. ",
        "Livvie: Me, too. ",
        "Lucy: Except for the fact you can't stop thinking about Jack. ",
        "Livvie: Well, every time I want to hate him, he does something really caring \r\nand loving and I just -- ",
        "Lucy: Cannot help yourself. ",
        "Livvie: Oh! All he has to do is touch me and I melt. But you probably know \r\nwhat that's like. Lucy, are you ok? Are you -- ",
        "Lucy: I'm fine. ",
        "Livvie: Are you ok? ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm just fine. It went down the wrong pipe, that's all. I just -- \r\nahem -- I -- I truly know what it's like to be really affected by someone you \r\nreally care about. Ahem. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and then on the other hand, he drives me totally nuts with all \r\nof his weird mixed messages. I don't know where I stand with the guy from one \r\nminute to the next. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Ok, well, in my experience with men, which has been rather \r\nextensive, I think the big picture here is that there are a lot of complications \r\nwith you and Jack. So maybe it would be best if you two just took some time off \r\nfor a while, you know, just at least for now. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, that's what I was afraid you'd say. ",
        "",
        "Woman: Your marriage to Dr. Thornhart -- did you think it would solve your \r\ndeportation problems? ",
        "Arianna: I married my husband so we could be together no matter what. ",
        "Woman: When did you first realize you had feelings for him? ",
        "Arianna: When I saw his compassion for someone who was injured. He was so \r\nkind and gentle and caring, like no man I'd ever known. ",
        "Woman: You talk about his compassion, how kind and gentle and caring he is, \r\nbut you never mention love. Do you love your husband? ",
        "Arianna: How can I not? There's so many ways he's special. ",
        "Woman: Special? How? ",
        "Arianna: Just the little things. Like how he asks for my opinion about things \r\nI'm sure he knows better than me, like I'm important. ",
        "Mr. Martin: Tell me about the first time you met. ",
        "Ian: The first time? Oh, I'll never forget it. ",
        "Mr. Martin: Fireworks, huh? ",
        "Ian: You could say that. ",
        "Ian's Voice: Your eyes dance when you're really angry. ",
        "Eve: Dr. Thornhart, we do not get to pick our colleagues. We're stuck with \r\neach other. ",
        "Ian: So it seems. ",
        "Eve: So I suggest that if you want to get along around here, you treat me \r\nlike a doctor. ",
        "Ian: I tried that. Didn't much like it, did you? ",
        "Mr. Martin: When exactly did you fall in love? ",
        "Ian: I don't know when exactly. Probably the first time I laid eyes on her. \r\nOnly I didn't know it then because, I mean, we were -- weren't real friendly. \r\nBut we grew to be friends, and next thing I knew, there was no turning back. ",
        "Mr. Martin: And all this took place over, what, a few weeks? It's pretty \r\namazing. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. 'Tis. It is. And now I can't imagine loving anyone else. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Maybe I just didn't try hard enough. ",
        "Kevin: But you did try. You tried. We both did. When we renewed our vows, we \r\nwere still trying. Eve? ",
        "Kevin: We were trying to revive what we felt here on this deck when we \r\npromised that we'd love each other forever. ",
        "Eve: I wanted that more than anything. ",
        "Kevin: I know. You just wanted it so much, it blocked out a part of your \r\nlife. The part where you fell in love with someone else. ",
        "Eve: I'm -- ",
        "Kevin: No, no. It's not just you, anyway. I was in my own kind of denial, \r\nEve. ",
        "Eve: With Lucy. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I just wound up being cruel to her, anyway. Pushed her out of my \r\nlife because I knew if she had any part in it -- well, she couldn't. Not if our \r\nmarriage was going to survive. ",
        "Eve: And it may have survived if I hadn't stopped the ceremony. If only I'd \r\ngone on -- ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no, don't do that. \"If onlys\" are killers. If only I'd been \r\nmore open when I first thought I might be Livvie's father. If only I'd turned to \r\nyou instead of Lucy. If only -- ",
        "Kevin: If only I'd known how much it was hurting you. ",
        "Eve: Don't do that, Kevin. Don't blame yourself, please. I let you down. And \r\nnow I am so afraid. ",
        "Kevin: Of what? ",
        "Eve: That you're going to hate me. Please don't hate me, Kevin. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Well, you're probably right about me and Jack. ",
        "Lucy: All I'm trying to say is just don't waste time on somebody who might \r\nnot be the one. Take it from somebody who knows. ",
        "Livvie: Are you talking about me and Jack now, or are you talking about you \r\nand Kevin? ",
        "Lucy: I guess both. ",
        "Livvie: Whatever happened with you guys, anyway? I mean, I thought you were \r\nfinally going to get your chance. ",
        "Lucy: It sure seemed that way for a minute, didn't it? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, then that night I came over and Jack was there, and Kevin \r\nseemed really upset about something. ",
        "Lucy: Yep. Doc was very upset. ",
        "Livvie: Well, why? Why did you do? ",
        "Lucy: I -- that night I just -- I happened to have made a very big mistake.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Well, you want to talk about it? ",
        "Lucy: No. No. I mean, you don't -- you do not want to know. Just suffice it \r\nto say it was a whopper. ",
        "Livvie: And Kevin won't forgive you? ",
        "Lucy: He said he forgave me, but I don't think he could ever forget. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Kind of like me with Jack. ",
        "Lucy: No. No. Come on, it's not like that at all because you're very young. \r\nYou know, you have lots and lots of time for many loves ahead. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and it still may work out with you and my dad. And if it \r\ndoesn't, I'm sure you're going to fall in love again. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, maybe, but I'm not so sure. ",
        "",
        "Ian: How much longer is she going to keep her down there? ",
        "Mr. Martin: I'd worry more about what's going on up here. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: His eyes -- they're the most lovely greenish hazel. And when he \r\nsmiles, they kind of sparkle. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Ian: Her eyes? Well, they're lovely, I can tell you that much. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Arianna: Ian doesn't like after-shave. He just smells like soap and Ian. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Ian: Come on, you, give me a break here. I don't know the name of her \r\nperfume. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Arianna: He loves steak, but he eats way too much of it. I'll have to do \r\nsomething about that. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Ian: She seems to like vegetables. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Woman: How did he propose? ",
        "Arianna: He said he wanted to take care of me and promised that he always \r\nwould, no matter what. ",
        "------------------------------",
        "Ian: Of course I intend to take care of her. She's my wife. That's why I \r\nmarried her. I love her very much. And I may not know every single detail about \r\nher, but I intend to find out in time. ",
        "Mr. Martin: In time, we'll all find out, Dr. Thornhart. ",
        "Woman: All finished. If you two will excuse us. ",
        "Mr. Martin: Well? ",
        "Woman: She's pretty convincing. They could be the real deal. ",
        "Mr. Martin: Not if you go by Thornhart's performance. ",
        "Woman: Bad, huh? ",
        "Mr. Martin: I didn't buy a word out of his mouth. ",
        "Ian: How'd it go? ",
        "Mr. Martin: We'd like to thank you both for cooperating. ",
        "Ian: Well, I would like to say I'm sorry that we're not going to see you \r\nagain. ",
        "Mr. Martin: You will. Marika and I will stop by periodically. ",
        "Marika: It could be anytime, day or night, without warning. ",
        "Mr. Martin: Have a nice day. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Eve, how could you ever think that I could hate you? Don't you know \r\nhow grateful I am to you for everything you've brought into my life at a time \r\nwhen I thought I'd never find any of those things again?",
        "Eve: I never thought I would ever find love at all. Especially not with \r\nsomeone as -- as honorable as you. ",
        "Kevin: We came into each other's life at a time when we needed to. ",
        "Eve: And now that time has ended. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I think it did. Look, if we were really meant to be together, \r\nnot Ian or Lucy would have been able to break us apart. ",
        "Eve: God, why do I feel like I've failed? Myself and us and the dreams that \r\nwe had together? ",
        "Kevin: You didn't. For a while, we made all our dreams come true. We built \r\nsomething wonderful. We built a road to the future. We hit a fork. That's all \r\nthere is to it. ",
        "Eve: Do you have any regrets? ",
        "Kevin: Not a single one. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: So what would you do if Kevin walked through that door right now and \r\nsaid he was sorry and that you guys belonged together forever? ",
        "Lucy: Um -- well, you know, I guess I'd just have to let him forgive me. ",
        "Livvie: So, if Jack walked through that door right now, maybe he should let \r\nme forgive him? ",
        "Lucy: Hmm, well -- ",
        "Livvie: Come on, what's the difference? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, there is a big, big -- no difference. ",
        "Livvie: You mean that? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I -- oh -- yes, I guess. You know, if you really think Jack is the \r\none worth fighting for, then maybe -- ok, maybe it wouldn't be so horrible if \r\nyou just talked to him, you know, tell him exactly how you feel and see how he \r\nfeels about that, you know. ",
        "Livvie: So -- so you really, really, really think I should? ",
        "Lucy: Look, I've learned now that honesty is definitely the best policy. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right. So maybe I should just \r\ngo -- I don't know -- find Jack and talk it out and see if there's anything \r\nthere worth saving. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I do. Exactly. That's it. Do it. ",
        "Livvie: Wait. There is only one problem. It's that Jack is already gone. ",
        "Lucy: Already gone where? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. He left Port Charles and he didn't tell me where he was \r\ngoing. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Well, you know, there's got to be somebody who knows where he is.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Jamal. ",
        "Lucy: Jamal. Call Jamal. ",
        "Livvie: Jamal. Oh! ",
        "Lucy: Ok, there's a phone down at the end of the hall. ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, thank you so much! You're the best. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, you're wet, you're wet. Your feet. Your toes. Don't -- listen up.\r\n",

        "Jack: Look, I need your help. Your office told me that you were -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no. Listen, listen to me. You have got to get out of here right \r\nnow, right now. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, I can't. You got to help me out. ",
        "Lucy: No, you have to go. ",
        "Jack: Look, Lucy, I know you don't owe me. You already stuck your neck out to \r\nhide what we did from Livvie about almost sleeping together. ",

        "Eve: We were going to spend the rest of our lives together. And now here we \r\nare. ",

        "Kevin: I promise to always honor our friendship and to be there for you in \r\ngood times and bad. ",
        "Eve: And I promise to be there for you in good times and in bad. Or if you \r\njust need a shoulder to cry on or a cup of hot chocolate. ",
