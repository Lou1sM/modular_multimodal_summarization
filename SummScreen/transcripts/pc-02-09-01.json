        "Ian: You want us to what -- share a bedroom? ",
        "Arianna: And bed, yes. ",
        "Ian: Oh -- ",
        "Arianna: We have to convince Immigration our marriage is real. ",
        "Ian: Um -- ",
        "Arianna: It has to look real. ",
        "Ian: You're right. You're right. Uh -- but know that I -- I of course will \r\nrespect your privacy and I would never take advantage -- ",
        "Arianna: I know. ",
        "Ian: And -- this is very upsetting. ",
        "Arianna: It's the INS agents. Their questions -- ",
        "Ian: No, no, no. No, it's -- well, partly, but we -- we made it fine through \r\nour first interview. ",
        "Arianna: Barely. You know, it's only going to get harder. ",
        "Ian: No, it won't because we will work on our answers together. ",
        "Arianna: Oh -- they'll see through us. Sooner or later, I know they'll see \r\nthrough us. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Arianna: It'll never look like we're in love. Why would anyone believe we're \r\nin love? ",
        "Ian: Hey, what are you doing? ",
        "Arianna: I'm leaving. ",
        "Ian: If you're leaving now, it's all over. ",
        "Arianna: It's over. Ben -- he's won. ",
        "",
        "Eve's Voice: You're married? Is it true? ",
        "Ian: Yes. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: It's true, we're married. ",

        "Lucy: Livvie -- ",
        "Jack: Look, Livvie, what you just heard -- ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that you two went to bed together? ",
        "Lucy: No! No, no -- that's not it. Jack was just explaining how embarrassed \r\nhe was. ",
        "Livvie: For sleeping with you. ",
        "Lucy: No! For falling asleep. He -- he fell asleep in my house when he came \r\nin uninvited. ",
        "Jack: Right. Right, exactly. ",
        "Lucy: Exactly. Remember that night that you found Jack in my house? It was \r\nbecause he had come there to wait for you and he'd fallen asleep. That's all \r\nthat happened -- ",
        "Livvie: That's enough, that's enough. ",
        "Jack: You got to -- ",
        "Livvie: No! Stop. Not another word. Not one. You both were acting strange \r\nthat night. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know me. I always act strange. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, him, too. The way you were looking at each other and the way \r\nit felt in that room. I never even told you about Lucy having a new place, and \r\nyou were there, and -- and you were hiding from me. And you were arguing with \r\nKevin, and your clothes were all messed up, and -- ",
        "Lucy: I can explain that -- ",
        "Livvie: No! That's what you said that night -- you tried -- one excuse after \r\nanother, but none of them made any sense because -- oh, my God. ",
        "Jack: Look, let's just all -- ",
        "Lucy: Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: I can't believe this. I cannot believe how stupid I was \r\nnot to see it. You two really slept together, didn't you? Didn't you? ",
        "Lucy: Livvie -- please -- ",
        "Jack: Livvie, let us explain, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Explain what? What happened didn't happen? ",
        "Lucy: Well, you -- ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no, don't you dare. Nothing else makes any sense. You had sex \r\nwith her? ",
        "Jack: No, no, we didn't. We never even came close to having sex. ",
        "Lucy: No, no, Jack and I only -- ",
        "Livvie: Only what? Kissed? Undressed? Touched? What? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, yes. That, but you have to understand. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, I understand. ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute! Come on, I didn't know Jack -- was Jack, you know? I \r\ndidn't know -- now I know, but I didn't know it was him. ",
        "Jack: That's true. When I found out the two of you knew each other, it \r\ntotally flipped me out. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, and that's supposed to make it ok? Like it's some kind of excuse \r\nor something? ",
        "Jack: No, no, not an excuse, all right? An explanation. And, no, it's not ok. \r\nOk, I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I would take it back if I could. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you can't. ",
        "Lucy: We both know we made a big mistake. We both know what we did that night \r\nwas wrong. But you have to understand because we were at rock bottom. I mean, \r\nyou had just left Jack, you dumped him, and Kevin had just walked completely \r\naway from me. ",
        "Livvie: And I'm supposed to, what, feel sorry for you and how hurt you were?\r\n",
        "Lucy: We really were hurt and sometimes things just happen. ",
        "Livvie: And it was just going to happen again. ",
        "Jack: No, no, it wasn't. ",
        "Livvie: No? Then what are you doing here? ",
        "Jack: I came to tell Lucy that I told the cops I was working for her, so \r\nmaybe she could cover for me. ",
        "Livvie: Oh -- ",
        "Lucy: You did? ",
        "Livvie: God, how stupid do you think I am? Ten minutes ago you were \r\nall upset about the idea of me having sex with Jack. Well, what was that all \r\nabout, huh? You trying to save him for yourself? ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, listen to me, please. ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Lucy: You have to listen. ",
        "Livvie: I am not listening to any more lies. All this time you pretended to \r\nbe my friend, even somewhat of a substitute mom. ",
        "Lucy: I was not pretending -- ",
        "Livvie: Well, guess what, Mom -- I never even want to see you again!\r\n",
        "Jack: Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: Or you! ",
        "",
        "Ian: After everything your brother's done, then, I'm a little surprised you \r\ncarry a picture around of the two of you. ",
        "Arianna: Memories are all I have left of better times, when I had a home, a \r\nfamily. The people I loved didn't want me dead. ",
        "Ian: You have a home now. Trust that. It'll all be all right. And when those \r\nINS agents come back, we'll convince them that we do have a real marriage going \r\nhere and then -- well, then you can start your life over. ",
        "Arianna: I suppose playing the part of a man in love won't be too hard. All \r\nyou have to do is think of Eve. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: No. I should be thinking of you right now. And I know I didn't do a \r\ngreat job with those INS people, but I'll work on it. I'll learn everything \r\nabout you. I'll make a study of it. And when they come back, I promise you, \r\nwe'll convince them that we're husband and wife. ",
        "Arianna: But you keep saying that. How? ",
        "Ian: How. Well, all right. First, we'll make sure that they believe that we \r\ndo share the same bed. And then we'll show them that we're starting to build a \r\nlife together. We'll -- we'll go shopping. We'll buy things, girlie things -- \r\nflowers and pictures of flowers or pillows with flowers, something. And then -- \r\nthen I guess I'll have to get a job to pay for everything. Ok. I'm going back to \r\nthe hospital, see if I can get my old job back. ",
        "Arianna: Uh -- wait. ",
        "Ian: What's the problem? ",
        "Arianna: No, nothing. I'm fine. ",
        "Ian: You're afraid to be alone, aren't you? ",
        "Arianna: What if Ben -- ",
        "Ian: Your brother's behind bars and that's where he's going to stay. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Excuse me. Can I help you? ",
        "Ben: Sorry? ",
        "Chris: Can I help you? This is doctors only. ",
        "Ben: Oh. My apologies. Forgive me. ",
        "Chris: Hey, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Ramsey. You finally decided to do a little work for a change? ",
        "Chris: Surprised to see you here. Why are you back so soon? What's up? ",
        "Eve: What do you mean? ",
        "Chris: Well, I mean, it's late. I'm surprised you're not home. What happened \r\nto you? Hubby kick you out of bed? Eve? ",
        "Eve: Can I just do a little bit of research here, Ramsey, please? ",
        "Chris: Hey, what's going on? ",
        "Eve: The sight of you brings tears to my eyes, Mr. Chief Resident, sir. \r\nKevin and I decided not to renew our wedding vows. ",
        "Chris: I see. What does that mean? ",
        "Eve: That means that I would just like to get back to work and get on with my \r\nlife, ok? ",
        "Chris: Without Kevin? ",
        "Eve: Well, I guess it's only a matter of time before everyone finds out. \r\nKevin and I are splitting up. ",
        "Chris: Oh. Well, for what it's worth, I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: Thanks. ",
        "Chris: But, hey, it was always me who told you the guy was never good enough \r\nfor you. ",
        "Eve: What? What the hell are you saying? ",
        "Chris: Nothing. It's just -- where's that coming from? ",
        "Eve: It's coming from you not respecting Kevin. In all of my life I have \r\nnever known another love like Kevin's. ",
        "Chris: Well, then why are you breaking up with him? ",
        "Ian: Lambert? ",
        "",
        "Jack: Livvie, don't blame Lucy for what happened between us, all right? It's \r\nnot her fault. I talked her into the whole thing. ",
        "Livvie: Ten points for taking the blame all by yourself. ",
        "Lucy: Now, wait a minute. We both -- we both were very stupid that night. ",
        "Livvie: And now you're wasting your time because I am through being the \r\ninnocent little idiot of Port Charles. You're not my friend and you never have \r\nbeen. And, you, I had real feelings for you. ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: I believed in them and I even believed in you enough to try and push \r\nyou and my father to -- oh, God. Kevin. He knows all about this, doesn't he? ",
        "Jack: Come on, Livvie, let's just sit down and we'll talk -- ",
        "Livvie: That is just great! That's just perfect. That ties it up all nice and \r\nneat. Everybody I ever cared about. Well, thanks a lot for the lesson, guys. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, Livvie, don't leave. You can't just leave like that. ",
        "Livvie: Watch me. ",
        "Lucy: No, please. Listen, you're very upset and it's not safe for you to go \r\nout there. Just stay a minute. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, no, no, you are wrong. I am not upset at all. Growing up is never \r\neasy, but it has to happen. ",
        "Jack: Come on, Livvie, don't do this, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, Jack, you're the one who did it, not me. But I'll be \r\nfine. Like anybody who lives through a disaster, you pick yourself up and you \r\nsurvive, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, come on. ",
        "Livvie: In fact, I am feeling better than I have in a long, long time, and \r\nyou know why? Because I finally know what I want now. I know exactly where I \r\nwant to go and exactly what I want to do, and I have never been more sure of \r\nanything in my entire life. Ta! ",

        "Arianna: Ben. ",
        "Ben: I waited to give us this time alone. ",
        "Arianna: I don't understand. ",
        "Ben: How I got out of jail? The right word in just the right ear. Nothing's \r\nimpossible when it comes to our uncle back home pulling the right strings. ",
        "Arianna: I see. ",
        "Ben: The number of strings was extensive, but now you won't be left alone in \r\nthis country. ",
        "Arianna: What do you mean? ",
        "Ben: I'm staying to make sure that you find your happiness and you settle in.\r\n",
        "Arianna: No. ",
        "Ben: It's the family wish. There is no use in fighting their will. There's no \r\nlonger any need to fear. It's a gesture of my good will. ",
        "Arianna: If you want to make a gesture, Ben, why don't you just leave? ",
        "Ben: I accept and understand things as they are. Here. Let's put these last \r\nfew weeks behind us in honor of you and your marriage. Open it, please. I \r\ninsist. ",

        "Eve: Ian, what are you doing here? ",
        "Ian: I was at the hospital, and I -- can I talk to you? ",
        "Chris: I guess I don't have to ask why you and Kevin are giving up now. ",
        "Ian: What? What did you say? ",
        "Chris: What -- what's the problem? What, you said everyone was going to find \r\nout sooner or later anyway. ",
        "Ian: Eve, what happened? ",
        "Chris: Hey, you know, I'd love to stay, but I'm tired, I'm off duty. Now I'm \r\ngoing home. No need to thank me for the privacy. ",
        "Ian: You and Kevin are splitting up? I mean, what -- I had heard about the \r\nvows, but what -- ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I guess everybody's talking, huh? ",
        "Ian: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Eve: Well, we've both been so busy, you know, lately. Everything that's been \r\ngoing on in our lives -- hey, speaking of which, how's the new bride? Are you \r\nlooking forward to your honeymoon? ",
        "Ian: She's -- she's fine. ",
        "Eve: Good, good. And you? Are you enjoying the company? ",
        "Ian: Am I -- yeah, I -- I want to hear about you and Kevin. ",
        "Eve: Oh, well, there's not much to tell. You know, it's over. We were having \r\nproblems before the kidnapping. You know that. ",
        "Ian: Yes, I know. ",
        "Eve: So -- well, and then being apart for so long didn't help, but we're -- \r\nyou know, we both want the same thing and we're friends, so that's important. \r\nOnward and upward, right? You know, today is the first day of the rest of my \r\nlife. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. Right, yeah. I don't buy it. ",
        "Eve: Well, I don't write the songs that make the whole world sing. I just \r\nquote them. ",
        "Ian: Don't be flippant with me. Tell me what else is going on here. ",
        "Eve: What do you mean, what else? I don't owe you an explanation, Ian. You've \r\ngot your life to live, so why don't you go live it? You know, you're a newlywed. \r\nCongratulations. ",
        "[Eve sighs] ",
        "Eve: You just concentrate on your own happy marriage and stay out of mine. I \r\nam just your colleague. ",

        "Jack: Oh, boy. Well, guess there's no use in running after her. ",
        "Lucy: No. That would be sort of pointless, considering, I think, right now \r\nshe hates us both. ",
        "Jack: And after everything I did to try to keep her from getting hurt. I \r\nmean, trying to leave town, pushing her away. And believe me, I pushed hard. \r\nBut, guess at the end, I'm the one who hurt her the most. ",
        "Lucy: You really, really do care about her, don't you? ",
        "Jack: Lucy, I love her. Oh, man. ",
        "Lucy: What? What's the matter? ",

        "Jack: Don't you think it's a little too late for that? ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not. It's just, you got to give me a minute, some time, and \r\nI'll come up with a plan. I'll get an idea. I promise, I promise. ",
        "Jack: Well, ok, but, I mean, that's the last thing I can think about. I mean, \r\nyou saw her face, right? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I did. She was trying to be very brave, but inside -- ",
        "Jack: Something else was going on -- and the sound in her voice when she \r\ntalked about knowing what she had to do. ",
