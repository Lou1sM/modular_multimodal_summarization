        "Amy: Why'd I lie? I have a good explanation. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'd like to hear it. ",
        "Amy: I lied because I want to spend time with you, Ian. Alone. ",
        "Ian: I -- I don't know what to say. ",
        "Amy: Then don't say anything. Just listen, ok? I mean, please, Ian, you know \r\nhow I am. I -- I don't hold anything back. I just let it all out. ",
        "Ian: Why would you tell me this now? ",
        "Amy: Because I've got nothing to lose. I'm going to be leaving town soon. ",
        "Ian: You're leaving Port Charles? ",
        "Amy: Mm-hmm. A new job. I got a wonderful offer, and I took it. ",
        "Ian: I see. ",
        "Amy: My dream job. So -- ",
        "Ian: So, when are you leaving? ",
        "Amy: Six weeks or so. I'll miss you if you promise to miss me. Hello? ",
        "Ian: I'm still here. ",
        "Amy: You're staring at me again, aren't you? I guess I should've just kept my \r\nbig mouth shut. But if I let things be, if I -- if I left town and didn't tell \r\nyou how I felt -- ",
        "Ian: It's not your style, is it? ",
        "Amy: No, it's not. Forgive me for putting you on the spot. ",
        "Ian: Well, I think you're the one that's on the spot now. ",
        "Amy: Kind of turned the tables, haven't you? ",
        "Ian: What do you want? ",
        "Amy: I want to have a passionate, grand affair with you, Ian. ",

        "Kevin: Don't lie to me, Paige. You were there. You were in the tunnel, with a \r\nlight. But how? How? ",
        "Paige: Kevin -- ",
        "Kevin: It happened! ",
        "Paige: Please, try and relax! ",
        "Kevin: I saw you there, and you know it. ",
        "Paige: In a dream -- ",
        "Kevin: No, in that dress. And it wasn't a dream. ",
        "Paige: For heaven's sake, Kevin, you were unconscious. You were in a coma.\r\n",
        "Kevin: And I saw the tunnel. I saw the tunnel that so many people describe. \r\nWith a light. The light at the end of it. And you were wearing that dress, Paige \r\n-- that dress that I know I have never seen before. ",
        "Paige: Kevin, I'm sure I must've worn this dress at least once since I've \r\nbeen here. ",
        "Kevin: But I've never seen it until you came to me. ",
        "Paige: Look, I didn't come to you. It was a dream. Now, please, try and \r\nrelax. ",
        "Kevin: Something happened to me! Something happened between you and me. Paige \r\n-- ",
        "Colleen: Doctor, settle down. ",
        "Kevin: Hello, Colleen. ",
        "Colleen: Look, I was afraid that that headache was going to keep you awake.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No, no. No sleeping pills. ",
        "Colleen: It's just aspirin. Take it. ",
        "Kevin: Have you met Sgt. Colleen? ",
        "Colleen: It's nice to meet you. Ok, if you can just relax, I'm going to get \r\nyour stats. You know, there's nothing worse than a patient with a first name of \r\ndoctor. Blood pressure's perfect, 122/68. Pulse is nice and regular at 72. Let \r\nme just fluff this up for you. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. You hear that, Paige? All my readings are normal. ",
        "Paige: That's good news. ",
        "Colleen: You need anything else right now? ",
        "Kevin: No. Not a thing. ",
        "Colleen: I'll check on you later. ",
        "Kevin: Thanks. ",

        "[Door opens and closes] ",
        "Kevin: Well? ",
        "Paige: Well, yes, I heard. Everything is fine, but you weren't fine 24 hours \r\nago. You had some kind of hallucination. ",
        "Kevin: It wasn't a hallucination. And it wasn't a dream, either. I know what \r\na dream is. I know what a dream feels like. ",
        "Paige: Let's say it wasn't a dream and it wasn't the drugs, but you don't \r\nknow what it was. Neither do I. But what I do know is that it wasn't real. Just \r\nthink about it. ",
        "Kevin: I have. Here's what I don't get. ",
        "Paige: What? ",
        "Kevin: Every story I've heard, every case I've studied, people that describe \r\nthe tunnel with the light say that the people they find inside the tunnel are \r\npeople that they've known before, people that they loved when they were still \r\nalive. ",
        "Paige: Kevin -- ",
        "Kevin: And the people that turn up in the tunnel who were supposed to help \r\nyou get to the other side are already dead. ",

        "Alison: Shh. Shh. ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "Alison: I fought my feelings for you for such a long time. But every time I \r\nwould see you, I would just melt. ",
        "Rafe: You should've heard the arguments I had with myself. I said, \"Rafe, you \r\ncan't do this. You're an angel. You're supposed to be helping her.\" But the \r\nfeelings that I had were just so powerful and -- and I can't remember a time \r\nthat I wasn't loving you or wanting you. ",

        "Ian: You got what? I didn't say anything. ",
        "Amy: You didn't have to. I know from the sound of your voice. You want to \r\nknow what I heard on the tip of that very desirable tongue of yours, doctor? Bet \r\nyou five bucks I'm right. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Amy: You're sorry. You're flattered. ",
        "Ian: No, I said \"flattered.\" ",

        "Ian: That's true. ",
        "Amy: But as a friend. And only a friend. I mean, that was the speech you were \r\nplanning to give me, right? ",
        "Ian: You owe me five bucks. ",

        "Rafe: Why? What? ",
        "Alison: Confused on why it took so long. I mean, I thought when I read your \r\njournal and I realized how you felt, I mean, I couldn't really allow myself to \r\nfeel it. And I couldn't show how excited I was. And plus, knowing what it meant, \r\nthat you felt the same way about me. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, come on. You knew how I felt a lot longer before you read the \r\njournal. I mean, I wasn't that good at hiding it. You know that. Not at all. \r\nEvery part of me didn't want to hide it. ",
