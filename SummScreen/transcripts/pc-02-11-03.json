        "Jack assures Tess that he's not angry with her for changing her mind about leaving town. While he and Tess enjoy a lazy morning at home, the others meet at Ian's loft to strategize. Alison and Rafe both believe that Tess is the key, but their goals are very different. Rafe wants to use Tess to make Caleb vulnerable enough to be killed, but Alison believes that Tess can heal him and make him a good person. The others give them some privacy to argue, and Lucy shocks Ian by speculating about how having sex with a slayer might affect Caleb. Despite Rafe's assurances, Alison is afraid that Tess will get hurt by his plan. She visits Tess and expresses confidence in her friend's ability to help \"Stephen.\" When Elizabeth struggles to understand how Joshua can be standing in the same room with her after she killed him, he answers her question by revealing a brand new set of fangs. He's grateful to her for doing what Caleb was never willing to do. Now he wants to take Caleb down, and he wants Elizabeth's help. She refuses until Joshua convinces her that her husband has had many affairs in the short time they've been married. Meanwhile, when Reese complains to Caleb about his behavior, he assures her that he knows exactly what he's doing. The Stephen Clay Experience plays \"Newborn Heart\" in its entirety as they make a live recording. Afterward, Caleb listens to the track and fantasizes that Livvie comes back to him."

        "Rafe: So it was a close call last night.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it was a very, very close call.",
        "Jamal: So, what do we do? How do you propose we get Caleb this time?",
        "Ian: I'm working on a formula that's going to reverse the vampire virus, but it's still a long shot.",
        "Lucy: Right, and we also have to keep in mind that when we were able to get to Caleb last time -- even if it was just temporarily -- we got him when he was very vulnerable.",
        "Ian: Using Michael and Livvie.",
        "Lucy: Right.",
        "Rafe: Following that reasoning, we're going to have to use Tess to get to Caleb.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. He's obsessed with her. We're going to have to use her as bait. We'll use her to get him to let his guard down.",
        "Alison: No, no, we can't do that.",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. No, Jack's not going to go for that.",
        "Rafe: Well, you know what? We're going to have to convince him.",
        "Lucy: Cousin, that is going to take a lot of convincing.",
        "Rafe: I don't like this any more than you guys, but right now it's the best and pretty much the only solution there is.",
        "Alison: Unless --",
        "Ian: Unless what?",
        "Alison: What if we just let Tess keep doing what she's doing?",
        "Lucy: And what are you talking about?",
        "Alison: Well, she's a healer, right? I mean, we've all seen that. And her and Caleb -- they obviously share a very strong bond. So what if we just left her alone for a little bit? Who's to say that maybe she couldn't reach the good in Caleb? You never know. I mean, Tess might be able to change Caleb's heart forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: So, all -- all those images that I was seeing -- it was really you?",
        "Joshua: Or not.",
        "Elizabeth: No, I don't I don't understand.",
        "[Elizabeth gasps]",
        "Elizabeth: You are real.",
        "Joshua: Let's just say I'm resilient.",
        "Elizabeth: And now what? Now you're going to kill me? Is that it? Well, you know what? You go right ahead because I don't have anything to lose. What are you going to do? You going to strangle me? You going to shoot me?",
        "Joshua: Oh, please, don't be so melodramatic. You're so tedious, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: You're not going to kill me? Well, then, if you're not going to kill -- what? What?",
        "Joshua: Well, that really depends on you.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, I get it. Stephen put you up to this, didn't he? Yeah, he's trying to get back at me.",
        "Joshua: Oh, don't flatter yourself.",
        "Elizabeth: We are still married.",
        "Joshua: Oh, yes, I'm sure it must be obvious, even to you, that he's totally obsessed right now with this long-lost little love Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Morning.",
        "Jack: Hey. Good morning.",
        "Tess: You're not mad at me, are you, about changing my mind?",
        "Jack: No. Tess, I am not mad at you. Look, this is your home, and if you don't want to leave Port Charles, then I'm not going to push you away.",
        "Tess: I know you're worried about Stephen and about this connection or whatever it is I have to him, especially after last night.",
        "Jack: You were able to stop him last night, and that was an incredible thing.",
        "Tess: You really think so?",
        "Jack: Yes, I do. Because if you wouldn't have, then he would've released the vampires and a lot of people would've gotten hurt.",
        "Tess: Then why do you look so worried still? What's wrong?",
        "Jack: I'm not -- I'm not worried. I'm -- I'm with my wife, who I love more than anything. And I don't want to talk about Stephen or Caleb. I just want to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caz: You know, I still can't believe Stephen called off the feeding last night. He knows how long we've been waiting.",
        "Reese: And I can't believe he let some stupid girl talk him out of it.",
        "Caz: Hmm. Yeahwell, he calls the shots.",
        "Ricky: Hey, Marissa, what's up?",
        "Casey: Hey, Ricky, what's up? Ahem. I mean, where's Stephen? What's this all about?",
        "Ricky: I don't know. All I know is that at this hour, it better be good.",
        "Caleb: Hey. I'm glad we could all drag our asses out of bed to be here.",
        "Ricky: So, what's going on, man?",
        "Caleb: What's going on is today we record the new song.",
        "Reese: You mean \"Newborn Heart,\" that sappy one about some girl?",
        "Cab: Not just any girl. An amazing one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Caleb doesn't have a heart for Tess to heal, Alison.",
        "Alison: Do you know that for a fact?",
        "Rafe: I know Caleb better than anyone here. It's not a long shot. It's a no shot.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, I can't are with that. Caleb was ready to sick his whole posse on the town.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but he didn't because of her. You see?",
        "Ian: Tess is a very special girl with very special powers, but this could just be a game that Caleb's playing.",
        "Rafe: That's right. Everything with him is a game.",
        "Alison: No, not this.",
        "Rafe: Ok, look, I know you want this to be the answer -- not just for Tess' sake but for your mother. I know that. But the thing is, I'm trying to tell you --",
        "Alison: Look, Caleb loved Livvie, which made him vulnerable. Tess is the purest, most innocent form of Livvie.",
        "Lucy: Alison does have a point there, you know.",
        "Rafe: You think? I mean, what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to just stand around and do nothing? Caleb -- he almost unleashed holy hell on this whole town last night.",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok, you're right. Rafe -- Rafe has a point, too.",
        "Rafe: Thank you.",
        "Alison: Ok, what about my mother?",
        "Rarafe: Your mother -- she's already proven she can't be trusted. She bit Ian, for God's sakes. And we already know that she's capable of a lot more, ok? So all I'm trying to say is they're dangerous. They need to be stopped now. And Tess is the key -- but not to heal him. To get him up for the kill.",
        "Alison: Rafe, you of all people should believe in miracles. Where is your faith?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: This is funny.",
        "Jack: What's so funny?",
        "Tess: Charlie brown keeps trying to kick the ball, and Snoopy's taking it away. That's funny.",
        "Jack: He gets him every time, doesn't he?",
        "Tess: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: Just like you get to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Stephen, can I talk to you for a sec?",
        "Caleb: Not really a good time, Reese.",
        "Reese: I know. It's just that I'm a bit worried about you.",
        "Caleb: Why are you worried about me?",
        "Reese: It just seems that lately you're sort of out of it, you know? Not you.",
        "Caleb: No, I don't know.",
        "Reese: It's just that things are different. We don't even rehearse as much as we used to anymore. And then there was last night in the woods.",
        "Caleb: When I called off the feeding.",
        "Reese: Yeah, what was that about? And then you come in this morning and announce that we're going to record this song which is so not our style for some girl. You seem unfocused. But maybe this is because Josh is gone. I know what a big help he was to you. I know how much you counted on him. So what I'm trying to say is, if you need someone to fill in or whatever, I totally don't have a problem with that. Really.",
        "Caleb: That's nice. I'm doing just fine without Joshua, but thanks for the offer. Everything's right on track.",
        "Reese: Oh, so this is part of some bigger plan? Is that what you're trying to say?",
        "Caleb: Reese, I don't do anything without knowing exactly what I'm going to get in return.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: You know, you guys, I'm going to -- I'm going to get out of here, all right?",
        "Alison: No, Jamal, you don't have to leave.",
        "Jamal: No, no, that's cool, baby. Don't worry about it.",
        "Lucy: And I need to walk you out and tell you something. We need to walk him out and tell him something.",
        "Ian: Oh, sure.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Alison: Ahem.",
        "Rafe: You know what? This isn't about faith. This is about reality. This is about what I know versus what you're hoping for. Please don't tell me that you're concerned about this monster.",
        "Alison: No, I am not concerned about the -- I'm worried about Tess. If Caleb ever found out -- even suspected what she was up to -- she would be in real danger.",
        "Rafe: Ok, well, I won't let that happen, ok?",
        "Alison: Still, that doesn't make it right -- not when there's another way where no one will get hurt.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Alison: Please, I'm sorry. Will you just try and understand what I'm saying just for one second?",
        "Lucy: Do you see what's happening? Caleb is getting exactly what he wants. He wants to turn all of us against each other.",
        "Ian: That's not going to happen. We'll think of something.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, I -- I -- I think I sort of maybe already did.",
        "Ian: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Lucy: You know what? No, it's --",
        "Ian: Lucy, you already started. What's --",
        "lucy: No, I didn't -- it's nothing. I don't think you'd like it at all.",
        "Ian: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Ok. You know how we sort of figured out something that helps you -- I mean, suppresses your urges -- is when we, you know, then -- you know, but -- but no one else knows that but us.",
        "Ian: When we make love, you mean?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that. But wait. Obviously it has some affect on a vampire. I mean, it suppresses the urges if a vampire sleeps with a slayer, maybe changes him somehow.",
        "Ian: What are you saying to me? You want to sleep with Caleb?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I want to try a live recording first, everybody playing together. You got it?",
        "Ricky: Let's go, man.",
        "Casey: Man, I had no idea you had all this talent. At least in the music department, anyway.",
        "Ricky: What are you talking about? You've only seen me play these a hundred times.",
        "Casey: Yeah, of course I have. I'm just saying I still -- I still can't get over it is all.",
        "Caleb: All set?",
        "Caz: Let's do it.",
        "Caleb: All right. Let's let it all loose, all right? I want to blow some minds with this track, literally.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: What do you want? I mean, because it is obvious that you want something. What? Oh, God, no. I will never, ever go to bed with you.",
        "Joshua: How devastating.",
        "Elizabeth: Don't be so smug. You know, just -- wait -- when I tell Stephen --",
        "Joshua: Could you please just let five minutes go by without mentioning his name?",
        "Elizabeth: I've never heard you speak about Stephen using that tone of voice before.",
        "Joshua: Well, perhaps times are changing.",
        "Elizabeth: What, you're tired of being his little servant?",
        "Joshua: You still don't get it, do you?",
        "Elizabeth: I don't know why I was so afraid of you in the first place.",
        "Joshua: You saw me dead. Now you see me alive.",
        "Elizabeth: Or maybe you're just still one of my nightmares.",
        "Joshua: Wrong again, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, God --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: No, I do not want to sleep with Caleb. I can't believe you even brought that up. Why would you say that? I was just -- I was talking, like, the big picture thing, an observation --",
        "Ian: I understand the big picture. You brought it up, not me.",
        "Lucy: But don't you even wonder? I mean, what would it be? What would happen if Caleb actually slept with a slayer?",
        "Ian: No, I don't wonder, and you shouldn't, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I'm a slayer. This is what I do. I after evil and destroy it. And I'm telling you, this is the only way to deal with Caleb.",
        "Alison: And I'm telling you, Rafe, that the world is not as black and white as you see it. I love you very much and I'm usually right along with your instincts, but in this case I think that you're wrong. Ok?",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "Lucy: Oh, bye.",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "Lucy: I'll call you later.",
        "Alison: Ok, see you later.",
        "Lucy: Ok. So things obviously didn't go so great with Alison.",
        "Rafe: Not so much. I tried to tell her that I'd make sure Tess wouldn't get hurt, and she didn't believe me, really. I don't know. I thought she trusted me, but --",
        "Lucy: She does. She really does trust you. I know deep down in her heart, she knows you can handle this whole big picture. You know, she knows you'll be ok with Tess and Caleb and her mother. She does, Rafe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: So when I bit you, I didn't kill you. I did this. I turned you into a vampire.",
        "Joshua: Gratefully so.",
        "Elizabeth: You're grateful?",
        "Joshua: Yes. This is what I always wanted, except Stephen would never allow it.",
        "Elizabeth: So now that you are a vampire, thanks to me, what do you want?",
        "Joshua: I want what every male of the species wants.",
        "Elizabeth: Money. Power. That's it, isn't it? You want to be more powerful than Stephen.",
        "Joshua: You asked what I wanted from you.",
        "Elizabeth: No, no. If it has anything to do with bringing down Stephen, no, I won't have anything to do with that.",
        "Joshua: Surely you don't still feel obliged to him, not now that you know how he feels about you -- or doesn't feel about you.",
        "Elizabeth: I just -- I just don't want to get on his bad side -- his worst side.",
        "Joshua: Even after he's made such a fool of you?",
        "Elizabeth: So he's found someone he thinks he's in love with. Big deal.",
        "Joshua: Come on, there's more than that. What about the hostess at Celini's? Did you see them both laughing at you behind your back? And then there's that other one -- what is her name? That pretty doctor -- Karen over at the hospital. What about her?",
        "Elizabeth: No, you're lying. You're lying. I don't believe you.",
        "Joshua: Pass me the phone. I'll call her. She'll tell you.",
        "Elizabeth: How many were there?",
        "Joshua: I don't really think you could handle the details. Not right now. It would be kind of like living your first marriage all over again.",
        "Elizabeth: Tell me what you need me to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: One, two, three, four.",
        "Caleb: I don't have the strength to lie anymore, spend my life taking all the wrong doors, think I have the answers, questions remain still, here on the outside covered in pain, so magnify the light that shines through my window,",
        "band: I can see so clearly in your eyes",
