        "Frank: Whoa. ",
        "Alison: Enough lights? ",
        "Frank: I'd say we're visible from Mars. My electric bill's going to go \r\nthrough the roof. ",
        "Alison: Oh, I know. Tell me about it. Everything costs a bundle. I'm just \r\nadding up the figures that I have for that little surprise that I planned. ",
        "Frank: For Jamal? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's amazing to me how these little zeros just keep growing and \r\ngrowing. I'm actually a couple thousand short. I even thought about asking Nana \r\nfor a loan. ",
        "Frank: Temporary insanity? ",
        "Alison: Uh, yeah. And that passed -- quickly. But I do need to get my hands \r\non some cold hard cash. ",
        "",
        "Travis: What about your girlfriend? Got Valentine's Day coming up. You might \r\nwant some extra money to buy her some bling-bling, you know? Show her what a \r\nplayer you are? ",
        "Jamal: She don't care about diamonds and bracelets and stuff like that. ",
        "Travis: Come on, man, that's all chicks care about. Look, Jamal, this is easy \r\nbank. And the best part, nobody has to know. Or you can just keep living off \r\nthat sweet girlfriend of yours. I mean, hell, that's a good racket, too. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hey, what's up, Jamal? Have you seen Livvie around? ",
        "Jamal: No. No. What's up? ",
        "Jack: Damn. Damn. Let's put it this way -- if Livvie screws up her life, it's \r\nmy fault. ",
        "",
        "Chris: You mind telling me why you're naked in my bed? ",
        "Livvie: I'm waiting for you. ",
        "Chris: You know, the last time that you tried to seduce me, you were trying \r\nto get me to admit that I had Jack arrested. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, if you think I'm wired, you can come and frisk me. ",
        "Chris: Sure. Sure, you know, just one question. If this isn't a scam, why \r\nexactly are you here? ",
        "Livvie: Easy. I want you to make love to me. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: How can you talk to me about having another baby when you know I \r\njust had a miscarriage? ",
        "Ben: Life goes on. ",
        "Arianna: Even if I wanted to, it's not safe for me to have another baby so \r\nsoon. ",
        "Ben: Who put that ridiculous notion in your head? Dr. Lambert? In our \r\ncountry, see, no woman would be permitted to think that way. ",
        "Arianna: Eve had nothing to do with this. ",
        "Ben: You know, first she has me put in jail, and now she's infecting you with \r\nher thinking. ",
        "Arianna: Look, let's forget about Dr. Lambert. Why are you here? ",
        "Ben: Let me make it clear that the only way for you to redeem yourself with \r\nthe family is by giving them a legitimate grandchild. If you don't... ",
        "",
        "Eve: I remembered. Everything. I remember Christmas Eve, I remember that we \r\ndanced, and I remember the exact moment that you gave me your bracelet. And I \r\nremember that you sacrificed your life so that I could go free. ",
        "Ian: But then you came back wearing a pilot's jumpsuit. Do you remember that?\r\n",
        "Eve: Right, right, right. I thought you'd be happier to see me. ",
        "Ian: You have no idea how happy I was. ",
        "Eve: But we couldn't show it. You couldn't show it until we got to the cabin.\r\n",
        "Ian: You remember the cabin? ",
        "Eve: Yes. I remember how much I wanted you, and I remember how you held me in \r\nyour arms. ",
        "Ian: And what? What else? ",
        "Eve: And I remember that you told me that you loved me, and I said I love \r\nyou, too. ",
        "Ian: They told me the day after the accident that you might never remember. \r\nBut I prayed day after day that you would. ",
        "Eve: I didn't. ",
        "Ian: But now you do. Is that why you've left Kevin? ",
        "Eve: I told him that I fell in love with you. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: So what's up with you and Livvie, man? ",
        "Alison: There is my movie star boyfriend. ",
        "Jamal: I'm no Denzel, just a gofer on the set. But the movie's wrapped \r\nanyway. ",
        "Alison: Oh, well, good. Then that will give us more time to spend together. \r\nJamal, that job was so beneath you. Trust me, you will find something much \r\nbetter. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, Ali, get real. I'm not what you call a guy with \r\nprospects. ",
        "Jack: Ok, sorry to interrupt Career Day here, guys, but, Alison, I really got \r\nto talk to you. ",
        "Alison: About what? ",
        "Jack: Livvie. Have you heard from her? ",
        "Alison: No, and I'm not really sure that I would tell you if I did. ",
        "Jack: I just want to make sure that she's all right. ",
        "Jamal: Is she in some kind of trouble? ",
        "Alison: No, not since she stopped dating him. ",
        "Jack: Ok, just help me find her, and you can go back to hating me. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, give the guy a break, all right? ",
        "Alison: Oh -- ok. She mentioned stopping by the hospital to see her grandma. \r\nI will make one phone call. One. ",
        "Jack: Thanks. Thank you. ",
        "Jamal: So what's up? What did you do? Did you forget her birthday or \r\nsomething? Wreck her car? Get caught fooling around? You been kicking with \r\nsomeone else, huh? ",
        "Jack: No, not just someone. Someone Livvie knows well. Lucy Coe. ",
        "",
        "Chris: What happened, Livvie? Jack busy tonight? ",
        "Livvie: Maybe I've finally come to really appreciate you, Chris. You are the \r\none person who hasn't let me down, ok? You tried to warn me about Kevin and Lucy \r\nand Jack, but I trusted them anyway, and it was a mistake. ",
        "Chris: Something happened with Jack tonight, didn't it? Hey, I warned you.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah. You warned me. I get it now, ok, Chris? I get it. And I am \r\nthrough with that loser, so come on. Come on, let's just concentrate on us now.\r\n",
        "Chris: Let me guess. You and Jack had a fight, and now you're here trying to \r\nuse me to get back at him. ",
        "Livvie: What if I am? ",
        "Livvie: Are you going to kick me out of your bed, or are you going to make \r\nlove to me? Pick one, Chris. ",
        "",
        "Ian: You're finally free. ",
        "Eve: You're not. ",
        "Ian: If you knew how long I hoped for you to remember so you can be with me, \r\nlove me. But I thought -- ",
        "Eve: What? You thought what? ",
        "Ian: I thought I'd lost you forever. And all I wanted was to grab you, hold \r\nyou, and kiss you, and remind you that you need to be with me, that this is our \r\ntime. ",
        "Eve: Why didn't you? ",
        "Ian: Because the doctors told me that I shouldn't force your memory. It'd be \r\ntoo traumatic. All I wanted was for you to remember on your own and look at me \r\nthe way you did in the cabin. ",
        "Eve: And when I didn't, you turned to somebody else for comfort. ",
        "Ian: No, no, no, I -- Arianna and I are -- ",
        "Eve: Look, look. I don't know what this is with you and Arianna. I don't know \r\nif you married her because you love her or if you married her because you want \r\nto keep her safe from her brother. ",
        "Ian: Eve, Eve. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Listen to me. ",
        "Eve: No, because what we've shared together -- Ian, please, tell me you still \r\nfeel that. ",
        "Ian: It's not that simple. ",
        "Eve: Yes, it is. I know how you feel about me, and I know you can't possibly \r\nfeel that way about anyone else. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me in the eyes. \r\nI'm looking at you the same way I looked at you in the cabin. Please tell me you \r\nstill love me the same way. Ian -- ",
        "Arianna: Ian, there -- you are. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: If you think Livvie's going to cut you some slack after you jumped \r\nLucy's bones, you are crazy. ",
        "Jack: Well, we didn't actually sleep together. Livvie's father walked in and \r\nsort of interrupted. ",
        "Jamal: You got busted, man? ",
        "Jack: You don't have to wave it in front of my face, all right? I know I've \r\nlost Livvie over this. The one good thing in my life, and I had to mess it up.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Lucy Coe, man -- ",
        "Jack: Hey -- ",
        "Alison: Livvie hasn't been to visit her grandmother. ",
        "Jack: Where is she? Man, I've looked everywhere. Except -- I'll see you guys \r\nlater. ",
        "Alison: Whatever. Come on. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no. Listen, I'll be right back. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, Frank, you got a second? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, sure. ",
        "Jamal: I was wondering what you and Alison were talking about a few minutes \r\nago. She was saying something about, like, needing some cash or something. ",
        "Frank: You know, I think you should talk to Alison about that. I don't want \r\nto get in the middle of your stuff, all right? ",
        "Alison: Hey, hey, hey, wait. Don't we have a non-snooping policy in this \r\nrelationship? Please. ",
        "Jamal: All right, come on, Alison. Be straight with me. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: What are you keeping from me? ",
        "Alison: Nothing. Nothing -- it's just -- it's just this crazy idea that I had \r\nthat we really can't afford anyway, so don't worry about it, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know we've been strapped for some cash lately -- ",
        "Alison: No, no, it's ok. I just got a nice tip from those people over there, \r\nall right? We'll be fine. I promise. ",
        "Jamal: Not if don't carry my own weight. ",
        "Jamal: Travis? Jamal. Yeah, that gig we were talking about? Yeah, two Gs for \r\ndriving the car tomorrow night? Is the deal still on the table? ",
        "",
        "Chris: Thank you. Look, Livvie, you know that I've wanted you for a long \r\ntime. ",
        "Livvie: Good. Because now the wait's over. ",
        "Chris: Not like this. Not when you're acting like some wounded little girl.\r\n",
        "Livvie: I cannot believe that you're turning me down. ",
        "Chris: Neither can I. Must mean I really like you. ",

        "Livvie: God, please don't answer that. ",
        "[Pounding on door] ",

        "Chris: What do you want? ",
        "Jack: Where is she? I've looked everywhere, and I know she's got to be here.\r\n",
        "Chris: Well, if you're referring to Livvie, she's a big girl, Jack. She can \r\ntake care of herself. ",
        "Jack: Look, I know she usually comes to you when she's upset. So if she's --\r\n",
        "Chris: So if she's here, that would mean she's upset. And I guess the cause \r\nof that would most likely be you. Livvie, I thought you would stay in the \r\nbedroom. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I don't need to hide my relationships from Jack. He's the \r\nliar. I'm not. ",

        "Colleen: Oh, excuse me. Eve, could you come out to the desk for a minute? ",
        "Eve: I'll be right back. We have to finish this conversation. ",

        "Arianna: He just paid me a visit. ",

        "Arianna: All the charges have been dropped. ",
        "Ian: Did he hurt you? ",

        "Ian: He wants to make peace. ",
        "Arianna: He doesn't believe our marriage is real. ",
        "Ian: Our marriage is legal and binding, so he can just go to hell. ",
        "Arianna: There are people who know you're in love with Eve. Even Ben is \r\nsuspicious. Like, if he'd seen the way you were looking at Eve just now -- ",

        "Arianna: He blames Eve for putting him behind bars. ",

        "Livvie: God, what is wrong with you? ",
        "Jack: Can't you see he's using you? ",
        "Livvie: Well, you should know a thing or two about that. God, are you all \r\nright? ",

        "Jack: No. No, I'm not leaving here without her. ",
        "Livvie: Don't you get it, Jack? I am exactly where I want to be. I came here \r\non my own free will. ",

        "Livvie: Now, what's that supposed to mean? ",
        "Chris: I just was thinking about the time that you were angry with Rachel. \r\nRemember? You tried to make her think that we were sleeping together to get back \r\nat her. ",
        "Livvie: Aren't you the one who told me to get rid of Jack? ",
        "Chris: This isn't about what I want, Livvie. It's what you want. Or do \r\nyou even know what that is? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I thought I did. ",
        "Chris: Well, don't you think it's about time you take responsibility for your \r\nactions? It's the only way you're ever going to stop being the victim, a role \r\nthat you claim to hate. ",
        "Livvie: I do. ",

        "Ian: What do you mean? ",
        "Arianna: I mean, I've just seen with my own eyes that your feelings for Eve \r\nare very much alive. So I have to ask, can you still do this? And is it fair?\r\n",
        "Ian: Hey, we're married, and you're safe. ",
        "Arianna: Marriages can be annulled. Mistakes are made all the time. And I \r\nthink it was wrong to take you away from the woman you love. ",
        "Ian: Didn't have a choice. Your life was on the line. ",
        "Arianna: If you want out of this marriage, I'll let you go, and I'll move on. \r\nBut if you stay, we have to make this look good. ",

        "Eve: I promise. ",
        "Ian: You were right about Arianna's brother. He's more dangerous than we \r\nknow. He wants to take her out of the country and kill her. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Yes. This marriage is her only hope. Her family wants to make her pay \r\nfor something that she did, supposedly, something that happened to her and left \r\na mark of shame on them. So they sent her own brother to do an honor killing.\r\n",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. ",
        "Ian: Do you understand that's why we have to make this work until I can \r\nfigure out something else? But you got to believe something. I love you. I love \r\nyou more than life itself. ",
        "Eve: I knew it. I knew you felt the same way. ",
        "Ian: But I can't have this, not now. Not now, not the way we planned. ",
        "Eve: Is there anything else we can do, Ian? ",
        "Ian: No, no. You have to accept this. This is a matter of life and death. And \r\nthis is the way it has to be. Please, tell me you understand. ",
        "Eve: I understand. Ok? ",
        "Ian: Ok. I have to go and be with my wife. Hey. Let's go home. \r\n\u00a0",
        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" -- ",
        "Karen: If Ian loves you as much as you said he does, why would he marry \r\nanother woman? ",
        "Arianna: How long should I wait before trying to get pregnant? ",
        "Lucy: You look different. ",
        "Livvie: We went out, and we did a little shopping. ",
