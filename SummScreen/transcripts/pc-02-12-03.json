        "Lucy offers words of encouragement to a very discouraged Ian. When she surprises him with a visit from Tim and Danny, Ian gets to spend some time with his little boy. At Kevin's request, Caleb visits his jail cell. Kevin wants his help getting out of jail. Caleb agrees to help, with two conditions. The first one is that Kevin has to keep Lucy out of the Caleb's hair. As for the second condition, Caleb will ask a favor of Kevin at some point in the future, and Kevin must comply. Reese and \"Marissa\" face off in the park, and the angel uses her powers to knock her adversary off her feet. Jamal witnesses this and later confronts her about it. He knows that she's really Casey, not Marissa. Casey is upset about blowing her cover, but she's relieved by Jamal's offer to teach her how to be Marissa. Home again, Kevin thinks about his plans for his wife and her lover, and they're not pretty. Alison explains why she's changed her mind about letting Tess try to heal Caleb. Grateful for Alison's belief in her, Tess goes to try to find \"Stephen\" so that she can heal him. When Jack finds out, he's furious with Alison for talking her into this and endangering her life. At the studio, Joshua informs Tess that they have some unfinished business. Alarmed, Tess tries to get away, but Joshua insists on straightening things out. He apologizes for trying to kill her, then says that he doesn't want her to stay away from \"Stephen\" after all. Jack and Alison come to her rescue, and Alison is stunned to see the man her mother killed. Caleb is very angry with Joshua and asks for a reason not to kill him."

        "Lucy: Um -- oh, you know, ok, I'm not good at cooking. I've admitted that several times, but usually somebody could at least try the eggs. They tend to be edible occasionally when --",
        "Ian: I'm really not that hungry.",
        "Lucy: Why? Is last night still bothering you?",
        "Ian: Yeah. I'm still trying to figure out the big picture.",
        "Lucy: Oh, you knew what I meant. Come on.",
        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Ian: I don't know, but, yeah -- I -- hey -- I thought I was doing better, and then all of a sudden I got pulled into the woods like some -- some mindless animal.",
        "Lucy: I know, but you could not help that.",
        "Ian: I can't live like this. I can't have someone like Caleb have control over me like this.",
        "Lucy: He doesn't. He doesn't. When he called out all his vampires, you were able to resist.",
        "Ian: What does it matter?",
        "Lucy: It matters a lot. Because that -- that says you were strong enough to resist him --",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Lucy: And it means you are still you. You are still you inside there.",
        "Ian: Strong enough to resist him, yeah. I hope I can believe all that.",
        "Lucy: You can.",
        "Ian: Am I keeping you from something?",
        "Lucy: Uh -- no. No, I was just expecting a delivery of some sort.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lucy: Ah -- and there's my delivery now!",
        "Ian: What delivery? What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: Nothing. Just a little old surprise for you.",
        "Ian: I don't like surprises.",
        "Lucy: Too bad, because this one you're going to like a lot. Hey, hey, hey, come in.",
        "Tim: Hi. Hey, buddy, who's that?",
        "[Lucy chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You really think I can help Stephen?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know you can.",
        "Tess: But everyone's told me to stay away from him -- even you.",
        "Alison: I've been thinking about what I said a lot about that lately, and I just -- Tess, the bottom line is, is I believe in miracles. I've seen proof of them.",
        "Tess: Miracles?",
        "Alison: I just don't -- I just don't think that there's a way out for people like Stephen and my mother. I don't believe that their souls are lost forever, you know?",
        "Tess: I don't believe that, either.",
        "Alison: I know you don't. And I know that you're a healer and you've performed miracles yourself. And you did that last night. I mean, you did the impossible. You got Caleb to call off all of the vampires. You have some sort of special bond with him, some sort of special connection that nobody else has. You can get through to him.",
        "Tess: It's because I can see the good inside him. It's there and it wants to come out.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I think that it does, too. And if you really try hard, I think that you can change Caleb's heart forever and make sure that he doesn't hurt another person ever again.",
        "Tess: Thank you.",
        "Alison: For what?",
        "Tess: For believing in me in the way you do. No one else has done that.",
        "Alison: Nobody? I mean, Jack doesn't believe in you?",
        "Tess: No, I mean, Jack -- Jack loves me, and I know that, but he doesn't understand. It's not just what I want to do, it's what I have to do.",
        "Alison: Right, it's what you have to do.",
        "Tess: Because when I see someone in pain, in so much pain, it hurts me, too. And Stephen, he has more pain than anyone, more hurt than anyone. He needs me.",
        "Alison: Right. And I think that you should go heal him.",
        "Tess: Ok.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Alison: I hope you can heal us all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Well, well. It's come to this.",
        "Kevin: Hey, you got my message.",
        "Caleb: So this is where the amateurs end up.",
        "Kevin: Thank you. I'm glad you find this amusing.",
        "Caleb: Why'd you call, Doc?",
        "Kevin: Well, because you're going to help me get out of here.",
        "Caleb: You say that like you might have something that I want. But from where I'm standing, this door is locked, and it's staying that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Well, well, well. If it isn't our little songbird.",
        "Casey: What do they say in your country, Reese? Oh, yeah -- sod off.",
        "Reese: Not until we get something straight, princess. Ricky is off-limits.",
        "Casey: Oh, what, he's hooked up with you?",
        "Reese: Let's just say I have plans for that boy that don't include you.",
        "Casey: He's in more trouble than I thought.",
        "Reese: Excuse me?",
        "Casey: Listen, slut-cakes, Ricky Garza's got more sense than to waste his life on a skanky garden tool like you.",
        "Reese: You little --",
        "[Reese yells]",
        "Casey: Yes, Reese? You were saying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Alison.",
        "Alison: Hi. I just -- I stopped by to say hi.",
        "Jack: Ok. Well, where's Tess? Does she know you're here?",
        "Alison: Yeah, we had a nice little talk.",
        "Jack: Well, where is she now?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I think she -- I think she went to go run an errand or something.",
        "Jack: \"An errand or something\"? What kind of errand?",
        "Alison: I don't know. She didn't say.",
        "Jack: Ok, Alison, you're acting really funny. What's up?",
        "Alison: No, I'm not. No, everything's fine. Nothing's wrong.",
        "Jack: Now, we're friends, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah. We're best friends.",
        "Jack: Ok, then tell me what's going on. Tess is my wife, and we're in the fight of our lives. If you think there's something I should know --",
        "Alison: Ok. Ok, but when I tell you this, please don't get upset with me. It's really not -- it's not as bad as it's going to sound --",
        "Jack: What's not that bad? Where's Tess?",
        "Alison: She went to go see Caleb. She went to try and heal him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Stephen?",
        "Tess: Stephen, are you here?",
        "Joshua: Tess. What a pleasant surprise. I believe you and I have some unfinished business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Have you forgotten that I got you access to Tess? I can do that again.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. But I don't need your help with Tess anymore. See, we've sort of formed a little bond of our own. You might even say we've become friends. Speaking of which, in times like this, isn't that what you people do? You turn to your friends?",
        "Kevin: Yes, but my friends won't help me. Not even my own father.",
        "Caleb: Bummer. I guess they all figured out you're nuttier than a fruitcake. Well, it's been real, Doc --",
        "Kevin: Wait, wait. I really need to get out of here.",
        "Caleb: For what? To kill your wife and her boyfriend? It's so unoriginal.",
        "Kevin: You know, my wife is a slayer of those like you.",
        "Caleb: So what? You're proposing if I get you out of here, you'll kill Lucy? Is that what this is all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Look at you, Danny, you've gotten so big.",
        "Tim: Yeah, you'll see how big when you lug him around for awhile.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Lucy: Hey, it's all -- it's all right. It's ok.",
        "Ian: Hey, boy.",
        "Ian: Help me.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Ian: I can't do it. Get him out of here.",
        "Tim: Oh.",
        "Lucy: Um --",
        "Ian: That was a bad idea. You shouldn't have done that.",
        "Lucy: No, no -- wait, could you -- just a second, ok?",
        "Tim: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. It wasn't a bad idea. It's ok. I know what you're thinking. You won't hurt him, I know that.",
        "Ian: Yeah, I wish to God I could believe that.",
        "Lucy: You can. It's true. I believe that with my whole being. I wouldn't have brought him here otherwise. Please --",
        "Ian: I can't have him seeing me like a monster. I can't have that.",
        "Lucy: He won't see you like that, because that's not what you are. Last night you proved it. You're just you. Go to him.",
        "Ian: Hey. Little man, come here.",
        "Tim: All right.",
        "Ian: I -- I've missed you. You have no idea how much.",
        "[Danny coos]",
        "Ian: What? Do you want some of this food? It's not very good, buddy. Do you want to try some?",
        "Lucy: Oh!",
        "Ian: Lucy cooked it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I never said anything about killing Lucy.",
        "Caleb: But you want to, don't you, Doc? I know all about vengeance. She put you in here. And now she's sleeping with another man. No jury in my world would convict you.",
        "Kevin: What I do about Lucy and Thornhart is my business.",
        "Caleb: But you're asking me to make it mine. Hmm. I'll tell you what. Keep her distracted, out of my face, off her toes.",
        "Kevin: You almost make it sound like you're protecting her.",
        "Caleb: Well, to be honest with you, even thought she's a slayer, I am much more fond of Lucy than I am of you, Doc. But, like you say, what you do when you're out of here is your business.",
        "Kevin: So you will help me?",
        "Caleb: Consider yourself sprung. There is one other stipulation.",
        "Kevin: Name it.",
        "Caleb: Someday in the future -- maybe tomorrow, maybe 10 years from now -- I'm going to come to you and I'll need a favor. And you, no questions asked, will grant me that favor. Do we have an understanding?",
        "Kevin: Understood.",
        "Caleb: Then we have a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: How did you do that?",
        "Casey: Oh -- do what, Reese?",
        "Reese: That branch came out of nowhere and totally knocked me down.",
        "Casey: Yeah? Well, I think that's what you call being a klutz, or -- or wasted. Although you know what? It does seem early enough even for you.",
        "Reese: I am not wasted.",
        "Casey: Oh, yeah?",
        "Reese: And you're going to so wish you hadn't done that.",
        "Casey: Bite me.",
        "Reese: Oh, I'd love to. Someday, little girl.",
        "Casey: I can't wait.",
        "Casey: Look, I know, I know, ok? \"Bite me,\" a little too close to home, but you know what? The little booger was pissing me off.",
        "Jamal: Who are you talking to? Hey.",
        "Casey: Oh, hey. Uh, nobody.",
        "Jamal: Nobody?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Jamal: Seems like a long conversation to be having with nobody.",
        "Casey: Uh -- well, you know, sometimes, I -- I like talking to the clouds.",
        "Jamal: No, I don't know, because you don't do that, Marissa. In fact, you don't do anything you used to do. But I did see how you made that branch jump off the ground and knock Reese on her butt. I did see that.",
        "Casey: You saw that?",
        "Jamal: Yeah. In fact, I'm starting to see everything now -- Casey. It is you, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, you're telling me Tess went to see Caleb, and you just let her go? God, I hope it's not too late.",
        "Alison: No, wait, Jack. I don't think that you should go.",
        "Jack: What??",
        "Alison: I don't think that you should try and stop her. She thinks that maybe she can turn Caleb around, and I think that she can. You should at least let her try.",
        "Jack: Alison, do you remember who we're dealing with here?",
        "Alison: I know who we're dealing with here. I know Caleb, and I know what he's done. But if she thinks that -- that she can get through to him, then can't you at least let her try? I think that she can do it again. Last night was proof of that.",
        "Jack: Alison --",
        "Alison: She's special. So why isn't this possible? Please, why?",
        "Jack: You put her up to this, didn't you?",
        "Alison: No, I didn't. I just thought that maybe --",
        "Jack: No, I don't care what you thought. You had no right to put her in this kind of danger.",
        "Alison: I -- he's not going to hurt her.",
        "Jack: He doesn't give a damn about Tess. All he's after is Livvie!",
        "Alison: Jack, please -- I just thought that maybe --",
        "Jack: No, no. She's in danger. And you better hope it's not too late to stop it.",
        "Alison: Wait -- I'm going to come with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Where is Stephen? I'm -- I'm here to see Stephen.",
        "Joshua: Well, Stephen's not here. Therefore, I'm afraid it's just you and me.",
        "Tess: I'll come back later.",
        "Joshua: You're frightened of me, aren't you? I mean, I can understand that. But there's no reason to be. I -- I'm not going to hurt you.",
        "Tess: You tried to kill me and Livvie. You pushed us into the river.",
        "Joshua: I'm really sorry about that. No, I really am. I was having an unbelievably bad day and I made a mistake and I -- I regret it. But you're so good and you're so pure, you -- you haven't told anyone, particularly Stephen. And I know you're going to find it in your heart to forgive me.",
        "Tess: You're not sorry. I don't believe you.",
        "Joshua: Tess --",
        "Tess: You're bad. You're very bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, Jamal, I don't know what you're talking about. I mean --",
        "[Jamal sighs]",
        "Casey: You actually think that I, Marissa, am Casey.",
        "Jamal: Come on, come on, come on, kill all that noise, ok? I've been following you, ok? I've seen you in action.",
        "Casey: Great! Great. No one's supposed to know about this! Ed is going to kill me!",
        "Jamal: Funny, I thought you already were dead.",
        "Casey: I am dead. I'm an angel, ok? I have been ever since you met me. What -- no -- no shock? No freaking out?",
        "Jamal: Are you serious? That's supposed to surprise me? I'm from Port Charles, ok? No, but I do have one question for you.",
        "Casey: Ok, just one?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, just one. Where's your sister Marissa?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Um -- I -- I had to send her away.",
        "Jamal: You what?",
        "Casey: Look, she -- she was about to out Stephen as a vampire, all right? She would have gotten herself killed. So I didn't know what else to do, so I sent her home and I --",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. I understand. Ok, that's fine. I've been actually trying to get through to her so she could see how much danger she's been in, but --",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Jamal: I'm just glad you got through to her.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. So, where is she? I want to see her. Come on, where is she at?",
        "Casey: Um -- you can't, Jamal. She's off-limits to you and to everybody else.",
        "Jamal: Oh, wait, wait, wait --",
        "Casey: No, you know what? If you -- if you even bring her back into this, she'll get pulled in and she'll die, all right? You got to leave her alone.",
        "Jamal: I don't believe this.",
        "Casey: Look, man, if it makes any difference, it was really hard for her to leave you. I mean, she -- she really digs you.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Casey: The important thing is that she's all right. Right?",
        "Jamal: Yeah. She really is ok, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah. And look, I'm sorry you had to see me macking on Ricky like that. It's just I missed him so much, you know?",
        "Jamal: Don't worry about it. I understand. I mean, I understand now. Does Ricky know?",
        "Casey: No. No, and he can't. He doesn't -- he doesn't need to know that I'm his guardian angel, ok?",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok, don't worry about it. I'm not going to tell anybody. Besides, I don't think anybody would believe me, anyway.",
        "Casey: Thank you.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. No problem. But I got to tell you, you're doing a pretty bang-up job at playing Marissa. It's not too good.",
        "Casey: I know, I know, I know. It's just so hard. I -- I didn't think it was going to be this hard.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know. Just -- you'll be ok. Just need a few pointers from somebody who really knew her well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: All right, little man. You be good for uncle Tim, ok? Do you want another one of these? I'm going to keep fighting. And that's why we're going to be a family again. All right? Come on.",
        "Tim: All right, big guy.",
        "Ian: Goodbye, boy.",
        "Tim: Say \"bye-bye.\"",
        "Ian: Thank you. Bye.",
        "Lucy: Hey, he'll be back before you know it. This whole separation thing, it's just -- it's just temporary, that's all.",
        "Ian: How did you know? How did you know that was exactly what I needed?",
        "Lucy: Lucky guess, I guess.",
        "Ian: I feel like a father again.",
        "Lucy: And that's never going to change, ever.",
        "Ian: Thank God for you, Lucy. Thank God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Huh. I see your future, Lucy and Ian. And it's not pretty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You're a bad man. I don't believe a word you're saying.",
        "Joshua: I just want you to listen to me. I'm trying to explain to you that I was wrong. I don't want you to stay away from Stephen. On the contrary, I think you're exactly what he deserves.",
        "Tess: I don't have to talk to you. Get away from me.",
        "Joshua: No, you don't have to talk to me, but you have to listen to me. Listen to what I have to say.",
        "Tess: Jack!",
        "Jack: Get your hands off of her!",
        "Tess: Oh, God.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Alison: God, it's you.",
        "Joshua: Yes, my dear, it's me. I'm back. Boo.",
        "Tess: Can you please take me home?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Tess: He doesn't like me.",
        "Jack: Let's go. We're going.",
        "Tess: Leav",
        "Alison: Yeah, we all -- we all have to get out of here.",
