        "Lucy: Doc. Where have you been? You said you would be right over. Have you \r\nseen her? Tell me, have you seen her? ",
        "Kevin: Seen who? ",
        "Lucy: Livvie. Who else? Did she spend the night at your place last night? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what's going on? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. She found out about Jack and me -- me and Jack, you know, \r\nalmost -- ",
        "Kevin: You mean she knows that you and Jack almost -- ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, yes, yes, and she completely lost it. And now, given \r\neverything she's been through lately, I'm not sure what this might push her to \r\ndo. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ok, here's the soda you wanted, plenty of ice like you said. ",
        "Karen: Thank you. ",
        "Eve: Wait, maybe you didn't say ice. ",
        "Karen: No, it's ok. Eve, Eve, will you sit down? ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Karen: Ok? Thank you. ",
        "Eve: Thanks. ",
        "Karen: Ok, what's wrong? ",
        "Eve: What do you mean? ",
        "Karen: I mean you haven't returned my messages in days and you haven't \r\nstopped fussing since I got here. I'm worried about you. ",
        "Eve: Karen, don't be. I'm fine, really. ",
        "Karen: Oh, come on. Last time I saw you, you were running off to look for Ian \r\nto tell him you remembered being in love with him. So how did he end up being \r\nmarried to Arianna? That's the rumor going around. ",
        "Eve: It's not a rumor. It's true. ",
        "Karen: Well, that doesn't make sense. If Ian loves you as much as you said he \r\ndoes, why would he marry another woman? ",
        "",
        "Joe: She got her memory back? ",
        "Ian: Yes. And I was this close to having everything I ever wanted in my life. \r\nEve said she was going to be with me. ",
        "Joe: Only you can't be with her. ",
        "Ian: No. Not now. ",
        "Joe: Did you tell her why? ",
        "Ian: I'm saving a life here. I made a promise to Arianna. ",
        "Joe: Maybe you did, but -- ",
        "Ian: And that's how it's going to be. ",
        "Joe: Just like that? \"Eve, it was nice knowing you, but you and I are \r\nthrough?\" ",
        "Ian: Yeah, just like that. No, I -- what am I going to do, Joseph? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Doc? Doc, did you hear what I just said? Your daughter is out there \r\nsomewhere doing who-knows-what. Don't you care? ",
        "Kevin: Doing who-knows-wh-- of course I care! What do you expect me to do \r\nabout it now? She found out that you were fooling around with her boyfriend! ",
        "Lucy: Almost fooled around. Almost. Almost. ",
        "Kevin: What did you expect her to do, Lucy, rent a video and share her \r\npopcorn with you? ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait just a minute. She's not just mad at me. She's also very mad \r\nat you because you lied to her. But you're going to blame this on me, aren't \r\nyou? It's always me. Well, you know what? Let's make this about Jack, shall we? \r\nJack happens to be out there trying to win back the woman he loves, unlike \r\nsome people I know. ",
        "Kevin: Don't you dare. Don't you even try to turn this around on me. Wrong \r\nplace, wrong time. Right now I've got to find my daughter. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, no, you don't, Dad. Because she's right here. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie? ",
        "Lucy: You look -- different. ",
        "Livvie: Well, time for a change, that's all. Actually, past time. So we went \r\nout and we did a little shopping and -- ",
        "Kevin and Lucy: \"We?\" ",
        "Chris: We. What do you think, huh? A real knockout. ",
        "Livvie: Well, who cares what they think. I'm just going to grab a few things. \r\nThen I'll be right back, honey. ",
        "Kevin: \"Honey?\" ",
        "Chris: Funny how things work out, isn't it? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Only Ian can say why he did what he did. I'm sure he has his reasons for \r\nmarrying Arianna. ",
        "Karen: And I'd sure like to know what they are. Wouldn't you? ",
        "Eve: He thought things were over between us, Karen. He thought I was going to \r\nspend the rest of my life with Kevin. ",
        "Karen: Maybe you can understand how a guy could be crazy in love with one \r\nwoman on Tuesday and then turn around and elope with another one two weeks \r\nlater, but I can't. ",
        "Eve: Well, sometimes happy endings just have a way of running in the other \r\ndirection. It's lousy, but it happens. ",
        "Karen: If it happened to me, it wouldn't be this easy. ",
        "Eve: Believe me, if there's one thing this isn't, it's easy. ",
        "Karen: Then why keep defending him? ",
        "Eve: Because some things are just out of my hands. ",
        "Karen: Look, true love doesn't come around twice a week. Either Ian is in \r\nlove with you or he's not, and if he is -- ",
        "Eve: Karen, stop it, please. It's over. Ian cannot be with me. That's all \r\nthat matters. So just drop it, ok? Drop it. ",
        "",
        "Mary: Ian. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Mary: Well, congratulations. How's the happy groom? ",
        "Ian: You heard, then? ",
        "Mary: Oh, are you kidding? There's not a soul at the hospital who isn't \r\nthrilled for you. ",
        "Ian: Well, lovely. Thanks. ",
        "Mary: And now that you've finally met your special someone, I hope the rest \r\nof us will get to meet her soon. Like tonight at our Valentine's party? ",
        "Ian: Well, I appreciate the invitation, but tonight is -- ",
        "Mary: Oh, couldn't you just stop by for a minute? Bob's bringing up some \r\nspecial champagne from downstairs and, well, I was hoping I could get to toast \r\nyou and your marriage. ",
        "Joe: Rain check, mom. You'll meet Arianna, don't worry. ",
        "Mary: Well, make that a promise and I'll let you off the hook. ",
        "Ian: A promise it is. ",
        "Mary: Oh, I'd better tell Bob to stop bringing up those bottles. ",
        "Ian: What? I'm not going to be out in public with Arianna pretending to be \r\nthe happy couple when the only woman I'm thinking of is Eve. ",
        "",
        "Ben's Voice: I'll believe in your marriage the day that you can prove that \r\nyou are carrying Ian's child. ",
        "Gabriela: Arianna. Hi. ",
        "Arianna: Hey. ",
        "Gabriela: Why aren't you inside? ",
        "Arianna: Oh, I -- I was waiting for Ian. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, well, how about waiting where it's warm? Come on. ",
        "Arianna: Wait, just one second please. ",
        "Gabriela: Something wrong? ",
        "Arianna: No, not wrong, but I have a question maybe you may be able to help \r\nme with. It's a medical question. ",
        "Gabriela: Sure. What is it? ",
        "Arianna: After having a -- a miscarriage, how long should I wait before \r\ntrying to get pregnant again? ",
        "Gabriela: You plan to get pregnant? ",
        "Arianna: No. No, not exactly. I was just, you know, wondering. ",
        "Gabriela: Have you talked to Ian about this? ",
        "Arianna: In our situation, it's ridiculous to even consider having children, \r\nbut -- ",
        "Gabriela: What? What is it? ",
        "Arianna: It's just so hard. ",
        "Gabriela: You mean the way you feel about losing your baby? ",
        "Arianna: Yes. And I guess I just got carried away for a moment. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I'm sorry. But you never know. I mean, you and Ian could grow \r\nto care for each other. ",
        "Arianna: Do you really think that's possible? ",
        "Gabriela: This is America. Anything's possible. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Can't just turn off the way I feel, Joseph. ",
        "Joe: No one's saying you have to, all right? Love Eve all you want. Just \r\ndon't let Arianna's brother and your friends from Immigration in on it, that's \r\nall. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, right. It's easier said than done. Ah. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey-ya, handsome. ",
        "Joe: Hey. I was starting to go into withdrawal. ",
        "Gabriela: Can't have that, can we? ",
        "Ian: How about you? Got a squeeze for the old man? ",
        "Arianna: Of course. ",
        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Mary: Oh, well, there you are -- the latest lovers. Mrs. Thornhart, I \r\npresume? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Arianna, Mary Collins. That's Joe's mother and the proud owner of \r\nthis establishment. ",
        "Arianna: It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Collins. ",
        "Mary: Oh, it's a pleasure. Mary, please. Oh, I suspected you were a man of \r\ntaste, Ian, and this proves it. But I'm warning you right now, you take extra \r\ngood care of her, and not just now -- forever. That's what a real marriage is \r\nabout, isn't it? Till death do us part. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Karen, I'm so sorry. I really am. ",
        "Karen: For what? ",
        "Eve: Going off on you like that. ",
        "Karen: Hey, it's me, your best friend. You don't have to pretend Ian being \r\nmarried isn't killing you. ",
        "Eve: When I found out about it, I couldn't breathe. I had just had this \r\nreally great talk with Kevin, and we still love each other -- as friends. And I \r\nwas happy. I felt free. And I was on my way to be with Ian. I thought we were \r\ngoing to be together, finally. ",
        "Karen: And that's when you found out? ",
        "Eve: She's a great girl. Arianna is beautiful and -- and brave. ",
        "Karen: So are you. That and more. ",
        "Eve: You know what? We can't talk about this anymore. We've wasted enough \r\ntime already. Let's talk about you for a change, all right? What's going on with \r\nyou? What's -- what's going on with Frank? Did you manage to squeeze another \r\ndate out of him or what? ",
        "Karen: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Eve: And? ",
        "Karen: My parents came as chaperones. ",
        "Eve: Parents? ",
        "Karen: Parents, yes, yes, plural. Rhonda's moved back in town. At least for a \r\nlittle while, anyway. I'm kind of getting used to the idea, so we'll see. ",
        "Eve: And are you getting used to the idea of Frank? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. Oh, oh, and guess what -- he bought me something. Actually, \r\nyou'll never guess. A 30-year-old computer. You won't believe it when you see \r\nit. ",
        "Eve: An obsolete computer. ",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: Oh, the magic of Frank Scanlon! ",
        "Karen: It was very sweet of him. ",
        "Eve: Uh-huh. ",
        "Karen: And now he's fixing it up for me and -- oh. ",
        "Eve: And what? ",
        "Karen: Oh, God, I swore I wouldn't do it again. Ever since I got out of \r\nrehab, I said I wouldn't. ",
        "Eve: Wouldn't what? ",
        "Karen: Fall for a nice guy like Frank because they never end up being nice in \r\nthe end, right? ",
        "Eve: Hey, the last thing you need to do is get cynical about men, ok? ",
        "Karen: How can you say that after what Ian just did? ",
        "Eve: He's with someone else now. But that doesn't mean that what we had \r\nwasn't real. The time that we spent together and the things we shared -- I won't \r\nforget it, ever. And I don't regret any of it. I never will. ",

        "Kevin: Don't you think my daughter's a little young for you, doctor? ",
        "Chris: Well, you don't know your daughter very well, do you? ",
        "Kevin: Well, she doesn't know who she's dealing with either, does she? She's \r\nhurt. She's confused. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, and he's loving every minute of it. Aren't you? Look at his face. \r\nYou got it, huh? You finally got what you wanted. Ever since Livvie came to Port \r\nCharles, you wanted to get her in your bed. Because you've tried, let's see, \r\neverything else moving in this town to get them in your bed. At least you've \r\nattempted it, made the effort. ",
        "Livvie: Look who's talking. You're the one who got naked with Chris' brother.\r\n",
        "Chris: What? ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute! ",
        "Lucy: What? Jack is Chris' brother? ",
        "Chris: Surprise, surprise. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, this just gets better and better. Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: Save it. You gave up your right to play daddy a long time ago. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, wait a minute. Look, if you want to be mad at me, that's fine. I \r\ndeserve it. I wasn't honest with you. But that's only -- ",
        "Livvie: Wait -- you were only trying to protect me. How many times have I \r\nheard that line? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, if you're going off with him just to punish us -- ",
        "Livvie: I'm just doing what everyone else around here does -- looking out for \r\nme and grabbing whatever it takes to make me happy. ",
        "Lucy: Chris is certainly not going to make you happy, Livvie. Come on, Jack \r\nwill make you happy. You and Jack belong together. ",
        "Chris: Excuse me, but isn't it in really poor taste to be pushing a guy on to \r\nLivvie that, well, you yourself just pushed yourself on to? ",
        "Kevin: Shut up, Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: I'm just asking. ",
        "Kevin: Get out. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you heard him. Get out. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, we both heard you. Didn't we, Chris? We have a Valentine's \r\nparty to get to, anyway. Oh, and I'm going to be sending for the rest of my \r\nthings. ",
        "Chris: Oh, by the way, Lucy, about what you said earlier about me finally \r\ngetting what I wanted? You're right. You see, you were the one who pushed her \r\nright into my arms. ",
        "Kevin: That son of a -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait, Doc, no, you can't do that. ",
        "Kevin: I don't want my daughter anywhere near that creep! ",
        "Lucy: I know, I know. I don't want her to be with Chris, either, but she's an \r\nadult. There's nothing we can do right at this moment. But we can start by \r\ntrying to get Livvie and Jack back together. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I don't want Livvie with Jack. ",
        "Lucy: What are you doing? Where are you going? ",
        "Kevin: I'm taking care of my daughter whether she likes it or not. ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, you're not. You're just going to make everything worse -- \r\nmuch, much, much worse. Ok, time to take matters into my own hands. There is a \r\nValentine's party. Ok, so I go there and I make sure that everybody who belongs \r\ntogether ends up together. That's what I'll do. Yeah. ",

        "Livvie: Proud? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, for standing up to Kevin and Lucy the way you did. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I did not do this for you, you know. I couldn't care less about \r\nmaking anybody else proud. All I care about is going in there and having a \r\nreally great time tonight. Think you can handle that? ",
        "Chris: I'm sure of it. After you. One great time coming up. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Jack? It's me, Lucy. Listen, remember that job I promised you, the one \r\nto help out with your probation? Well, it's time for you to punch that old time \r\nclock. Listen, I want you to put on your nicest shirt and pants and I want you \r\nto get over here as soon as you can because you are taking me to a party. ",

        "Kevin: I didn't know you were here. ",

        "Kevin: Any other surprises? Or is it just the two of us? ",
        "Eve: Karen just left. You missed her. She went to the Valentine's party. ",

        "Eve: What? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie found out that Lucy and I were keeping something from her. \r\nDon't ask. The important thing is she's turned to Chris for comfort. ",
        "Eve: Oh, Kevin, I'm sorry. ",
        "Kevin: Listen, I thought I could leave this alone, but I just have to go over \r\nthere and see if I can put a stop to this. ",

        "Ian: Right. ",
        "Joe: But if you don't start loosening up a little, people are going to start \r\ntalking, all right, and asking questions. Look, she's doing a great job, all \r\nright? You're the one that's got to start convincing people that your heart is \r\nin this thing. ",
