        "Alison: Excuse me. I know that you're really busy up there and all, but \r\nRafe's time on earth is -- is almost running out. And he's helped so many \r\npeople. Isn't it time that maybe we helped him? I mean, it's not really like I'm \r\nasking for any special favor or anything. I mean, no, that's not true. I'm \r\nsorry. I am sort of asking for a special favor. I mean, I know that he can't \r\nstay forever, but can't we just cut him a break? I mean, what harm would be done \r\nif maybe giving him like one summer? You know, like one perfect summer. You \r\ncould call it a bonus for a job well done. And maybe since we're already \r\ntalking, I'm really worried about Jamal. But I'm sure that you already know that \r\nby now. ",
        "Rafe: I'm not sure the boss does. But I do. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, I'm so sorry. I -- ",
        "Rafe: No, don't be sorry. I know what we have is magic. But I also know that \r\nJamal is still very much on your mind. ",

        "Andy: His call cut off before we could pinpoint the location. But we know the \r\ngeneral area, ok? It's outside town on the interstate. ",
        "Eve: Is he hurt? Does he need medical help? ",
        "Andy: We don't know. But, hey, we'll find him. Just hang tight. ",

        "Eve: You don't know that. ",
        "Chris: Eve, the cops are on it. ",
        "Eve: I don't care. I am not going to just sit here and wait for the cops to \r\nfind my husband. I'm going to go out there and look for him myself. ",

        "Ian: I'm not sure about this. ",
        "Amy: What choice do we have? ",
        "Ian: Well, if I could get my leg free, then maybe I could drive. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: You have to tell us now. There are four of us. There are five chairs. \r\nSo someone's got to be coming back with us, right? Someone's going to die? ",
        "Ed's Voice: People die every day. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: Right, but this is different, isn't it? It's going to be someone who's \r\nclose to one of us. ",
        "Ian: Amy? ",
        "Amy: Let's roll. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Sorry about the close quarters. ",
        "Amy: Well, you could always let me steer, unless you got a thing against \r\nblind people driving. ",
        "Ian: Are you going to give me a break with that? ",
        "Amy: Here goes nothing. ",
        "Ian: Just give it some gas. Nice and easy. ",
        "Amy: Mm-hmm. Aren't we a pair? Your leg is stuck and I can't see. ",

        "Alison: You're right. What we have is magic. You know, and I should not be \r\ntalking about Jamal when we're together. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, listen to me. I know that you can't just turn off your feelings \r\nfor him. I understand that. Come here. This must be ripping you up inside. ",
        "Alison: Well, it's just that, you know, Jamal will always have a special \r\nplace in my heart. He was my -- my first love, you know, and the only person \r\nthat I'd ever been with until now. I mean, I'm sad that Jamal and I couldn't \r\nmake it, but there's no way that I would ever let you go. ",

        "Rafe: Or pushed into anything. ",
        "Alison: No, no. No, no, no, no. I don't -- I don't feel wrong being with you. \r\nI mean, I'm not hiding from life. I feel like I'm sort of coming back to life. \r\nAnd the way that I feel with you is -- it feels so right and so perfect, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Rafe: Except that ticking clock. ",
        "Alison: You know what? We're just going to have to make every minute count, \r\nok? Unless, you know, maybe I got through to your boss. ",

        "Rafe: I want you so much, but I'm -- it's just I'm not sure if this is fair \r\nto you. ",

        "Alison: No, no. No, no, no, please, please don't go there, ok? No. You and I \r\nboth know neither one of us meant for this to happen. I mean, I'll always care \r\nfor Jamal, but what -- what I feel for you is -- well, I mean, it's like nothing \r\nthat I have ever, ever felt or will ever feel ever again. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, don't say that. ",
        "Alison: No, but that's what I feel. ",
        "Rafe: That's what I'm talking about. That's why it's not fair to you. After \r\nI'm gone, I want you to have love in your life. ",
        "Alison: And I just want us -- I want us to concentrate on what we have right \r\nnow, ok? Because I feel like the time that we have right now is a gift for both \r\nof us. ",
        "Rafe: You're right. You're right. And I am grateful. Very grateful. I just \r\nnever want to leave you. ",
        "Alison: And I never want you to go. Ok? So, given that we only have a few \r\nweeks, what if you had one wish? Just one -- one little wish? What would you \r\nwish for? ",

        "Amy: Really? Because it feels like we're going so slow. It's freezing in this \r\ncar. Maybe we should speed it up a bit. ",
