        "Alison: And that's how we're going to \r\nfight back. So, for just a few hours, we're going to pretend that creepy forces \r\nand evil vampires, they don't exist.\r\n",
        "Rafe: They don't? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Because all I want to \r\nfeel and all I want you to think about -- I want you to think about me. I want \r\nto think about how sweet your kisses taste. And how good your hands feel on my \r\nskin. ",
        "Alison: Yep, and how the shivers run \r\nup my spine. ",
        "",
        "Tess: I am so glad you believe in me. \r\nThis means so much, Jack. It means everything. ",
        "Jack: Well, if anyone can turn a bad \r\nheart good, it's you. So, I'll start doing things your way. ",
        "Tess: Well, thank you for having faith \r\nin me. You won't be sorry. Now, let's go into the bedroom, because I really miss \r\nyou. ",
        "Jack: There's one errand I have to \r\nrun, so, you go in there and get ready and warm it up for me.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Ok. I love you. ",
        "Jack: I love you. Hey, put some music \r\non, too. You know my favorite. ",
        "Jack: I love you, Tess. Hope just one \r\nday you'll forgive me. ",
        "",
        "Joshua: So that charade in the woods \r\n-- that was just -- ",
        "Caleb: Calling out the vampires? Well, \r\nto tell the truth, I was pissed enough to go through with it. ",
        "Joshua: But you didn't follow your \r\noriginal instinct, did you? ",
        "Caleb: You would have? ",
        "Joshua: We'll never know. ",
        "Caleb: No, we won't. Actually, I have \r\nTess exactly where I want her. She thinks she -- she's changed me. That somehow, \r\nshe's warmed my cold heart.\r\n\n",
        "Josh: Then why don't you just pull \r\nLivvie out of Tess and be done with it? ",
        "Caleb: This task requires subtlety, \r\nfinesse. Tess is fragile. Her heart, unprotected. It could be easily damaged.\r\n",
        "Joshua: Are you sure it's Olivia that \r\nyou want and not Tess? ",
        "Caleb: I was born to love Olivia. \r\nShe's in my blood. Tess is just along for the ride. A means to an end. \r\n",
        "Joshua: Then perhaps I can help you, \r\nnow that I am stronger. ",
        "Caleb: Make no mistake. Just because \r\nyou're one of us now doesn't make you equal. I don't need your help. ",
        "Joshua: I'm aware of my position.\r\n",
        "Caleb: And never forget I can end this \r\nfor you at any time.\r\n\n",
        "Joshua: You have gone soft, Caleb. You \r\nthink you know me? You have no idea. And by the time you find out, it'll be way \r\ntoo late. ",
        "Elizabeth: Tell me what you want.\r\n",
        "Joshua: Is that any way to greet your \r\nnew soul mate? You're agitated. What is it? ",
        "Elizabeth: I just need some of the \r\nwater. ",
        "Joshua: There isn't any water here, \r\nand I prefer traditional feeding. Call me old-fashioned. ",
        "Elizabeth: You are not suggesting that \r\n-- ",
        "Joshua: Elizabeth, we are vampires. \r\nIt's what we do. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, God, not with you.\r\n",
        "Joshua: Oh, do you see anybody else \r\nhere in the room? Hello?\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: I hate you. ",
        "Joshua: Who cares? I'm not \r\nparticularly fond of you, either. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, don't. ",
        "Joshua: Your neck looks particularly \r\nlovely. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. No. ",
        "Joshua: Oh, please, just give in to \r\nit, Elizabeth. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. No. Oh. No. ",
        "",
        "Alison: You know what? It's gone.\r\n",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: The pit in my stomach that I \r\nhad earlier. I just -- I started kissing you and I don't know where it went, but \r\nit's gone. ",
        "Rafe: I guess we should do this a lot \r\nmore often, then, huh? ",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm, I think we should do \r\nthis as often as we can.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: You know what else I think?\r\n",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: I think maybe I should take you \r\nout for some big fancy night out. ",
        "Alison: Are you trying to impress me? \r\nYou're going to take me out on a date? ",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And I'm going to take you \r\nout for a, yeah, a big night on the town and then I'm going to tell you exactly \r\nwhat I want you to wear. ",
        "Alison: Oh, ok, we're going to do this \r\ngame. Why do I have a feeling that it's going to be something short and sexy and \r\nsomething I'm going to have to have a -- ",
        "[Alison gasps] ",
        "Rafe: I want you to wear this.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: My ring! My God, it's my ring. \r\nIt's so beautiful. ",
        "Rafe: I think it belongs back on this \r\nfinger. ",
        "Alison: I have missed this so much. \r\nYou have no idea. ",
        "Rafe: See, the thing is this ring, \r\nit's a promise. It's a promise that no matter what, no matter how bad things \r\nget, that we got a wedding to plan and we got -- we got happily ever after \r\nwaiting for us right around the corner. ",
        "Alison: I will never take this off, \r\nnever, never. Never. I promise -- never, ever. Ever. I missed it. ",
        "Alison: Oh! I have something for you. \r\nI almost forgot. I also have something for you, Rafe Kovich. Your watch again.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: My wedding gift. Thank you.\r\n",
        "[Alison giggles] ",
        "[Pounding on door] ",
        "Rafe: Whoa, whoa! Hold on! ",
        "Alison: Wait. Rafe. ",
        "[Knocking] ",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right! Who is it? \r\n",
        "Jack: It's Jack! ",
        "[Pounding] ",
        "Alison: Jack? ",
        "Rafe: Ok, Jack. Take it easy. \r\n",
        "[Knocking] ",
        "Rafe: All right. ",
        "Alison: Hey, what is it? What's wrong? \r\nIs it Tess? ",
        "Jack: I set her up. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jack: Yes. She thinks she can heal \r\nhim. And she's not going to stop, and I don't know what to do. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right, slow down. What \r\ndid you do?\r\n\n",
        "Jack: I lied to her. I told her that I \r\nbelieved that she could heal vampires. I supported the mission to save Caleb.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Jack -- \r\n",
        "Jack: What the hell was I supposed to \r\ndo, Alison? I just let her go -- go and let Caleb destroy her just like he did \r\nLivvie? He's going to destroy us. He's going to destroy us all if we don't do \r\nsomething. And I want you to know, I want to be the one that drives the stake \r\nthrough his heart. ",

        "\nTess: Oh, Jack. How could anyone ever \r\ntake you away from me? ",

        "\u00a0On the next \"Port Charles: Surrender\" -- ",
        "Alison: You're trying to keep Tess \r\npure and innocent, and Caleb wants her to be the Livvie she used to be. You guys \r\nare pulling her apart.\u00a0 ",
        "Joshua: So why don't you just give in \r\nto it? Go on. Why don't you give in to me? "
