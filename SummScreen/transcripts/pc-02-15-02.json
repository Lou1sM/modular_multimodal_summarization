        "Ricky: You know what you're doing? ",
        "Casey: Can't you tell? ",
        "Ricky: I don't mean that. You sure you want to do this here? ",
        "Casey: It's a little late for that now, don't you think? ",
        "Ricky: Well, I just thought that there's this little place kind of near here.\r\n",
        "Casey: How long do you think it's going to take to get there? ",
        "Ricky: I don't know -- five, ten minutes. ",
        "Casey: That long, huh? Well, you know what I can do in five, ten minutes? A \r\nlittle of this, a little of that. ",
        "Ricky: You know what, Case? I'll tell you, you need to stop that or -- ",
        "Casey: Or what, huh? Are we going to do it or are we just going to talk about \r\nit? ",

        "Paige: \"And then the mommy and the daddy and the beautiful little girl lived \r\nhappily ever after.\" Just the way it was meant to be. Isn't that a perfect \r\nending, Christina? I think so, too. ",
        "Kevin: Hello? Well, I guess I don't have to ask how things are going up here.\r\n",
        "Paige: Hey. Welcome home. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. It's nice to be home. ",
        "Paige: Yes. ",
        "Kevin: Hi, Christina. I missed you. ",
        "Paige: She's probably a little tired. We've been having so much fun today, \r\nhaven't we? Yes. ",
        "Kevin: Well, thanks for watching her. Lucy told me this was all your idea?\r\n",
        "Paige: Well, I thought you two needed some time alone. Speaking of which, what \r\nare you doing here? Go back. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, actually, Lucy had to go pick up Serena. She wasn't feeling well, \r\nso she went to bring her home from a slumber party. ",
        "Paige: Oh. What a shame. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, it's just a little stomach ache. She'll be fine. In the meantime, \r\nlittle one, Mommy will be home soon, but that means I get to tuck you in \r\ntonight. ",
        "Christina: No, I don't want you. ",

        "Colleen: I'm so sorry we had to page you, but Mr. Neely insisted on seeing \r\nyou. ",
        "Eve: I know, he can get a little hysterical, but he's calmer now and \r\nhopefully, he'll sleep through the night. ",
        "Colleen: Great. And at least you have some of the evening left. ",
        "Eve: Which I plan on making the very most of. In fact, my very handsome, \r\ngorgeous husband is waiting for me in the on-call room to take me out to dinner.\r\n",
        "Colleen: You have a great time. ",
        "Eve: We will. ",

        "Eve: Yeah? ",
        "Jamal: It's Gabby. We need your help, please. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. Gabby, what's wrong? ",
        "Gabriela: It's nothing. Jamal's overreacting. ",
        "Jamal: She got hit in her lower back, ok? ",
        "Eve: Whoa, whoa, whoa, she got hit? Colleen, get me a wheelchair, please. ",
        "Jamal: I -- I got in a fight with this guy the other day, and she kind of \r\njumped in between us. ",
        "Eve: You got punched, Gabby? ",
        "Gabriela: It was an accident. ",
        "Jamal: She -- ",
        "Eve: Sit. ",
        "Jamal: She said she was all right, but the pain got a lot worse, a lot worse \r\novernight. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, I also said that I would know if there was something \r\nseriously wrong. I am a nurse. ",
        "Eve: Uh-huh, and there's a reason why doctors and nurses do not treat \r\nthemselves, ok? You only have one kidney. You've got to be careful. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok, but it just -- ",
        "Eve: No, no, no, no, no. Ok, no buts. Let's get her into a room and start an \r\nexam, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Ok. ",
        "Gabriela: Fine. And then you'll see that there's nothing wrong. ",
        "[Gabriela groans] ",
        "Eve: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, that was not \r\nnothing. Hey, listen, this may be a little more serious than you think. ",

        "Ian: I got it. Ok. Sorry. ",
        "Amy: Wow. That was some greeting. ",

        "Ricky: Wait, wait, wait. What if somebody walks in here, huh? ",
        "Casey: Don't you know? Danger of getting caught is half the fun. ",
        "Ricky: You are something else, you know that, Casey? I have never met anybody \r\nlike you. ",
        "Casey: Got that right. ",
        "Ricky: So, we're really going to do this, huh? ",
        "Casey: I can't think of anything else to stop us. You do have a thingy, \r\nright? ",

        "Ricky: Oh. No way. Oh, this can't be happening, no. ",
        "Casey: Just ignore it. ",
        "Ricky: I can't. If I blow off Mrs. B., my butt is out the door and then we can \r\nkiss that necklace and our future plans goodbye. ",
        "Casey: I'd rather kiss you. ",
        "Ricky: Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. Hold on, hold on, all right? Let me just check \r\nthis. Maybe I can stall her, ok? Oh, oh, oh, oh, man, I got to get out of here, \r\nall right? ",
        "Casey: What? ",
        "Ricky: Get your clothes on. It's my sister. Something's happening to her. I \r\ngot to get to the hospital. ",

        "Eve: I'm not sure. We're going to take a look at her stats and go from there.\r\n",
        "Colleen: All the exam rooms are full, but the luxury suite's available. \r\nNobody's using it. ",
        "Eve: That's perfect, that's fine. Would you do me a favor and go to the \r\non-call room and tell Ian that I'm going to be a while? ",

        "Ian: I'm sorry. I don't know what you're implying. ",

        "Ian: No. Like I tried to explain to you, I came in here looking for Eve --\r\n",
        "Amy: Uh-huh. ",
        "Ian: Because she was supposed to meet me here, and being as dark as it is --\r\n",
        "Amy: Well, I don't usually bother with the lights when it's just me. ",
        "Ian: Ok, I know. I just -- I saw -- ",

        "Ian: The shape of a woman and I assumed it -- ",
        "Amy: You assumed? You mean you don't even know your own wife in the dark? ",
        "Ian: I know my wife in the dark. Of course I know her in the dark. I know her \r\nin the dark and out of the dark and just -- I'm saying that I -- ",

        "Ian: I made a mistake, that's all, all right? ",
        "Amy: Well, you make a lot of those, Ian. ",
        "Ian: What's that supposed to mean? ",
        "Amy: Well, how many times have you said to me, \"I'm sorry, Amy, what I did \r\nwas just a mistake?\" ",
        "Ian: Are you keeping track of my mistakes, woman? ",
        "Amy: I'm a shrink. I notice things like that. Like when you walked in on me \r\nwhen I was undressing -- a mistake. ",
        "Ian: It was. ",
        "Amy: And when we were in the car together after the accident, your hand just \r\nhappened to mistakenly, of course, wander a bit. ",

        "Ian: Perfect. Thank you. Great. ",
        "Amy: Relax, Ian. There's no harm done. ",

        "Kevin: Christina, how about I tell you a story? Would you like that? ",
        "Christina: No, I don't want you. ",
        "Paige: Ooh, sweetheart, Kevin's only trying to be nice. He wants to be your \r\nfriend. He likes you. And you know what? I think if you gave him a chance, you'd \r\nlike him, too. Do you know why I like him so much? He tells the best stories of \r\nanybody and that's not all. He makes the funniest faces and does magic tricks \r\nand he can draw a picture that looks just like you. Do you want to see that? \r\nYes? ",
        "Kevin: You would? Well, ok, why don't you just sit right there and we'll get \r\nstarted. ",
        "Christina: Paige sits, too? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, of course, honey. Paige loves to have her picture painted. ",
        "Paige: Especially by such a wonderful artist. Ok, let's move. There we go. \r\nHow's that? ",
        "Kevin: That's perfect. Boy, do you two make a pretty picture. ",
        "Paige: Why, thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, just hold that pose. ",

        "Paige: Yeah, I know. ",
        "Kevin: Here, why don't you give it to me? I'll put it away. ",

        "Kevin: Unless there's some reason you don't want me to. ",
        "Paige: It's not that I don't want you to take it. It's just that it has a \r\nsentimental value for me. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I wasn't going to hock it. I was just going to put it out of \r\nreach. She seems pretty determined to get it from you. ",
        "Paige: Well, I mean, maybe she's just a bit restless. I mean, you know kids \r\nand sitting still. Would you like to take a short break? Yes. ",
        "Kevin: Well, what do you think, Christina? You want to play with your toys?\r\n",
        "Christina: Watch. ",
        "Paige: Yes, sweetie, that's right, that's my watch. You know what? We forgot \r\nall about your juice box over there. Look, you want some? It's right over there. \r\nThere you go. ",
        "Kevin: I don't think I've ever seen her so taken with something before. ",
        "Paige: It's just a watch. I'm sure she's forgotten all about it. ",
        "Christina: Watch. ",
        "Kevin: You were saying? ",
        "Paige: She just heard us talking about it. ",
        "Kevin: Nonetheless, maybe I should just go ahead and take it. I mean, lest we \r\ntempt her. I'll be careful, I promise. Look. ",
        "Paige: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: It's right there, safe and sound. ",
        "Paige: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: No, thank you. I'm really grateful for the way you've been helping out \r\nwith Christina. ",
        "Paige: Oh, it's nothing. ",
        "Kevin: Nothing? Paige, that's the first semi-breakthrough I've had with her. \r\nYou've really got a way with kids. ",
        "Paige: Well, I love them. ",
        "Kevin: You'd make a wonderful mother. ",
        "Paige: I'm afraid it's a bit too late for that. ",
        "Kevin: No, that's not true. Look at Lucy -- she adopted Christina, she's \r\nnever been happier. So, maybe someday -- ",
        "Paige: I could have a little goddess like her. ",
        "Kevin: Why not? ",
        "Paige: Well, yes, why not? I mean, I guess miracles do happen. I believe \r\nthat. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I know they do. And when it does, you'll make an incredible mom.\r\n",
        "Paige: Thank you. That means so much coming from you. It means everything.\r\n",
        "Paige: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: Uh-oh. Looks like someone's about ready to conk out. ",
        "Paige: Oh. Well, why don't you let me put her to bed? ",
        "Kevin: That's a good idea. ",
        "Paige: Yes. ",
        "Kevin: I guess we can pick up the painting tomorrow. ",
        "Paige: Oh, we'd like that, wouldn't we, Christina? Yes, we would, but now \r\nit's off to bed. ",

        "Eve: Hey, hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions, ok? ",
        "Ricky: Ok, so, meaning that it's not so bad, she's going to be all right? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. I am concerned that she may have seriously bruised or \r\ninflamed her one remaing kidney. ",
        "Ricky: You know, that's just great, huh? It wasn't enough that you made her \r\ndonate that kidney to that bastard kid of yours, but now you got to trash the \r\none she's got left? ",

        "Amy: Well, it hasn't been hard. Oh, what the hell, Ian. Maybe we should just \r\ngo for it and get it over with. ",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? ",
        "Amy: I am talking about one really hot, wet, juicy kiss, just to get it out \r\nof our systems. And we will probably find out we're not missing anything at all. \r\nSo what do you think? Are you game? ",
