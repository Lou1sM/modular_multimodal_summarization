        "Ian and Lucy confront Kevin about harassing them and violating the restraining order, but Kevin informs them that he was sitting far enough away until they approached him. Frustrated, Lucy and Ian leave the restaurant. Caleb sits down at the bar and is annoyed to learn that Kevin is just a few seats away. Kevin accuses Caleb of either losing his touch or giving up on Livvie, because she was supposed to be back by now. He thinks the vampire is now obsessed with Tess instead. Kevin also believes that Caleb has fooled himself into believing that he's in control while knowing deep down that it isn't true. Meanwhile, Livvie lets Jack know that she's back. He notices the music box and quickly closes the lid, which brings Tess back with a jolt. Confused, she remembers her intention to play the music, but Jack stops her before she can do it again. He talks her into getting rid of the music box because of the bad memories he associates with it. She trusts him to return it to Caleb, but instead he takes a hammer to it and throws it away. Ian thinks it may not be Lucy's status as a slayer that helps him. Instead, he believes it's the fact that she allows him to love her. Elizabeth reads Ian's notes and realizes that there may be a way for her to be normal again. Without revealing what she knows, she tries to get Ian to tell her how he manages to stay in control without feeding or drinking the special water. Jealous and territorial, Lucy orders her to stay away from Ian, claiming that she's taking care of him just fine. Realizing that making love with a slayer may be the answer, Elizabeth places a call to Rafe. While Jack and Tess are inside, the music begins to play from inside the garbage can."

        "Caleb: I've had better.",
        "Kevin: Valentine's day must be hell for those of your ilk.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, I don't see you surrounded by a whole lot of love. I guess that's what restraining orders will do to you.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, touch\u00e9. So, then, what do two lonely men do?",
        "Caleb: Tonight, nothing.",
        "Kevin: Actually, I have a subject we haven't touched on in a while -- my daughter Livvie. Come on, you promised to bring her back, but so far all I see is Tess. What's the matter, Caleb? Losing your touch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Caleb's music plays]",
        "Jack: I'm home.",
        "Livvie: Jack.",
        "Jack: Tess, what's going on?",
        "Livvie: Now, what do you mean, \"what's going on\"? What does it look like? Why don't you come dance with me for old time's sake.",
        "Jack: Old time's sake?",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, stop pretending you don't remember.",
        "Jack: Livvie?",
        "Livvie: You miss me, babe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: So Ian's a vampire and Lucy's a slayer. But according to this little notation, their lovemaking made Ian better. This -- this could mean that there's a cure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You should have let me deal with him.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, right. Then he wins, and you get in a lot of trouble. No, I shouldn't have.",
        "Ian: I meant what I said. If he hurts you again, I'm going to kill him.",
        "Lucy: I know. I just -- I don't believe that's what he wants to do right now. I think part of his plan is just messing up my life.",
        "Ian: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry you have to be involved in any of this.",
        "Ian: I know.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ian: If that's him, you're not stopping me this time.",
        "Lucy: No --",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Ian, I'm so glad you're home.",
        "Ian: What are you doing here?",
        "Elizabeth: I've just been really worried about you. You haven't been by to pick up water in such a long time.",
        "Ian: I have plenty of water left.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, you're certainly stronger than I am. I haven't been drinking very much myself, and I'm ready to jump out of my skin. You -- you haven't been feeding on anyone, have you?",
        "Ian: No, don't be ridiculous. What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: He is absolutely fine.",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sure you've heard that I've left Stephen.",
        "Lucy: What do you want here, Elizabeth, really?",
        "Elizabeth: It's just lonely. You know, Ian's one of the few people that can actually understand what I'm going through.",
        "Lucy: Oh, gosh. You know, to me, the reason he could possibly understand that is because you're the one who turned him into a vampire.",
        "Ian: Lucy, it's all right.",
        "Lucy: No, it's not all right. You know what? You should take responsibility for what you did. What, you come over here and ask, after you put that curse on him, how he's doing? I'll tell you how he's doing. He's been going through sheer hell. Does that answer your question?",
        "Ian: What's the matter? Why are you so upset? What's going on?",
        "Elizabeth: It's just it was just one of those days that I'm feeling rather helpless, and I guess it was pointless to be worried about you because you -- you look very good.",
        "Lucy: I have been helping him out. I've been taking care of him, ok?",
        "Elizabeth: You're taking care of him? A slayer and a vampire?",
        "Lucy: Yes, that's right.",
        "Ian: I'm fighting it, the same way you should be fighting it until we come up with something else.",
        "Elizabeth: Are you sure there isn't anything else --",
        "Ian: I'm sure. I'll let you know if something comes up, ok?",
        "Elizabeth: Or maybe there is something you're just not telling me.",
        "Lucy: Would you leave him one?",
        "Ian: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: He does not owe you anything. Well --",
        "Elizabeth: Ian, thank you. Listen, could you and I just go somewhere and talk?",
        "Ian: No. I don't know. I don't think so.",
        "Elizabeth: Please, I just -- I really need a friend right now, and you've been so good to me under the circumstances, and it's just -- things are just getting really desperate.",
        "Ian: Ok, that's enough. That's enough.",
        "Lucy: Get away from him and keep your horny hands to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Stephen Clay?",
        "Second woman: Oh, my God, it is you.",
        "First woman: Can we have your autograph?",
        "Second woman: And take our picture with you?",
        "Caleb: Would a kiss do instead?",
        "Woman: Oh, my God.",
        "second woman: Oh, my God.",
        "First woman: Oh, my God.",
        "Second woman: Oh, my God.",
        "Kevin: Well, you do have a way with the ladies, I'll give you that.",
        "Caleb: They always love the bad boys. But you should know that by now.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I guess some of them do.",
        "Caleb: Your daughter did.",
        "Kevin: But we're not here to argue Livvie's strengths and weaknesses, are we? The fact that she chose to be with you breaks my heart, but there it is.",
        "Caleb: Giving up?",
        "Kevin: Me? Never. But I think you are.",
        "Caleb: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Kevin: She's sweet, isn't she? Tess. Oh. Oh, yeah you think you have it all mapped out, all your ducks in a row, and then she hits you with those innocent brown eyes and you just get lost. I think Tess gets you. I know she challenges you. I mean, she's not like those other girls who think the sun rises and sets on you. And that makes you want to get to her even more, doesn't it?",
        "Caleb: What, you're going to shrink me now, Doc, tell me what's wrong with me up here?",
        "Kevin: Psych 101. It's called obsession.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Caleb's music plays]",
        "Livvie: What's the matter, Jack? You do not look happy to see me.",
        "Jack: How did you get here?",
        "Livvie: Isn't the better question \"what are you going to do about it\"?",
        "Jack: Where's Tess?",
        "Livvie: Here where I've been, and where she'll stay.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Livvie: Caleb wants me, Jack. He's calling me. Can you hear it? I'm coming for you, my darling.",
        "Jack: The music box.",
        "[Caleb's music stops]",
        "Tess: Jack?",
        "Jack: Tess.",
        "Tess: Hi. You're home.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm home.",
        "Tess: What -- what happened? I -- I think I was about to --",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, no! Don't open it, don't open it.",
        "Jack: Tess, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Tess: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Jack: Nothing. How'd you get this?",
        "Tess: Stephen gave it to me.",
        "Jack: Right, that's what I thought.",
        "Tess: He said it belonged to Livvie. Is there something wrong with it?",
        "Jack: Tess, Caleb uses the music box to make Livvie do bad things.",
        "Tess: Yeah, and Stephen gave it to me because he said that he doesn't need it anymore, he's not going to go after Livvie, and I should know that.",
        "Jack: Did he tell you that?",
        "Tess: Jack, don't worry. It's not going to make me do a bad things. He opened it for me, I listened to it, and it didn't affect me at all.",
        "Jack: Right. Tess, can I ask you a favor?",
        "Tess: Of course you can.",
        "Jack: Can I get rid of it?",
        "Tess: Why?",
        "Jack: Well, it just -- you know, it kind of brings back bad memories, and I just really don't want it in the house.",
        "Tess: Yeah, I'll give it back to Stephen --",
        "Jack: No, no, no, I'll take care of it myself. Ok?",
        "Tess: Ok. Jack? Is there something you're not telling me?",
        "Jack: No. No, sweetie. It's just that -- you know, it's the memories, that's all. I'll just feel better once it's gone.",
        "Tess: Ok.",
        "Jack: Ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: All right, let's do this. It'll be fun.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Usually, the first tell tale sign is denial.",
        "Caleb: Ooh. Thrill me some more.",
        "Kevin: You once told me, not that long ago, that my ego was a distraction, that it was more important to me not to lose to you than to get what I really wanted.",
        "Caleb: I was right.",
        "Kevin: The thing is you're doing the same thing.",
        "Caleb: So now who's projecting?",
        "Kevin: The challenge, the resistance is the fact that you're not able to manipulate Tess -- that must be excruciating to someone like you. I mean, especially someone who's used to women falling all over themselves just to experience your magic. But not Tess. She resists. And, boy, does that piss you off.",
        "Caleb: So let me get this straight -- you're saying now that Tess is the one I'm obsessed with. That's your \"diagnosis.\"",
        "Kevin: You tell me.",
        "Caleb: You can't read me. You can't know what I'm going to do or how I'm going to do it. I don't operate like anyone you've ever known before.",
        "Kevin: Is that so?",
        "Caleb: I've experienced more passion in one moment in my life than you'll experience in an entire run of yours.",
        "Kevin: And pain, too?",
        "Caleb: Well, that's the beauty of it. In my world, there's intensity and power without all the anxiety and helplessness and guilt that rules your world. Once you've had what I have, you could never settle for anything less.",
        "Kevin: But when you get down to it, none of that really matters, does it? Because whether it's Tess or it's Livvie, you're obsessed with the love of a woman to the point of forgetting almost everything else.",
        "Caleb: Your psychobabble bores me, Doc.",
        "Kevin: Oh, now, come on, Caleb. The longer you live among us, the more like us you become. You're becoming human.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Excuse me, you want me to get my what?",
        "Lucy: No, no, let me correct you. I said keep your horny hands to yourself.",
        "Ian: Ok --",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset anyone.",
        "Ian: Well, you should go home.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ian: Come on, out. Hello?",
        "Lucy: Good, you didn't leave yet. I just wanted to say a few words to you.",
        "Elizabeth: Why are you so threatened by me?",
        "Lucy: You can't really be serious.",
        "Elizabeth: You know what we are. You know that we have certain desires that can only be satisfied by our own kind -- at least that's what I've always been led to believe.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, maybe. Well, you know what? I need to know. Did you really just think you were going to drop over and have, what, a little bite, maybe little feeding, a little dinner, a little sex? Is that it?",
        "Elizabeth: You can't possibly satisfy him.",
        "Lucy: That is none of your business. But what's my business is taking care of him. And what you have done is so abhorrent and selfish. What were you thinking? Elizabeth, were you that lonely and that hungry to put this curse on such a wonderful, generous, incredible man, and ask him to live like this? What were you thinking?",
        "Elizabeth: You have no idea what it's like.",
        "Lucy: Oh, and you have no idea that it's like for me to watch him. And now you're coming over here, what, to do more damage? To suck life out of him? Is that it?",
        "Elizabeth: He wanted me. He was enjoying himself. You only interrupted.",
        "Lucy: That is enough. What I interrupted was I wanted to stop him from feeding so he wouldn't become like you, and obviously you've developed a taste for feeding, haven't you?",
        "Elizabeth: So it's true. It's true, he doesn't feed. He doesn't drink the water. He relies only on you.",
        "Lucy: Yes, that's right.",
        "Elizabeth: So tell me how that's possible.",
        "Lucy: I would like to tell you many --",
        "Ian: Everything ok out here?",
        "Lucy and Elizabeth: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: I was just wishing Elizabeth a swell evening.",
        "Elizabeth: I'm so sorry that I interrupted you. I can't tell you how happy I am to see that you're better. Good-bye",
        "Lucy: Ta.",
        "Ian: \"Horny hands,\" is it?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you know -- oh, that was embarrassing. I don't think I've ever been quite so inarticulate. It was just a stupid thing to say.",
        "Ian: Hey, try to be compassionate. She doesn't have anybody. I have you. I'm grateful.",
        "Lucy: I know. I -- oh, you're right. You're absolutely right. I am sorry I got so upset.",
        "Elizabeth: Can't believe there's actually a way out of this. I can actually go back to being normal. All I have to do is sleep with a vampire slayer. Hi, Rafe. It's Elizabeth, your mother-in-law.",
        "Lucy: Ok, so, tonight we had Kevin and Elizabeth. So I'd say that just about ends the old Valentine's day feeling, huh?",
        "Ian: No, because they're not here now. It's just you and me.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you're right. Ok, so, no more talk about stripping leprechauns or Kevin or Elizabeth.",
        "Ian: You know, you don't only make me feel better, you make my whole life better. I didn't think I could feel this way again.",
        "Lucy: Me, too.",
        "Ian: Yeah?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Ian: I still think I owe you.",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah. No, you owe me big time. But I think I owe you a lot, and maybe part of it's just putting up with me.",
        "Ian: That's right, I do that, don't I?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Wait, no, you're not supposed to agree with me. You're not going anywhere, are you?",
        "Ian: No. I'd put up with all the craziness in the world if I could spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "Lucy: I don't see how things could get much crazier.",
        "Ian: With a vampire and a slayer?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. But you know, that is not what we are to each other -- not really. Not deep down inside here, right?",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Lucy: But I am glad I'm a slayer, because if being a slayer and making love to you makes you feel better, helps you, I'm glad I can do it. But you know, I've been thinking about that. Maybe it's not just my slayer-esque stuff. Maybe it's my sparkling personality.",
        "Ian: Really?",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Lucy: Maybe I have some sort of calming effect on you.",
        "Ian: Calming -- sure, calming effect.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, or maybe it's just some sort of aura that I put out.",
        "Ian: Aura?",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ian: No, I have my own theory.",
        "Lucy: You do? Really? What is it?",
        "Ian: I think you make me feel this way because you allow me to love you. And there isn't a feeling in the world that can hold a candle to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: There's nothing wrong with being human, Caleb. I mean, there's more of us than there are of you.",
        "Caleb: Once again, you reach for the obvious.",
        "Kevin: You're such a good liar. You've convinced yourself that everything's still under your control. But they're not. And deep down inside, you know it. I'll send you my bill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: It's late, Jack. Why don't you come to bed?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I'll be there in a minute.",
        "Tess: You're hurting. I can feel it.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Tess: Makes me hurt, too.",
        "Jack: I'm fine now, now that I have you in my arms.",
        "Tess: Everything's going to be ok.",
        "Jack: Do you know that you're the most beautiful, wonderful person in the world? When I look at you, it's hard to believe there's something wrong.",
        "Tess: I love you.",
        "Jack: I love you, too.",
        "[Caleb's music plays]",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Elizabeth: Rafe's a slayer, and I'm just certain that he's the only one that has what I need.",
        "Rafe: So let's see it. The music box, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Rafe: Because, you see, whoever controls that box controls the next time Livvie makes an appearance."
