        "Ricky: Just get out of here, Casey. This is between me and Jamal. ",
        "Casey: No way. Ok? I am not letting you mess up everything we planned. ",
        "Ricky: Look, all I got to worry about is what I got to do right now, all \r\nright? So back off. ",
        "Casey: Oh, whoa, whoa, ok. So, what, you kill Jamal? Huh? And then what? You \r\ngo back to jail and this time it's for good. ",
        "Ricky: I don't care about what happens to me. That bastard keeps risking my \r\nsister's life, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. ",
        "Casey: Ok, so, I'm with you. All right? Look, you can't let him get away with \r\nit, all right? There's got to be some serious payback. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah. So why are you trying to stop me? ",
        "Casey: Because you can't be stupid about it. Look, everyone saw you go off on \r\nJamal. If you're going to go after him, you got to plan it when no one can tie \r\nit to you. Right? ",
        "Ricky: You know, every time I think I got you figured out -- ",
        "Casey: More surprises. That's how life should be, right? ",
        "Ricky: Right. ",
        "Casey: Look, just forget about that jerk -- for now. Ok? Just take care of \r\nyour sister. ",
        "Ricky: All right. ",
        "Casey: Let me take care of Jamal. ",

        "Paige: I'm so sorry. Christina kept asking for one more bedtime -- story. Kev? \r\nHuh. Must've gone downstairs. \"Paige, I got called away.\" That's odd. Why didn't \r\nhe come downstairs and tell me he was leaving? Or mention where he was going?\r\n",
        "Paige: I never should have let him take this off me. But there's no way he \r\ncould've seen underneath. Or is there? ",

        "Ian: Hey, Bob. How you doing? ",
        "Bob: Hey, Ian. ",
        "Ian: Where's Victor? ",
        "Bob: He's not working. He's supposed to, but he decided to take the night \r\noff. ",
        "Ian: All right. I'll go get him at home. Thanks. Hey. ",
        "Kevin: Ian. ",
        "Ian: How are you feeling? ",
        "Kevin: You know what? I feel good. I guess I have you to thank for that. ",
        "Ian: You would've done the same for me, right? ",
        "Kevin: Well, thank you. You saved my life. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: I thought Victor was working tonight. ",
        "Ian: No, he's not. He's not here. I was already looking for him. ",
        "Kevin: Something wrong? ",
        "Ian: I wanted to talk to him about that watch you found in the woods. ",
        "Kevin: I think I know what happened to that. ",
        "Ian: How do you know Amy has it? ",
        "Kevin: Amy? I saw Paige with it. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Kevin: I think we need to have a talk. ",

        "Kevin: I had just started to paint Christina and Paige, but Christina kept \r\nfiddling with Paige's watch. ",
        "Ian: And that's when you got a look at it. ",
        "Kevin: No. She wouldn't let me near it. ",
        "Ian: That figures. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I finally convinced her to let me take a look at it. Turns out \r\nit had a fake cover on it. ",
        "Ian: As did Amy's. ",
        "Kevin: Does she know you saw it? ",
        "Ian: No. She ran out before I got a good look. I couldn't ask her about it. \r\nSo there are two strange watches? ",
        "Kevin: Owned by two women who pretend they've never met before. ",
        "Ian: But they obviously have. They just don't want anyone else to know about \r\nit. ",
        "Kevin: And they both have fake covers on their watches? ",
        "Ian: And Amy was panicking when her watch was setting off Victor's machine.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. The ground where that light hit New Year's Eve did the \r\nsame thing. ",
        "Ian: New Year's -- right, yes. ",
        "Kevin: That's the same day Paige and Amy came to town. ",
        "Ian: It's getting very bizarre. ",
        "",
        "Paige: You snap your fingers and I'm supposed to be here, but, oh, I'm in \r\ntrouble and you're nowhere to be found. ",
        "Amy: For your information, I was in a car accident with Ian. ",
        "Paige: Oh -- I'm sorry, Amy. I didn't know -- ",
        "Amy: Forget it. I've got even a bigger problem. ",
        "Paige: Your watch face is up. How long has it been like that? ",
        "Amy: How am I supposed to know? I'm blind, remember? ",
        "Paige: Were you just with Ian? ",
        "Amy: Yes, but -- ",
        "Paige: Well, he could've seen it. ",
        "Amy: Ian's a direct guy. He would've confronted me. It must've happened after \r\nI left. ",
        "Paige: You have got to be more careful. ",
        "Amy: I know. I've got to rein things in. That's why I called you. ",
        "Paige: I'm sorry, I'm just -- we're both a bit on edge. I had a close call \r\nwith my watch, as well. ",
        "Amy: What? How? ",
        "Paige: Kevin took it off me while he was painting me. ",
        "Amy: What? ",
        "Paige: I couldn't stop him. ",
        "Amy: Did he see it? ",
        "Paige: No. I mean, he may have glanced at it while I was out of the room, but \r\nhe couldn't have known there was anything underneath the face. ",
        "Amy: We both do need to be more careful. ",
        "Paige: So what do you mean you have to rein things in? What's happened with \r\nIan? ",
        "Amy: I've been trying to keep things under control, but he just keeps messing \r\nit up. ",
        "Paige: Why? What did he do? ",
        "Amy: Nothing. Everything. I don't know. ",
        "Paige: Amy, what's going on? ",
        "Amy: He has just been wonderful, that's all. ",
        "Paige: And that's a problem because? ",
        "Amy: We're getting too close. ",
        "Paige: So back off. ",
        "Amy: You should've seen how amazing he was with me when we were both stranded \r\nin the car. ",
        "Paige: What happened? ",
        "Amy: He got his leg caught under the dash, and he couldn't drive us out of \r\nthere. So I did. ",
        "Paige: You drove? ",
        "Amy: And Ian steered the car. ",
        "Paige: Wow. ",
        "Amy: And he -- he had his arms around me. And -- ",
        "Paige: And what? ",
        "Amy: It's not -- it's not supposed to be like this. It's not supposed to be \r\nlike this with him. ",
        "Paige: What do you mean it's not supposed to be like this? I thought you said \r\nyou didn't know Ian before you came here. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I know Paige. It's been a long time, but I still know her. Now all of \r\na sudden she has this watch made of God knows what and a connection to a woman \r\nthat she pretended not to know? ",
        "Ian: Every time I think I'm getting to know Amy better, it turns out I don't \r\nknow her at all. ",
        "Kevin: They've both been lying since the day they came here. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Wonder what else they lied about. ",
        "Kevin: Paige wasn't upfront at first about why she showed up, but she's since \r\nadmitted everything. And then there was that thing with her skin. ",
        "Ian: What, with her skin? What? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy went on this jag because she couldn't understand why Paige looked \r\nso young. So she got a skin sample. ",
        "Ian: A skin sample? You're kidding me. ",
        "Kevin: It's a long story. The point is Paige's skin literally hasn't aged.\r\n",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Kevin: It was skin grafts from an accident that she was in. ",
        "Ian: That's what Paige told you? ",
        "Kevin: Well, it made sense at the time. ",
        "Ian: None of this makes any sense anymore. ",
        "Kevin: You're right. ",
        "Ian: We got -- what is this -- scorched earth, funny watches? Now we got \r\nageless skin. Come on. ",
        "Kevin: What are you thinking? Come on, Ian, what? ",
        "Ian: I will deny it if you quote me on this, but what if Victor is right? \r\nWhat if these two women are -- ",
        "Kevin: Extraterrestrials? ",
        "Ian: We've seen crazier things. ",
        "Kevin: No. No. Ian, Paige is the woman that I knew all that time ago. ",
        "Ian: And her skin hasn't aged in 20 years? ",
        "Kevin: Well, she's still Paige. ",
        "Ian: Or someone pretending to be her. ",
        "Kevin: No. No, that's not possible. ",
        "Ian: Anything is possible, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: No. No. I've talked to her, I've spent time with her. Ian, she knows \r\ndetails about my life that no one else would know. ",
        "Ian: Details about your life that no one else would know -- wasn't it the \r\nargument with Anne-Marie, as well? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, it was. But I -- I still can't believe that Paige is an imposter. \r\nAll right. Let's just assume for a moment that she is. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. And she came to Port Charles to see you. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. What about Amy? What's her connection to you? ",
        "Ian: I -- I don't know. I've never met her before in my life. ",
        "Kevin: You sure about that? ",
        "Ian: I'd remember Amy. ",
        "Kevin: Ian, you've been all over the world, you've known a lot of women. ",
        "Ian: What do you say we leave the past where it is and try to figure this \r\nout? ",
        "Kevin: Good idea. ",
        "Ian: Now, I have a question for you. What if -- what if when those two women \r\ndisappeared, they were -- ",
        "Kevin: They were together? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. And what if they had something between them from the very \r\nbeginning? ",
        "Kevin: The question is, what? ",
        "",
        "Amy: I only meant that being back on earth wasn't what I was expecting. ",
        "Paige: Huh. Because it sounded like you were talking about Ian. ",
        "Amy: I never met Ian when I was alive and that's the truth. I just wish I \r\nhad. ",
        "Paige: I think we all wish we could have the lives we're meant for. ",
        "Amy: What does he look like? ",
        "Paige: What? ",
        "Amy: Ian. What does he look like? ",
        "Paige: Well, he's handsome, in a rugged sort of way. He has short brown hair \r\nand a 5:00 shadow that's always creeping in. ",
        "Amy: But his eyes are like a little boy's, aren't they? Just bursting with \r\ndetermination. I have to stop this. I have a reason to be here and that doesn't \r\ninclude caring about Ian Thornhart. ",
        "Paige: Then just stay away from him and -- and -- you know what? Sometimes \r\nyou just have to give in to your feelings. ",
        "Amy: Yeah. I guess it's not working out so well with Kevin, is it? I mean, \r\nyour trying to stay away from him? ",
        "Paige: You know, I was, I wanted to. I told him I was leaving, and he \r\nwouldn't let me. ",
        "Amy: He wouldn't let you? Come on, Paige. ",
        "Paige: Honestly. I mean, he kept saying he needed me to stay. ",
        "Amy: And so you just decided to stay in his life? ",
        "Paige: Honestly, Amy, it's innocent this time. I mean, painting me is really \r\nreawakening something in him. ",
        "Amy: And for you. ",
        "Paige: I'm not going to lie. I'm having the best time watching him paint me \r\nand playing with his adorable little stepdaughter. ",
        "Amy: Just don't forget there's a mama bear in this Goldilocks story. ",
        "Paige: I know. You don't have to remind me. ",
        "Amy: Ok. ",
        "Paige: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I'm a little tense from everything \r\nthat's happened. Honestly, I'm fine now. I'm just -- I'm just worried about you.\r\n",
        "Amy: I'll be fine. I just needed to let off a little steam. I better get back \r\nto the hospital. ",
        "Paige: And I want to go home. ",

        "Karen: Your remaining kidney has been compromised. ",
        "Ricky: \"Compromised?\" What does that mean? ",
        "Karen: Well, Eve and I aren't sure of the damage yet, but we still need to \r\nrun more tests. ",
        "Gabriela: In the meantime? ",
        "Karen: In the meantime, I'm putting you on dialysis. ",
        "Gabriela: No. ",
        "Karen: Gabby -- ",
        "Gabriela: No. ",
        "Karen: It's just to take the pressure off your kidney. It's just a \r\nprecaution. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, if you need me to donate a kidney, I'll do whatever it takes. If \r\nyou need me to donate blood or whatever, just -- whatever will make it better.\r\n",
        "Karen: I'll keep that in mind. But for now, let's just wait and see what the \r\nrest of the tests say, ok? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. Thanks, Karen. ",
        "Karen: Yeah. ",

        "Jamal: Gabby, this never would've happened if it wasn't for me. I swear you'd \r\nbe better off if you never even found out we were related. ",
        "Gabriela: That's not true. If we hadn't found out, we wouldn't have been able \r\nto save your daughter's life. And we wouldn't be in each other's. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but I swear, I'd do anything to change this. Anything. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok, here's the deal -- there's no more being down about this, \r\neither of you, because I'm going to get through this. That's all there is to it.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Yeah, of course you are, Gigi. ",

        "Gabriela: Well, actually, I would like to have my rosary. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, all right. I know the one you're talking about. Do you still \r\nkeep it in that jewelry box by your bed? ",

        "Ian: Hmm. I'm done guessing. I'm going to ask her point-blank. ",
        "Kevin: No. No. That's not a good idea. ",

        "Ian: Ok, you're right. No confrontations. So what do we do? ",

        "Ian: You did? ",
        "Kevin: The watch vibrated and then it moved to the number six. ",
        "Ian: Six? Victor said it moved from 13 to 12 before someone stole it. ",

        "Kevin: Well, then it's -- it's a weekly calendar, but why 13? ",
        "Ian: Amy said she's leaving in six weeks. Six and seven -- that's 13. ",
        "Kevin: So the watch is marking the weeks -- from the time Amy and Paige got \r\nhere? ",
        "Ian: Until the time that Amy's planning on leaving. I bet something's going \r\nto happen when the watch hits 13. ",
