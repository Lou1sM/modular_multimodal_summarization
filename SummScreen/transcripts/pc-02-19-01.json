        "Lucy: Possible? ",
        "Doctor: What was the date of your last period? ",
        "Lucy: My -- oh, oh, oh -- oh, that would prove something, right? I mean, you \r\nknow, sometimes when you're nauseated or just tired it could be, like, a flu \r\nvirus or something, right? And so -- I have a calendar. I can look right here \r\nand it'll tell me because I always write -- December, right before Christmas.\r\n",
        "Doctor: Well, that was almost two months ago. ",
        "Lucy: So? ",
        "Doctor: Well, have you been active during that period of time? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Doc! ",
        "Doctor: Yes? ",

        "Ian: This, all of it. ",
        "Arianna: But we're married. ",
        "Ian: Not the point. ",
        "Arianna: No. The point is you're in pain, and I want to help. Can't you let \r\nme? ",
        "Ian: What makes you think I need help with anything? ",
        "Arianna: I saw you before with Eve, kissing. I made sure Ben didn't see, but \r\n-- it's got to be so hard, not being able to be with the woman you love because \r\nof me. Look, I owe you everything. ",
        "Ian: You -- you don't owe me a flipping thing. All I want is for you to live \r\nyour life the way you deserve it. That's it. ",
        "Arianna: If we succeed. ",
        "Ian: We will succeed. And you will have everything that you've ever dreamed \r\nof, I promise you. You're a beautiful, desirable woman, and one day you'll fall \r\nin love with a man, and he'll love you back. And it'll be great for both of you. \r\nAnd he will be a lucky, lucky man indeed. Ok? Do you understand me? ",

        "Ian: The beaches -- ",
        "Eve: Go on forever. I'm just assuming. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. There's a rainbow out on the horizon almost every day and a \r\nrainbow of tropical fish just below the surface of the water. And the islanders \r\nthemselves are the kindest, most gentle souls. I remember how my heart flooded \r\nwith the most peaceful feeling I'd ever known when I set foot on that island. \r\nBecause I knew I'd finally come home. I'd come home to where I'd always \r\nbelonged. ",

        "Frank: Dr. Wexler? ",
        "Karen: Frank. Hi. ",
        "Frank: Bad time? ",
        "Karen: Well, it depends on the patient, what the emergency is. ",
        "Frank: Well, I'm the patient, and my symptoms are an out-of-control desire to \r\nask you out on an incredibly romantic date, and only you can cure me. ",
        "Karen: Well, consider yourself as good as healed. When would you like to \r\nschedule this procedure? ",
        "Frank: You busy after this shift? ",
        "Karen: I am now. Care to define \"incredibly romantic?\" ",
        "Frank: I could open the floor to suggestions, gain some insight into the kind \r\nof night that gets you all warm and fuzzy. ",
        "Karen: Ok, um -- moonlight skating on Vincent's Pond followed by a fireplace \r\nand cocoa? ",
        "Frank: Ice is a little thin after all the sun last week. ",
        "Karen: Candlelight dinner at Mario's? ",
        "Frank: How about a couple of dimly lit hours in my garage? ",
        "Karen: Be still, my heart. ",
        "Frank: It's just that I am this close to figuring out why that old computer \r\nalmost blew up on us. ",
        "Karen: Wow. You, me, and an ancient computer making funny noises. Well, \r\nthat's a recipe for amour. ",
        "Frank: We don't need a fancy restaurant to help set the mood. ",
        "Karen: No, but Mario's does make a killer -- ",
        "Frank: Spaghetti and lobster. ",
        "Karen: My favorite. ",
        "Frank: It just so happens that I have the recipe to Mario's special spaghetti \r\nand lobster. I can whip us up a batch. We could rent the perfect \r\nsnuggle-on-the-couch movie -- ",
        "Karen: Which, in your opinion, is? ",
        "Frank: \"Houseboat?\" ",
        "Karen: With Cary Grant and Sophia Loren? That's my favorite. ",
        "Frank: I know. ",
        "Karen: How? ",
        "Frank: Getting to know more about you has become my new favorite hobby. ",
        "Karen: You mean second favorite, next to fixing that computer. ",
        "Frank: Uh-uh, uh-uh. Number one. No competition -- not even close. ",

        "Kevin: Lucy, what -- what are you doing here? ",
        "Lucy: I'm always here. You know, I'm always here. There's always hospital \r\nbusiness that needs to get done. ",
        "Kevin: Not at this hour there isn't. ",
        "Lucy: Um, well, I also had to make an appointment. I want to get a checkup \r\nfrom top to bottom, and that's why I'm here -- to make that appointment. No \r\nsecret agendas, no secrets anywhere, nothing up my sleeve, no big deal. ",
        "Kevin: No big deal? Really? I know you well enough to know that whatever put \r\nthat look in your eye is no question a big deal. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, you want to know what put this look in my eye? I'll tell you. ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",

        "Kevin: Thanks to me? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, thanks to you. And now the ending to a perfect day -- the perfect \r\nending is I come -- never mind. I'm leaving now, so if you'll excuse me. Step \r\naside. ",
        "Doctor: Oh, good. You're still here. I'm glad I caught you before you left \r\nthe hospital. I'd like to run some tests. ",
        "Kevin: Tests? ",

        "Lucy: Look, Dr. Palumbo, Dr. -- You know -- ",

        "Karen: Spaghetti and lobster. ",
        "Frank: And a few more favors I've ferreted out. Take care, Rhonda. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, you too, Joe. ",
        "Frank: It's Frank. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah. Sorry. My brain's on hold. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, lucky your daughter's a great doctor. Bye. ",
        "Karen: Bye. He's cute, isn't he? ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Karen: And he was just kidding. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah. He's got a great sense of humor. Hey, I was wondering if \r\nyou wanted to have dinner. ",
        "Karen: Tonight? ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, well -- ",
        "Karen: How about tomorrow or maybe next week? ",
        "Rhonda: Well, I suppose that would be all right, but you know, I feel like we \r\nshould really get together and talk. Is the date important? ",
        "Karen: Well, it's not that it's important. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, then what is it? ",
        "Karen: I just feel a little funny canceling it without a good reason. ",
        "Rhonda: I see. ",
        "Karen: Mom -- ",
        "Rhonda: No, no. It's your own life. You know, suit yourself. ",
        "Karen: Yes, it is, and when we get together next week, I'll tell you all \r\nabout it. Oh, come on. I don't know why you're acting this way. ",
        "Rhonda: I don't know what you mean by \"this way.\" ",
        "Karen: Well, something's bothering you. ",
        "Rhonda: All right, since you're twisting my arm. Don't you think it's a \r\nlittle strange, you know, seeing so much of Frank? Don't you think it's a little \r\nbit -- ",
        "Karen: A bit what? ",
        "Rhonda: Well, it just seems a little strange, you know. I mean, seeing one \r\nbrother when you were engaged to Joe, the other? ",
        "Karen: Well, you know, Joe doesn't have a problem with it, or Frank. ",
        "Rhonda: Ok. You want to hear what really concerns me? ",
        "Karen: No, but I'm sure you'll tell me. ",
        "Rhonda: Frank is an addict, ok? He has a history of abuse. ",
        "Karen: Mom, Frank was given drugs, ok? He didn't choose to get hooked on \r\nthem. And besides, he's been clean for years. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, well, you haven't, all right? And I happen to know, honey, that \r\nthe number one rule of recovery is that you do not get into a serious \r\nrelationship for a year, especially someone with a history, honey. ",
        "Karen: Well, I can't exactly cut out all the addicts in my life, can I? Since \r\nyou're at the top of that list. ",
        "Rhonda: Is that how you thank me for being concerned? ",
        "Karen: Look, I'm sorry. That just came out the wrong way. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, it always does. Just like your choices. ",
        "Karen: Wait a minute. ",
        "Rhonda: So if this is what you really mean, you know, and you really like \r\nFrank, I would think long and hard about all the mistakes you've made with men \r\nbefore you go blindly rushing into the next one, Karen. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I am the one that should be embarrassed, not you. I kissed you for all \r\nthe wrong reasons. ",
        "Arianna: Ian, stop. ",
        "Ian: But I promise it'll never happen again. ",
        "Arianna: No, please. I understand. ",
        "Ian: Perfect. So if we can put this behind us -- ",
        "Arianna: We already have. ",
        "Ian: I promised I'd take care of you. And if anything ever got in the way of \r\nthat, I don't think I could live with myself. ",
        "Arianna: I was worried you may be thinking badly of me because of what Ben \r\nsaid. ",
        "Ian: Ben said -- what, about you having a baby? ",
        "Arianna: You have to believe me -- I never said anything to Ben about us \r\nhaving a family. I would never suggest such a thing, not to anyone. ",
        "Ian: No, of course not. ",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry he mentioned it in front of Eve. ",
        "Ian: Ah, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter anyway. It's not like you \r\nwere going to have a baby. Arianna, what? ",
        "Arianna: He said -- ",
        "Ian: He said what? ",
        "Arianna: They'd never accept our marriage unless I had your baby. ",
        "Ian: Son of a -- ",
        "Arianna: I know that's not possible and that will never happen, but Ben only \r\nwants what he wants, and it frightens me. And unless I get pregnant, he'll never \r\ngo away, and his threats will go on and on and it will never stop! Never! ",

        "Kevin: Answer me, Lucy. Lucy, don't make me pull it out of you. ",
        "Lucy: All right, Doc, you want me to tell you what's wrong with me? I'll tell \r\nyou. I'm pregnant. That's what's wrong with me. Are you happy now? I am \r\npregnant, and it's your child. ",
        "Kevin: My child? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, your child. After all these years, it's finally happened -- after \r\nall these years of praying and dreaming and hoping for it to be true. For so \r\nlong I've been hoping. It finally came true. It's happened -- I am pregnant, \r\ndespite everything. Despite losing Christina, despite all those awful \r\nmiscarriages. It's -- it's like a miracle. It is a miracle for me. But this \r\nisn't exactly the way it was supposed to happen. You're not supposed to hate me \r\nlike you do. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, Lucy. I don't hate you. ",
        "Lucy: Really? That's not what it sounded like. I heard you, Doc, loud and \r\nclear when you told me that being with me was just, like, some kind of big \r\nroller coaster ride. You told me, \"Get out of my life, Lucy.\" Well, guess what \r\n-- the tables are turned, Doc, because you're right back in the front car of the \r\nbiggest roller coaster in the world. You're in that front car, and you're in for \r\nthe biggest damn ride of your life, and so I want to know what you're going to \r\ndo about it. You tell me. What are you going to do about it, or better yet, what \r\nam I supposed to do about this? Tell me. Answer me! ",
        "Kevin: Answer me, Lucy. Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Kevin: Come on! Don't make me pull it out of you. ",

        "Frank: Hey. I was hoping you'd still be around. ",
        "Karen: Frank. ",
        "Frank: Look, I know I might not have sounded that way before, but I promised \r\nyou a real romantic evening and that's what we'll have, ok? Only first, I would \r\nlike to start by giving you a peek at the computer. I've made some real progress \r\non it. I'm kind of excited, and I'd like to show it off. ",
        "Karen: You know what? It sounds great -- it really does, but -- ",
        "Frank: But? ",
        "Karen: I'm sorry, I just found out a little while ago I won't be able to make \r\nit after all tonight. ",
        "Frank: They put you on an extra shift, huh? ",
        "Karen: I wish I could've said no, but -- ",
        "Frank: Oh, hey, no sweat. That happens to me all the time. I understand. \r\nWe'll just reschedule for later in the week? ",
        "Karen: Ok, great. Well, you know, they're jumbling schedules right now, but \r\nas soon as the dust settles, I will let you know, ok? But thanks for asking. ",
        "Frank: Karen -- ",

        "Lucy: Well, you know, Doc, it hasn't been that easy to talk to you lately.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I know. But you also know how important it is to be honest when a \r\nfriend looks you in the eye. ",
        "Lucy: And you know how much I want to be. I try very hard. It's just \r\nsometimes certain things sort of get in the way. ",
        "Kevin: I don't believe it! There you go again! I ask you a simple question \r\nand you do the same old song and dance -- doing whatever you can to make sure \r\nthat nobody blames you for whatever goes wrong in your little universe. ",
        "Lucy: And there you go again attacking me! Boy, talk about a roller coaster. \r\nI'm not a roller -- if I'm a roller coaster, then you're a big, fat loop-de-loop \r\ngoing around. You know, sometimes you see me and you are so mean and so hateful, \r\nand then you look at me right now and you're being so sweet and all concerned \r\nlike you might be really worried I was sick.

        "Kevin: Yes! ",
        "Lucy: Well, forget it. You know what? Don't be. Take that concern back, ok? \r\nBecause I'm fine. I just -- I had a bump on the head. I fell, and I came here to \r\nthe hospital. You know how the staff is about head trauma. They're worried about \r\nthe bumps. They were going to do a few more tests. That's all there is -- just a \r\nbump, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Well, why didn't you just say so? Why do you have to make such a drama \r\nout of everything? ",
        "Lucy: A -- me a -- do you know why? Because I got this bump on my head from \r\nyour wife when she pushed me into the wall of-- a bathroom wall! Do you \r\nhear me? She pushed me, and we were having a conversation about you, and I don't \r\nwant to have them anymore. I'm done. I'm sick and tired of them. I'm sick of \r\ntalking about you. I'm sick of talking about her, so just go. I want you to \r\nleave. Walk away. Just walk away because nothing's going on -- nada, zilch, \r\nzippo. Ok? Good-bye. Leave me alone! ",
        "Kevin: If that's what you want. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, that is definitely what I want. ",
        "Kevin: Then that's what you get. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, kid, listen. If this is the way it's going to be, I guess, you \r\nknow, it's just going to be you and me, alone. Alone. ",

        "Eve: I don't understand. ",
        "Ian: The islanders say that if two people are meant to be together, that \r\nmeans they've been together through the ages. When I went to the island for the \r\nfirst time, I knew that I'd been there before. And when I saw you, I knew you'd \r\nbeen there with me. You'll feel it, too, when you go there. ",
        "Eve: So if we're together now and we were together then -- ",
