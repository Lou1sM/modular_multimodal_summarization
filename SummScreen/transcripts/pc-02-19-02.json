        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Livvie: Hi. How's Gabby? ",
        "Jamal: She's doing all right, I guess, so far. I just gave some blood. ",
        "Livvie: Jamal, you're not here alone, are you? I mean, what about Alison? ",
        "Jamal: What about her? ",
        "Livvie: You did go and see her after we saw you last, didn't you? ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, look, I know you're trying to help, but it's over between me \r\nand Ali. Ok, there's nothing left between us, so why even try? ",
        "Jack: Because you love her. ",
        "Livvie: Wait, wait, so you're saying you never went over to see her? ",
        "Jamal: I just told you I didn't go to see her. God. ",
        "Livvie: You never went after I gave you the directions to her grandmother's?\r\n",
        "Jamal: No. ",
        "Livvie: You didn't go? Jack, no one's heard from her or seen her in days. ",
        "Jack: Look, you don't think something's wrong, do you? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not sure. ",
        "Jamal: What do you mean, you're not sure? ",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm just saying the longer she goes without checking in, the \r\nmore afraid I get that Ali might be in some kind of trouble. ",

        "Rafe: Oh, no, you don't. ",
        "Alison: Yes, I do! ",
        "Rafe: No. ",
        "Alison: Listen to me. Dinner is on me. It's my treat. ",
        "Rafe: I am the one who said let's go grab a bite, so I'm -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know, but it isn't -- ",
        "Rafe: Going to -- ",
        "Alison: What? What? ",
        "Rafe: My wallet. I think I left it in the car. ",
        "Alison: Oh, sure. ",
        "Rafe: I did. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: Look, go in. Just don't order without me, ok? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Ok. What? ",
        "Rafe: I'm just wondering how I got so lucky. ",
        "Bartender: Alison, hey. ",
        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Bartender: Grab a table. Jamal right behind you? ",
        "Alison: No, no. He's -- he must be busy tonight. ",
        "Bartender: Bike shop business, huh? One menu coming right up. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, one, thanks. No rush or anything. ",
        "Rafe: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Rafe: Sorry. It was in the car. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Rafe: So what did I miss? ",
        "Alison: Nothing. Nothing. ",
        "Rafe: You know what? I missed you. ",
        "Alison: Yeah? Rafe -- don't. ",
        "Rafe: What? What? What's wrong? ",
        "Alison: I can't -- I can't do this anymore. ",

        "Casey: Ricky? Where are you, man? If you can hear me -- do you hear me? I cut \r\nthe brakes! I cut the brakes! No! ",

        "Ricky: \"No, Ricky, no,\" what? ",
        "Casey: How did you stop? ",
        "Ricky: These things come with brakes. How do you think I stopped? ",
        "Casey: Yeah, but I cut the line. ",
        "Ricky: What are you trying to do? Huh? You trying to kill me? ",
        "Casey: No! Jamal, dumbo. Look, it's his bike, right? Look, how was I supposed \r\nto know? You wanted some payback because of Jamal and his fight club thing and \r\nhim messing up with your sister's kidney. And then him thinking that he can talk \r\nto you backhand? No way. ",
        "Ricky: You tried to whack him for me? ",
        "Casey: For us. ",
        "Ricky: Let me give you a little advice. If you want to cause some damage, try \r\ncutting the brake line, not the speedometer. Just a suggestion. ",
        "Casey: Oh, God. It doesn't matter, as long as you're ok. All right? As long \r\nas you're not the one, Ricky. ",
        "Ricky: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is that, \"the one?\" ",
        "",
        "Colleen: Knock, knock. You awake, Gabby? ",
        "Gabriela: Yes. Colleen, hi. Come in. Sit down, please. ",
        "Colleen: Oh, I wish I could. You any better tonight? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, a lot better than yesterday, but not 100% though. Hey, are \r\nyou sure you can't stay? I mean, I know you're shorthanded, and it's just that \r\nboth of my brothers disappeared on me and it's been quite a year so far, not \r\nthat last year was a picnic or anything like that, but -- ",
        "Colleen: Well, I have a feeling that this year's going to be better if you're \r\nup for visitors because there's someone waiting to see you. ",
        "Gabriela: Really? Who is it? ",
        "Joe: It's just me. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, my God. J-- Joe. ",
        "Joe: How you doing, Gabby? You -- you look great. ",
        "Gabriela: Joe, I can't believe it. You're here. ",

        "Rafe: What is it? What happened? ",
        "Alison: Nothing. Nothing. ",
        "Rafe: What? Did I do something? Did I say something? What happened? What? ",
        "Alison: No. No, no, no, no. ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: No, no, it's not you. It's not. It's just -- it's just this place, \r\nyou know? I have just spent so much time here. There's so many memories here.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Jamal, right? ",
        "Alison: See, Rafe, when you and I are together, it's perfect and sort of our \r\nown little perfect world and -- ",
        "Rafe: Right, and now we're back in the real world. ",
        "Alison: It's just really uncomfortable, that's all, you know? And I go in \r\nthere and people, like, ask if we're still together, and -- and I don't know. I \r\njust don't want to get into it, and -- and I just want to be glad for us, you \r\nknow, for you and for me. God, I really want you to know that, ok? ",
        "Rafe: It's ok, angel. I understand, all right? ",
        "Alison: So, then, it's ok, then? The no P.S.A.? ",
        "Rafe: No what? ",
        "Alison: Public signs of affection. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. ",
        "Alison: You know, just not here, not right now. ",
        "Rafe: Right, right, right, no, no, it's ok, yeah. You know, I guess I got so \r\nwrapped up in this and in us, I just forgot what it would look like to the rest \r\nof the world and, you know, us being back here now. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. We have sort of been wrapped up in our own little world for the \r\nlast few days. ",
        "Rafe: I can't keep you locked up in a barn forever, though. ",
        "Alison: If I was with you, I could live in a barn and be really happy. It's \r\njust, you know, I sort of wish -- ",
        "Rafe: That there were someplace without farm equipment that we could maybe \r\nhang out, spend some time? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, maybe just a place where things weren't popping up \r\nand reminding us of -- ",
        "Rafe: Things. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: There is. ",
        "Alison: Where? ",
        "Rafe: Well, as long as you're comfortable with it, you could maybe move in \r\nwith me at Lucy's house. ",
        "Alison: Lucy's. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know, she's letting me stay there, and I'm sure she wouldn't \r\nmind if you moved in. And, you know, it's private and it's quiet and really \r\nquite beautiful. ",
        "Alison: No, it sounds perfect. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. So? ",
        "Alison: So, if you're asking me to move in with you, my answer's yes. Yes, I \r\nwill move in with you. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, good. Then, let's get going. ",
        "Alison: Wait. Right now? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I just -- you know, I can't wait to pick you up and just carry \r\nyou through the door and over the threshold. Are you ok, Alison? Is there a \r\nproblem? ",
        "Alison: No, no. No. There's no problem. It's just before I go through that \r\ndoor with you, I really need to close another door first. ",

        "Jack: Anything? ",
        "Livvie: No. She's not at her grandmother's. ",
        "Jamal: Well, did you check our place? Maybe she went back there for some \r\nclothes. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, I did. I checked there. She's not there, either, and I tried \r\nher cell phone. It's on, but she's not picking up. It just keeps ringing and \r\nringing. ",
        "Jamal: That's not like her. She always has to know who it is. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I have a really bad feeling that something's wrong. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, look, she hasn't been missing that long, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said anything about Alison being missing? ",
        "Livvie: I do. She's either missing or hiding. I don't know. Jamal, why didn't \r\nyou go and see her? ",
        "Jamal: Because I knew it wouldn't make any difference, Livvie. ",
        "Jack: Come on, man, that's bull. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, he's right. Ali didn't deserve what he did. So maybe she's \r\nout there somewhere all alone hurting. And if something happens to her, you are \r\nresponsible, Jamal. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, Livvie, stop, all right? ",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, no, Jack. She's right. I should have gone and talked to \r\nher. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you bet you should have. ",
        "Jamal: Fine, Livvie. Fine. I made another bad call. ",
        "Jack: All right, easy, stop, all right? ",
        "Jamal: I'm on a roll now. ",
        "Jack: Quit blaming yourself for things you didn't do. What matters is now.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok. You're right, you're right. Look, don't worry, I'm going to \r\ntrack her down, all right? ",
        "Livvie: How, Jamal? Where? ",
        "Jack: Hey, we'll all look. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you guys double-check here and the park and I'll check the \r\nrecovery room and our apartment, ok? ",
        "Livvie: All right, let's go. ",
        "Jack: My cell's on. ",

        "Joe: Shh. So how are you feeling? ",
        "Gabriela: I'm ok. I've been better, though. How are things at the clinic? ",
        "Joe: Great. Great. Rural. ",
        "Gabriela: But I guess it's home now, right? ",
        "Joe: Yeah, yeah, I guess, sort of. But Port Charles is always going to be my \r\nreal home. There are people here I care a lot about. ",
        "Gabriela: I guess Frank and your mother were happy to see you. ",
        "Joe: Well, I haven't really seen them yet. ",

        "Casey: Dude, get a grip. ",
        "Ricky: Hey. Look at me. All right? You threw yourself at me, talking like you \r\nhad some advance word on me checking out. ",

        "Casey: Look, there's nothing to spill, ok? Look, man, you're wasting my life. \r\nYou know, why don't we just concentrate on figuring what our next shot is at the \r\nnecklace. ",
        "Ricky: No. Forget it. The job is off. ",
        "Casey: Wait. Since when? ",
        "Ricky: Since you started playing games and holding back on me. ",
        "Casey: Oh, man, why don't you just be quiet about that. Who knows what it \r\nmeans, whatever you think I said. ",

        "Rafe: Yeah. So how's it going out here? ",
        "Alison: Good. Actually, when I left, I left in such a hurry that I didn't \r\nrealize that I left so much stuff behind. I'll just pack a few more things and \r\nthen I'll be gone for good. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know what? Before it gets too late -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
