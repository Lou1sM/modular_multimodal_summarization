        "Ian believes that he's found a cure, but the only way to know is to test it out on himself. Despite her initial protests, Lucy gives in and agrees to let him inject himself with the serum. Within seconds of the injection, Ian's symptoms return, and Lucy is unable to help. He turns violent, and she pulls out a knife for protection. They struggle for control of the knife, and Ian begs her to kill him, but she refuses. Lucy eventually manages to calm him down, and he reverts to normal. Alison is stunned by what \"Tess\" says to her until she realizes that it really isn't Tess at all. When Jack closes the music box, Tess returns, sending Livvie back inside. Jack sends Alison to get Rafe. He shields Tess from the truth about what what really happens during her memory lapses. Convinced that having sex with a slayer will cure her, Elizabeth makes every effort to seduce Rafe. He thinks this is crazy, but Elizabeth pushes him down on the bed and climbs on top of him. Alison arrives just in time, and she's furious to see what her mother is up to. Elizabeth tries to explain, but Rafe insists that it wouldn't have worked. Alison is tired the way her mother makes everything out to be about herself. Walking out of the room with Rafe, she fills him in on what happened at Jack's after he left. She goes back inside to talk to her mother, who's ashamed of herself. As long as there's hope that Alison will forgive her someday, she can handle it. Jack promises to hide the music box from Tess. She doesn't ever want to open it again unless Jack is there with her. She's thrilled to receive the rag doll he bought her, which is identical to the one she had when he found her. She promises that they'll soon have a baby of their own. Rafe tells Jack that it's time to put their plan into action."

        "Livvie: Always hanging around, always trying to make trouble.",
        "Alison: Why are you so --",
        "Livvie: \"Why?\" Wake up! Use the two brain cells you have left -- if you've even got two. I happen to hate you, remember?",

        "Livvie: \"Wrong\"? No, no, nothing is wrong. In fact, everything is finally right again. You're the one who doesn't recognize someone you used to call your so-called best friend once upon a time.",

        "Jack: I don't know, but tell me how that got here.",
        "Alison: I don't know. She came in and she was carrying that. But as soon as she opened it, like, I don't know, something started to happen.",
        "Jack: Caleb gave Tess the music box.",
        "Alison: Oh, God.",
        "Jack: Yes, and then I destroyed it, and suddenly it came back together. I don't know.",
        "Alison: Yeah, just like Caleb.",
        "Jack: So, Alison, now do you know what we're dealing with?",
        "Alison: Yes, I understand. And anything that you need -- I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Ok, just get Rafe back here, and I'll take care of Tess. I'll make sure she stays busy.",

        "Jack: The what?",
        "Tess: The music, and then the next thing I know, I was standing there and she was looking at me really upset, and then you were standing there --",

        "Lucy: No. Absolutely no.",

        "Ian: I know what will happen if Idon't take it.",
        "Lucy: But I know we're fine. That water's making you hold steady, and making love to me stops the urges enough to --",
        "Ian: Well, I don't want that. I don't want to make love to you to stop urges. I -- I'm -- I don't want to turn something beautiful into a prescription.",
        "Lucy: You haven't, you won't, and it's not. I love making love with you, more than anything --",

        "Lucy: Ok, but --",
        "Ian: And I want to make love with you because we want to, not because we have to. Try to understand that, please.",

        "Rafe: This is a joke, right? I mean, it's a really bad joke.",
        "Elizabeth: Listen to me.",
        "Rafe: I mean, it's, like, a nightmare bad joke.",

        "Elizabeth: Saving someone's soul.",
        "Rafe: I am -- mine.",
        "Elizabeth: No, Rafe, look, I know -- I know you love Alison --",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I do.",
        "Elizabeth: And she loves you so much, and she's happy, and I want her to stay that way.",
        "Rafe: Ok, then, you know what? What you're doing doesn't make any sense at all.",
        "Elizabeth: No, I know exactly what I'm doing. You just don't understand.",
        "Rafe: I don't understand what? What?",
        "Elizabeth: You don't understand what happens when a vampire sleeps with a slayer.",
        "Rafe: Ok, what? What happens?",
        "Elizabeth: All the symptoms disappear.",
        "Rafe: They what?",
        "Elizabeth: The hunger and the cravings --",
        "Rafe: What -- this is crazy. Who told you that?",
        "Elizabeth: No, listen --",
        "Rafe: That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Elizabeth: Rafe, you're the only one that can help me. You can do two things. You can kill me, or you can have sex with me.",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth --",
        "Elizabeth: No.",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth --",
        "Alison: Mother, I went to -- mother! Rafe!",
        "Rafe: Hey, Alison.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, listen, I can explain this.",
        "Alison: Yeah, please do explain.",
        "Elizabeth: It is not what it looks like.",
        "Alison: Really? Why don't you give me your version of what you think it looks like.",
        "Rafe: See, here's the thing. Somehow your mother got this crazy idea that if she had sex with a slayer, all her vampire symptoms would be cured.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Elizabeth: It's true. No, it's true. I have proof. If a vampire makes love with a slayer, all of your symptoms vanish.",
        "Alison: Do you know anything about this?",
        "Rafe: No, it's news to me.",
        "Elizabeth: No, but, listen, you know how desperate I was. My God, Alison, I tried to kill myself. I can't handle this anymore. And when I found that out, I just needed Rafe -- he was just here. I was just trying to get him to help cure me!",
        "Alison: Mother, shut up! God! Rafe, I'm so sorry. I thought that maybe my mother needed your help. I didn't know she needed your --",
        "Elizabeth: I did! I do! I know, it's unusual.",
        "Alison: Oh, my -- \"unusual\"? Yeah, it's a little unusual. It's sick! You're embarrassing yourself!",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, it's my last hope. It's my only hope. It was going to change everything.",
        "Alison: Right -- for you. Of course. It's always about you. You, you, you. You need hope. This is your last thing. This is all about you. I'm so sick of that. You asked me to bring over the man that I love, the man of my life, and little did I know you had this planned all along?",
        "Elizabeth: No! No, Alison.",
        "Rafe: Ok, that's enough.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. I'm not finished yet.",
        "Rafe: Yes, you are. Elizabeth, you didn't mean it, did you?",
        "Elizabeth: No. Baby, I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: All right, come on.",
        "Elizabeth: You don't understand.",
        "Alison: Oh, right.",
        "Rafe: You know what you need to do? Keep just gulping that water of yours because this other crazy idea of yours, it was never going to help you, it was never an option, all right?",
        "Elizabeth: You guys, wait. Please, you don't understand. All I -- please. I'm begging you. Don't leave, please. I'm so sorry. Just don't leave, ok? Don't leave.",

        "Tess: You know that box was right next to the bed when I woke up this morning. I mean, who else could have put there while I was sleeping?",
        "Jack: Yeah. You really don't know, do you?",
        "Tess: No.",
        "Jack: Tess, when you opened that music box --",
        "Tess: Something strange happens, something I can't remember?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Tess: Like -- it's like a dream. I'm asleep, and a part of me is still awake in a dark corner somewhere, but the other part of me wakes up and then it feels like -- Jack, what happens when I open this music box? Why can't I remember?",
        "Jack: It probably reminds you of bad memories. See, Livvie had a music box just like this, and she felt really strong about it, too.",
        "Tess: Livvie.",
        "Jack: And I know how close you and Livvie were, anyway, so I guess I had no right to try to get rid of the music box.",
        "Tess: That's all right. Jack, you were trying to help me, to keep me from hearing the music that makes me forget, that makes --",
        "Jack: So maybe -- hey, Tess, maybe I'll just keep it.",
        "Tess: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Ok?",
        "Tess: Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. You take it because I really love it and I want it, but now that I remember, the song -- there's something about it that isn't right, Jack.",
        "Jack: Promise me that you will not open this unless i'm with you.",
        "Tess: I promise. Please, just hide it from me, please. I won't ever open it, not alone, I promise. I promise, Jack, please --",
        "Jack: Hey --",
        "Tess: Please, just hold me.",
        "Jack: Ok, I'm going to hold you.",
        "Tess: Just hold me, hold me.",

        "Lucy: Ok. So far so -- good. No. No. Are you ok? Is -- what is it? Uh -- do you want me to get you something? What can I do? Ian, what do you want me to do for you right at this -- oh! Oh! Ok. Ok, why don't I go get you your water. Let me get your water -- oh! Ian, listen to me. Let me make you feel better, ok? Let me make you feel better. Let me make you feel better. I can do that, you know? Let me make you feel better. Uh -- Ian. Ian -- no!",

        "Elizabeth: Alison, I've lost everything -- my marriage, my family, my future. I don't -- I have absolutely no future, no hope, no help. Everything is right there in that bottle. That's all that I have. I can drink that, and it'll just keep me alive, one tortured day after another after another. That's how it's going to continue to be for me. It's never going to change!",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "Rafe: Wait, you know what? You're wrong about that, though.",
        "Elizabeth: What?",
        "Rafe: Well, there is a way. We have to kill Caleb, and then you go back to normal.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, but that doesn't have anything -- it's never going to happen. That's impossible.",
        "Alison: Oh, mother, please --",
        "Elizabeth: And even if it does, you know, it doesn't even -- oh, it's not going to save me, anyway. It just -- oh, my God, I'm just starting to lose my mind!",

        "Alison: Caleb is everywhere. He's everywhere. I mean, look what he's already done to my mother. She tries to seduce you just so she can get free? Give me a break. And after you left Jack's house, Tess comes out with some music box. She starts listening to it, to the music. And guess who pops out of her.",

You have to fight for us, for the future we can have together and for what we might be. Listen to me -- Ian, fight for Danny! Your son needs you. He needs you so much. You have to fight for him.

You don't destroy the people you love. Ian, please, this isn't you. Come back to me the way you are. You told me that we have a future together. You said that, and I believed that because I believe in you. Oh! I believe in you. You will not hurt me. Ian -- oh, my God. You have to keep fighting this. That's the way.
