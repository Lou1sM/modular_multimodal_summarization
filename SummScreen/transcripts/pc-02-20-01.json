        "Alison: These colors are going to look so good in here. ",
        "Jamal: You know, I still think plain old white. ",
        "Alison: Oh, God, that's so boring. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, it is a bike shop. ",
        "Alison: No, Jamal, it's not -- it's not just a bike shop. It's a -- it's a \r\nvery hip, very cool, very Jamal bike shop. ",
        "Jamal: All right, all right. All right, why not? Why not? Let's splash some \r\ncolor around. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, totally. Come on. ",
        "[Jamal mimics Alison] ",
        "Alison: Hey! Yeah, this is going to look so -- ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, whoa! ",
        "Alison: What? What? ",
        "Jamal: Stop, stop! I didn't mean literally splash it around. Let me show you.\r\n",
        "Alison: No, I think I can know how to paint, all right? Just -- ",
        "Jamal: Uh-huh. ",
        "Alison: Hey, what? ",
        "Jamal: Look. Nice, even strokes. ",
        "Alison: Oh, God, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Ok? ",
        "Alison: If we do it that way, we're going to be here until the next \r\nmillennium. ",
        "Jamal: Ali -- ",
        "Alison: What? Look, why don't you just let me do it my way, all right, and \r\nyou can do it your way. I'm so -- I'm sorry. I -- ",
        "Jamal: Oh-ho-ho-ho. ",
        "Alison: I so didn't mean to do that. ",
        "Jamal: Oh-ho-ho. ",
        "Alison: Don't. Don't! ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah, \"don't, don't.\" ",
        "Alison: Hey, no! Don't do it! ",
        "Jamal: \"I'm so sorry.\" ",
        "Alison: I'm serious! ",
        "Jamal: I so didn't mean this. ",
        "Alison: Don't! ",
        "Jamal: I'm sorry, baby. I am so sorry. ",
        "Alison: You're going to get it. Oh! Don't! Stop! I'm serious! Hey! Don't! ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Alison: Wait! Time-out, time-out! ",
        "Jamal: There's no time-out in a paint fight! ",
        "Alison: Hey, it could be a customer! ",
        "Jamal: I doubt it. But I'll let you off this time. ",
        "[Ring] ",
        "Jamal: All right? I'm going to go wash up. ",
        "Alison: Time. Hey! Bike shop. This is Alison. ",
        "Gabriela: Hi, Alison. It's Gabriela. ",
        "Alison: Gabby, hi. How did you know I was here? ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, Frank told me. Actually, I was looking for Jamal. ",
        "Alison: Oh, well, he's a little bit busy. Can I take a message? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. There's a patient here in the ER, a Travis Williams, and he \r\nkeeps mentioning Jamal. ",
        "Alison: Travis Williams? Who's that? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know. All I know is he was involved in that warehouse \r\nshooting last night. ",
        "Alison: Warehouse shooting? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, you didn't hear about it? It took place during a robbery \r\nattempt. ",
        "Alison: No, no, I didn't hear that. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh. Ok, well, I just thought Jamal should know about this guy who's \r\nasking for him. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, um, I'll -- I'll give him the message, thanks. Bye. ",
        "Jamal: All right, no more fooling around. Let's get back to work. ",
        "Alison: Um, Jamal, do you know anything about a warehouse robbery last night?\r\n",
        "Jamal: I heard something about it. Why? ",
        "Alison: Because there was a guy who was shot and he's asking for you. ",

        "Eve's Voice: I wish I could share your island with you. ",
        "Ian: You have. ",
        "Eve: I've never been there. ",
        "Ian: Yes, you have. You just don't remember. ",
        "Eve: I don't understand. ",
        "Ian: The islanders say that if two people are meant to be together, that \r\nmeans they've been together through the ages. When I went to the island for the \r\nfirst time, I knew that I'd been there before. And when I saw you, I knew you'd \r\nbeen there with me. You'll feel it, too, when you go there. ",
        "Eve: So if we're together now and we were together then -- ",
        "Ian: Means we'll be together for eternity. ",
        "Eve: Take me to the island sometime in this lifetime, please, Ian. ",
        "Ian: There is nothing I'd like more than to spend forever on Tirama Island \r\nwith you. ",
        "[Whimpering] ",
        "Eve: Hello? Are you all right? Ah! Oh! Ok. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: Gabriela? ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, Arianna, what's up? ",
        "Arianna: Hey, I'm looking for Ian. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, he called and said he wasn't coming in today. ",
        "Arianna: Oh, no. I was afraid of that. ",
        "Gabriela: Of what? What happened? ",
        "Arianna: I followed your advice and I told him about Ben's threat, how he \r\nsaid he wouldn't believe our marriage was real unless -- ",
        "Gabriela: Unless you and Ian had a baby. ",
        "Arianna: I have never seen him so angry. He just stormed out. I'm afraid of \r\nwhat he might do. ",
        "Gabriela: Ian's bark is a lot worse than his bite. ",
        "Arianna: You think so? ",
        "Gabriela: I know so. He wouldn't do anything foolish. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Morning. ",
        "Ben: What the hell are you doing here? ",
        "Ian: There's a few things we need to go over. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, I'm calling security. ",
        "Ian: Wouldn't do that if I were you. ",
        "Alison: Why is this Travis guy asking for you and how do you know him? ",
        "Jamal: He's just some guy I used to hang with. ",
        "Alison: Why don't I believe you? ",
        "Jamal: I don't know. Why don't you? ",
        "Alison: Maybe it's because of that look you gave me when I mentioned the \r\nrobbery. ",
        "Jamal: What look? ",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal, a robbery happened last night -- the same last night as \r\nyour new mysterious job. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, you trying to say something, just say it. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Your new job -- did it take place in the warehouse? Oh, that \r\nanswers that question. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, it's not what you think. ",
        "Alison: It's what I think? Jamal, you don't want to know what I'm thinking! \r\nWho is Travis Williams? ",
        "Jamal: He was one of Cedric's pals. ",
        "Alison: Cedric? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, he and a couple of the guys were working a number last night.\r\n",
        "Alison: And were you one of those other guys? ",
        "Jamal: They just asked me to drive. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Travis just sold me a line, ok? He said they were just moving \r\ngoods from one spot to the next, that's it. There wasn't supposed to be any \r\ntrouble. ",
        "Alison: I can't believe this. You drove the getaway car? ",
        "Jamal: I said they asked me to, Ali. I didn't do it. ",
        "Alison: You didn't? ",
        "Jamal: No. I mean, I thought about it. Hell, I did a lot more than think \r\nabout it. I got halfway there and just -- ",
        "Alison: And then what? ",
        "Jamal: I just walked away. ",
        "[Alison sighs] ",
        "Alison: So then you weren't involved in this at all? ",
        "Jamal: No, I was long gone before anything went down. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. I don't -- I don't know whether I'm supposed to hug you \r\nright now or hit you! God. ",
        "Jamal: Do I get a vote in that? ",
        "Alison: No, you don't. Why would you ever even consider doing something like \r\nthat? Why? ",
        "Jamal: Because of you. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Let me go. Let me go! ",
        "Man: Release her. I'm sorry they frightened you. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, well, I've had warmer greetings in my time. ",
        "Man: My guards meant no harm. It's just that no one's allowed in here. ",
        "Eve: I'm sorry to have disturbed you. I heard a child crying. ",
        "Man: The child is asleep now. There's no cause for concern. ",
        "Eve: Good. He sounded like he was in a lot of pain. ",
        "Man: We don't get many visitors here on the island. May I ask, what brings \r\nyou? ",
        "Eve: A friend told me about this place. He said that it was the most \r\nbeautiful place on earth. And from what I've seen so far, it is. ",
        "Man: Did this friend come with you? ",
        "Eve: No. But he is here in a certain way. I mean, in a way, he described this \r\nplace so perfectly -- the oceans and the beaches. He was a little off on the \r\npeople, though. ",
        "Man: How so? ",
        "Eve: Well, he said that they were very -- friendly. ",
        "Man: My guards make you nervous. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, big burly guys tend to do that. ",
        "Man: Leave us. ",
        "Eve: That wasn't necessary because I'm going to go. ",
        "Man: Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay. ",
        "Eve: Thank you. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. ",

        "Ben: Easy, Dr. Thornhart. Now, there's no reason for violence. ",
        "Ian: Sit down. ",
        "Ben: Well, if you don't mind, I'd prefer -- ",
        "Ian: I said sit down! That's better. ",
        "Ben: Can I just say one thing? ",
        "Ian: Sure. A condemned man's got a right to a few words. ",
        "Ben: I'm afraid there's been a big misunderstanding. Ok, I -- I know what's \r\ngoing on here and I -- there's no reason to have the gun out right now. If you \r\njust put this away, we can talk calmly, rationally, like gentlemen. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. ",
        "Ben: I was very upset yesterday. I should not have said those things to Dr. \r\nLambert. But I didn't mean them. ",
        "Ian: Is that right? ",
        "Ben: I would never hurt her. So there's no need for any of this right now.\r\n",
        "Ian: No, there is a need for it. Because now you know what it feels like to \r\nfear for your life, just like your -- just like your lovely sister. Or did you \r\nnot mean what you said to her, either? ",
        "Ben: Listen, with Arianna, ok, that's my responsibility. That's my family. \r\nYou have no right -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know all about your family and your honor. Let me tell you this \r\n-- putting a bullet in you, Mr. Shapour, might just be the most honorable thing \r\nI'll do all day. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Could you please explain to me how I made you almost take part in an \r\narmed robbery? ",
        "Jamal: It wasn't supposed to be armed. ",
        "Alison: Oh, ok, that makes me feel a ton better. ",
        "Jamal: Look, it started when I overheard you and Frank talking about you \r\nneeding some money, ok, and how you couldn't go to your family for help. ",
        "Alison: That was because -- ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, no, no, I know you couldn't go to them because of me. I know \r\nthat. And I know how much you've given up and how much you've sacrificed. Baby, \r\nI just wanted to give something back to you. You know, just like a little \r\nsurprise for Valentine's. You know, but I couldn't. And with all those dead-end \r\njobs, I couldn't even afford rent. ",
        "Alison: So then you found another way. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, the easy way. Two grand for 10 minutes' work. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, didn't you even, like, stop to think about the danger in this? \r\nThe fact that you could land yourself back in jail? ",
        "Jamal: Travis said it was cool. I mean, there was going to be nobody getting \r\nhurt. ",
        "Alison: And you believed him? What's the matter with you? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I believed that getting that bank for you was more important \r\nthan anything. ",
        "Alison: So then what happened? What made you change your mind? ",
        "Jamal: Hey. That was you again. I realized that no amount of money was worth \r\nseeing even a second of disappointment in your eyes. ",
        "Alison: Hmm. That is probably the best Valentine's gift I've ever gotten in \r\nmy whole life. ",
        "Jamal: I promise you, baby, it's going to be so much more. I'm going to give \r\nyou everything. ",
        "Alison: I don't need everything. The only reason why I needed that money was to \r\npay for the rent for this place. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I mean, I know that now. I mean, and then I think about \r\neverything you did for me -- ",
        "Alison: No, you did it all. Me and Frank were just helping, that's all. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and I almost blew it. Baby, I came this close. ",
        "Alison: But you didn't. So let's get back to work. We've got a business to \r\nopen. Hmm. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, not so fast. ",
        "Alison: What? Come on, time is money. We got to get going here. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, maybe so, but come on, let's make time for this. ",

        "Gabriela: Well, maybe he took a long drive, you know, to try to cool off. ",
        "Arianna: If that were true, why wouldn't he have told me? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, if he's as angry as you say he was -- ",
        "Arianna: If he's as angry and he went to confront Ben, I don't even want to \r\nthink about it. ",
        "Joe: Think about what? ",
        "Gabriela: Arianna's worried about Ian. ",
        "Arianna: Have you heard from him today? ",
        "Joe: Why, is something wrong? ",
        "Arianna: He's really angry with my brother and I'm afraid he might -- ",
        "Joe: All right, look, look, I'm off now, so I'll go check it out, ok? ",
        "Arianna: You'd do that? ",
        "Joe: Sure. Where's your brother staying? ",
        "Arianna: At the Port Charles Hotel. ",
        "Joe: Ok, if Ian's there, I'll make sure there's no trouble. ",

        "Joe: You know me. Hey, don't worry. Either of you. ",

        "Arianna: Thank God for Joe. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. ",
        "Arianna: I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to Ian. I already feel \r\nso responsible. ",
        "Gabriela: Look, I know Ian, ok, and he wouldn't want you feeling like that.\r\n",
