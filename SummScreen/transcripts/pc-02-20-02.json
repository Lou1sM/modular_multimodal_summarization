        "Alison: Rafe? Rafe, where are you? Where did you fly off to? \"Angel, be back \r\nsoon. Love, Rafe.\" \"Angel.\" That's sweet. ",
        "Rafe: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Hi. ",
        "Rafe: You're up. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: Wow. You look amazing. Here, look, I got some bakery stuff -- \r\ncroissants, to be precise. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I can see that. ",
        "Rafe: Some hot coffee, and these to start the day off right. ",
        "Alison: Those are -- they're beautiful, but why? Why this morning? ",
        "Rafe: First, tell me you love them. Go on, take a whiff. ",
        "Alison: No, I can already tell you I love them. They're beautiful. ",
        "Rafe: Well, that's why I bought them. ",
        "Alison: Wait -- you bought these? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I just, you know, can't make them appear anymore. Oh, well. Well, \r\nlook -- you know, I thought you'd still be upset after last night, you know, \r\nwith Jamal. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I am. You know, I can -- I can still see his face when you -- \r\nwhen you walked in the door and you said that you had made me that key, you \r\nknow, for this place, and he was just so hurt when he realized that I was moving \r\nin with you. ",
        "Rafe: I know. And, see, that kind of got me thinking. ",
        "Alison: About Jamal? ",
        "Rafe: No, about us. You know how much I love you. ",
        "Alison: And I love you, but -- ",
        "Rafe: But -- maybe this whole thing of us just being together six weeks -- \r\nmaybe that's just not right. Maybe it's not -- it's not fair. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: Well, I said \"maybe,\" ok? Not not fair to our friends or to us, but not \r\nfair to you, Alison. It's not fair to you. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Ok, Amy. Let's see if there's something in this picture I might have \r\nmissed before. Hey, if it isn't the mystery woman. ",
        "Amy: Good morning, Sherlock. And what are we up to this morning? ",
        "Chris: Well, we're still digging. ",
        "Amy: Hmm. Any luck? ",
        "Chris: Soon. Very soon. ",
        "Amy: I wouldn't count on it. You've been spending all this time trying to \r\nsniff out my secret, and I haven't got one. ",
        "[Chris chuckles] ",
        "Chris: Oh, Amy, everybody's got secrets. ",
        "Amy: All right, that's it. Where is it? ",
        "Chris: Where's what? ",
        "Amy: You know what. Hand it over. ",
        "Chris: What? ",
        "Amy: My hospital I.D. I had it right here. ",
        "Chris: Well, then it should still be there. ",
        "Amy: Well, it would have still been here if you hadn't stolen it for your \r\nsilly investigation. ",
        "Chris: Amy, I already have one silly picture of you. Why would I need your \r\nI.D.? ",
        "Amy: I don't know, ok? All I know is that it's missing. And if it's not here \r\nand you say you don't have it -- ",
        "Chris: I don't. ",
        "Amy: Fine. Then where is it? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: You just happened to find Amy's I.D. Just lying around? ",
        "Ian: Never mind how I got it. Just scan it so I can get it back to her before \r\nshe starts missing it. ",
        "Kevin: Let's just hope Victor's contacts at the agency have the information \r\nwe need. Like, how are Amy and Paige connected? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, how? That's the question. ",
        "Kevin: Well, let's hope they have more than they both wear a strange watch \r\nand the watch points to the number six. ",
        "Ian: And that Amy's leaving in six weeks. ",
        "Kevin: And we don't know what Paige's plans are. Ok, e-mail's ready. Just \r\nattach the scan. Ok. Before we know it, we might have the information we need. \r\nAnd there it goes. ",
        "Paige: There goes what? What are you two fine doctors up to this morning? ",

        "Alison: Our being together is not fair? ",
        "Rafe: To you, Alison. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, I want to be with you. I want to be with you as long as I can.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Ok. Look. See this? Look at it, all right? ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Rafe: There are six weeks on the clock, ok? That's it. Go on, look. You see? \r\nThat's it. ",
        "Alison: I know about the watch. ",
        "Rafe: And so, when my time's up, I'm gone. And I'm not coming back. ",
        "Alison: Ok, stop. ",
        "Rafe: Ever. Ok? And I just don't think it's right for me to just fall into \r\nyour life like this and expect you to change everything that counts and have you \r\nopen up your heart -- ",
        "Alison: You didn't make me do anything. ",
        "Rafe: And get wound up in this whirlwind romance. In a couple weeks, I'm just \r\ngoing to vanish, leaving you here, and I don't think that's right. ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok, listen to me. ",
        "Rafe: Whatever you think, I don't think it's right. ",
        "Alison: This is my choice, ok? I'm here because I want to be here. And the \r\nonly thing that is not fair is that you can't stay with me forever. ",
        "Rafe: I wish I could change that. I can't. ",
        "Alison: I know you do. I know -- I know you can't, ok? And I'm ok with that.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Right. ",
        "Alison: Listen to me. This really is right where I want to be. Even if it \r\nwere only six minutes, I would still be right here. ",
        "Rafe: I'd do anything if I could stay here, if I could just take this watch \r\nand stop time and stop the hands from moving. ",
        "Alison: You know, I am so sick of this watch. I'm so sick of this thing! ",
        "Rafe: Ok, you're sick of it. Would you give it back to me, please? ",
        "Alison: All it does is just remind me that you're going to be leaving and I \r\njust hate it! ",
        "Rafe: Alison, don't! ",
        "Alison: I hate it! ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Well, you -- you heard that, Ian. What are we up to? ",
        "Ian: I heard that, sure. ",
        "Paige: It must be very interesting, considering the way you two are manning \r\nthat machine like armed guards. ",
        "Kevin: No, no -- ",
        "Ian: No, we're -- ",
        "Kevin: Well, we're -- ",
        "Ian: We're working together. ",
        "Kevin: Right. ",
        "Paige: On a case? ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Exactly. Ian has a patient -- ",
        "Ian: Who we think is withholding some information. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. So he wanted to discuss the psychology, see if he could find a \r\nway to break down the barrier. ",
        "Ian: With the mysterious parts of the case that I don't, you know -- ",
        "Kevin: Right, right. Exactly. Which is good. Which is good because I did want \r\nto explain something to you. I'm afraid this case will take up quite a bit of my \r\ntime, and that means moonlighting as a portrait painter will have to take a back \r\nseat for a while. ",
        "Paige: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. ",
        "Kevin: But you understand? ",
        "Paige: Well, of course, yes. I mean, we can just start up again as soon as \r\nyou guys are finished. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's just the thing. This case could tie me up for weeks. ",
        "Ian: Months. ",
        "Paige: Months? ",
        "Ian: Well, it's a -- it's an interesting case. We're trying to write it up, \r\nyou know. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Paige: But, Kevin, you can't. I mean, I can't -- I don't have have that much \r\ntime left. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I just assumed you would understand that my work has to come \r\nfirst, Paige. ",
        "Paige: But the portrait, it's -- ",
        "Kevin: It's just going to have to wait. ",
        "Paige: But -- but it can't wait, Kevin, because I have to leave. ",
        "Kevin: Well, where exactly are you going? ",
        "Paige: Back home. ",
        "Kevin: To England? ",
        "Paige: There are some things that I need to take care of, and I need to go \r\nback. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I mean, there's no reason why we can't pick this up again once \r\nyou come back here. ",
        "Paige: I won't be coming back here, Kevin. Not for a long time. That's why \r\nit's so important to finish the portrait now. ",
        "Kevin: Oh. Well, when are you leaving? ",
        "Paige: Soon. ",
        "Ian: How soon? ",
        "Paige: Um -- six weeks. ",
        "Kevin: Six weeks? That soon? ",
        "Paige: That soon. ",
        "",
        "Chris: What is the big deal? I have even placed things in the wrong spot and, \r\nyou know, ended up looking for it, wondering where it went. And you -- come on, \r\nyou're blind, right? ",
        "Amy: Oh, you are a master detective. You know something, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Yes, I do. Absolutely. I know that I'm really close to figuring out \r\nthis little secret of yours. ",
        "Amy: Ok. I give up. You're too smart for me. I'm an undercover agent for the \r\nCIA. ",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Amy: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, actually, I would buy that one. Or maybe -- ",
        "Amy: Hmm? ",
        "Chris: A porn star. ",
        "Amy: Ah, you got me again. Who ratted me out? ",
        "Chris: Or a con artist. ",
        "Amy: Uh-huh. ",
        "Chris: Or an amateur square dancing champion. Or a Central American dictator.\r\n",
        "Amy: All the above and more, doctor. Why are you looking down? How about \r\nlooking at me? ",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. Good ears. ",
        "Amy: I'm waiting to hear a good answer. ",
        "Chris: Well, I think I just found the first clue as to what your secret might \r\nbe. ",
        "Amy: Really? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. It's in this -- this picture I have of you. ",
        "Amy: Oh, God. Not that stupid picture again. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, you're wearing a necklace. ",
        "Amy: Yeah. It's not me. ",
        "Chris: Oh, no. No, it's definitely you. But the initials are wrong. ",
        "Alison: Well, you see? ",
        "Chris: It's not A.S. -- Amy Stradling. It's A.H. ",
        "Alison: So? ",
        "Chris: So I'm wondering what the \"H\" stands for. Come on, Amy. What's your \r\nname? What's your real name? ",

        "Kevin: Six weeks? ",
        "Paige: That's all I have. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I thought you'd at least stay here until the painting was \r\nfinished. ",
        "Paige: Well, I didn't think it would take this long. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. I didn't know I had a time limit. ",
        "Paige: Isn't there some way we could finish the portrait before I leave? \r\nPlease. I mean, I'll pose for you any time you have a spare moment -- midnight, \r\ndawn. Promise you'll try. ",
        "Kevin: I don't see why we can't work it into the schedule, right? ",
        "Ian: Well, if she only has six weeks left. ",
        "Paige: Does that mean you'll try? ",
        "Kevin: Of course I'll try. We'll make it work, don't worry. ",
        "Paige: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, please. ",
        "Paige: It means so much to me, you have no idea. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Paige: Thanks. Well, I'll let you two get back to work. Ian? ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "[Kevin sighs] ",
        "Kevin: So, Amy and Paige are both leaving in six weeks. But where? ",
        "Ian: Why is this portrait so important to her? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. ",
        "Ian: And I thought she was going to go nuts when you said that you weren't \r\ngoing to finish it. Something's strange about her. ",
        "Kevin: She has a secret. But trust me, she is not some alien shape-forming \r\npod person clone from a B movie. ",
        "Ian: Are you sure about that? Things pop up around here. ",
        "Kevin: I grew up with this woman. ",
        "Ian: Uh-huh. ",
        "Kevin: She knows things about me no one else could possibly know. That is \r\nPaige, the real Paige. ",
        "Ian: Maybe it's not the Paige you remember. Maybe something happened to her.\r\n",
        "Kevin: And to Amy. Maybe that's what connected them. ",
        "Ian: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Ian: You say you know Paige, that you can vouch for her. ",
        "Kevin: Right, right. But Amy's a stranger. ",
        "Ian: No, but she isn't. Not to everyone in this town. There's someone who \r\nthinks he knows her from his past. ",
        "Kevin: Who? ",

        "Chris: Yeah. And forget about telling me that you don't know what I'm talking \r\nabout. ",
        "Amy: I would like to forget all about this conversation. I've got too many \r\nimportant things to -- ",
        "Chris: And forget about changing the subject. ",
        "Amy: You want to talk about this subject? I am exactly who I say that I am. I \r\nhave no deep, dark secret, other than I don't floss every day. ",
        "Chris: Oh, that's funny. ",
        "Amy: No. You know what's funny? Or rather sad? Is that a man like you has so \r\nlittle to do with his life that he's sitting down with some dime-store \r\nmagnifying glass looking at a picture of me -- ",
        "Chris: Hey, I will have you know that I actually paid $25 for this magnifying \r\nglass. And I had the picture enlarged, anyway. That was pretty clever, huh? ",
        "Amy: No question about it, Chris. You're out of your mind. Mm-hmm. ",
        "Chris: No question about it, Amy. You're lying. Now, I may not know what your \r\nsecret is just yet, but I'm getting there. ",
        "Amy: Well, how about try getting a life? ",
        "Chris: Hmm. ",
        "Amy: That might help. ",
        "Chris: Yeah. You know, maybe you're right. In fact, could you maybe give me a \r\nfew tips? ",

        "Alison: Every time you pull it out. It's just six weeks, that's all it is. \r\n\"Just six weeks, Alison.\" Just six weeks until you're gone. Six weeks, and you'd \r\nbetter hurry up. Just six weeks. Six weeks -- it's just not a lifetime, which is \r\nwhat it should be. And it's just -- ",
        "Rafe: Just six weeks. ",

        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: That phrase -- Livvie said that Victor found a watch and he said that \r\nit was not of this earth -- those were his exact words, too. He said that like \r\nit was -- I don't know -- it disappeared or it was stolen or something, and \r\nthere was no proof of it either way. But one minute, it was there, and then the \r\nnext minute, it was gone. It was, like, this -- ",

        "Rafe: Of course, right, there are angels everywhere. ",
        "Alison: No, no, no. No, no, no. Don't do that because I believed in angels \r\nfirst, before you, but what I'm talking about is that, like, there's probably \r\nangels here in town! That's totally different! ",
        "Rafe: Just let it go, ok? ",
        "Alison: No. How can I? This is amazing. Are you kidding me? I mean, like, I \r\nthought that there was angels, you know, watching over us. I always believed \r\nthat.

        "Rafe: On anyone else finding out about me, or anyone else, or -- or anything \r\nelse, or anything having to do with this watch or any other watch or just \r\nanything. Do you understand? I can't take the chance! ",
        "Alison: Rafe, stop. You're afraid. ",
        "Rafe: Yes, I'm afraid. They can pull us back any time, Alison! ",
        "Alison: \"Us,\" \"us,\" \"us.\" Rafe -- oh, you said \"us.\" ",
        "Rafe: Ok, listen. In the six weeks we have left here, if anytime during that \r\ntime anyone suspects there are angels here, they can just -- take away our \r\npasses at any time. And then we just disappear, like that. ",
