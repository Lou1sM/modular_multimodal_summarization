        "Casey enlists Jamal's help to protect Ricky. At the party, Caleb celebrates being himself again. Reese prepares to bite Ricky, but Jamal picks a fight with him to get him away from the vamp. Casey worries when Caz steps in to help Ricky. Ian is frustrated about the failure his antidote. Rafe informs Lucy and Ian that it's time to go after Caleb, adding that Lucy is the one who has to actually slay the vampire. Lucy doesn't like this, but Rafe convinces her that she's the only one who can do the job. Lucy worries about what will happen to her cousin when she kills Caleb, but Rafe really doesn't know what will happen. They just have to hope for the best. Lucy is encouraged by Ian's belief in her, and when Rafe hands her a silver gun, she feels confident that she can use it. Jack tells Tess that the only way to help Caleb is to make him stop drinking the water. Tess is happy to be working with her husband on this, but he feels very guilty about his deceit. Tess finds Caleb, but he doesn't want to talk to her now or ever again. It hurts Tess that he could turn his back on her so easily. She tells him that she does love him in her own way. This clearly has an effect on him."

        "Tess: I do, and you said you would help me.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, and I meant it. It's just that if you're going to do this, I want to do it, you know, all the way.",
        "Tess: So do I.",
        "Jack: It's just that Stephen sometimes can hide himself, his true self, his true feelings.",
        "Tess: Hide?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Tess, not just from you but from all of us. And unless you can find some way to get past that barrier, then I don't know if you'll be able to save him.",

        "Ian: I'd prefer a more direct approach myself.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, you see, that way everybody gets killed. Caleb is too strong and too smart. This way we break him down, we make him like any other man -- vulnerable to the charms of a beautiful woman.",
        "Lucy: All right. Well, let's just hope Tess can get Caleb to let his guard down. And then what, you move in for the kill, yeah?",

        "Jamal: Ok, ok, ok. Slow down, slow down.",
        "Casey: Ok, and I'm really, really in big trouble this time, ok? Because I'm not allowed to interfere in anybody's life and I can't stop them from doing this thing. But you don't -- if you don't, then he's a gonner, and then if he's a gonner, then I'm going to die!",

        "Rafe: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: I didn't -- I --",
        "Rafe: Lucy, you can do it. I know you can.",
        "Ian: Is there any specific reason why it can't be you?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, there's a very specific reason.",
        "Ian: Well, what is it? Why don't you two talk it over.",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Rafe: I'm --",
        "Lucy: What is this? What is it?",
        "Rafe: I don't want to talk about this in front of Ian.",
        "Lucy: What? Why can't -- what is it? Why can't you talk in front of him?",
        "Rafe: I can't kill Caleb, remember? He's back because of me. You know, the balance.",
        "Lucy: Of good and evil. I remember.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. But a slayer still has to make the kill.",
        "Lucy: And I'm the only other slayer.",
        "Rafe: So you have to do it.",
        "Lucy: Ok. I know.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. If there was another way, I --",
        "Lucy: I know. I understand. I need to hear it again. Explain to me one more time about the balance between good and evil.",
        "Rafe: Look, it's complicated and it's not important right now.",
        "Lucy: Well, it's important to me because obviously it's very important to you.",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine. Caleb got to come back because I got to come back. When I got my pass, he got his pass.",
        "Lucy: I get that. Ok, so if I kill -- Rafe, if I kill him, what happens to you?",
        "Rafe: All right, forget it. First things first.",
        "Lucy: No. We're not going to forget it. If I kill him, what happens to you?",
        "Rafe: I don't know! I don't know!",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, you don't know? Do you think I can go through with that if I have to kill you? No.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, you do, you have to.",
        "Lucy: I can't!",
        "Rafe: Yes, you do. I'm counting on you, all right? Everyone is counting on you.",
        "Ian: Ok, I'm back.",
        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Ian: What'd you come up with?",
        "Rafe: Nothing -- look, Lucy's a little nervous about this whole thing, but I think she's all right now.",
        "Ian: You're still not going to tell me, are you?",
        "Lucy: I got to tell you later. I think at Rafe's main point here is, is that Caleb would suspect him if he tried to take him down and he'd never suspect me because he just doesn't think I'm strong enough, so we'd have an advantage there. Is that right, Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Ian: What's the plan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I don't understand. All of a sudden you think there's no way to save -- save Stephen. You don't have faith in me?",
        "Jack: No. No, no, no, Tess, I have faith in you. It's just I don't have faith in him. You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved.",
        "Tess: But it wasn't that long ago when you thought I could. And now you're talking about barriers and secrets and stuff.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. Look, the water. It's the water. It kind of like a drug.",
        "Tess: A drug?",
        "Jack: Yeah. And when he drinks it, he's not himself, he doesn't show his true self. And unless we can get that water away from him -- unless you can get the water away from him, I don't know if you'll be able to reach into him.",
        "Tess: Oh, I never thought about that.",
        "Jack: Look, Tess, I understand --",
        "Tess: No, no. It's -- it's ok. It's all right. I -- I could never figure out why I always sensed it. I knew something was keeping Stephen from opening up. It's the water. Now, if I can just get him to stop drinking it, I -- I -- Jack, why are you looking at me like that? I just -- I want to get Stephen to stop.",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's just that --",
        "Tess: I just want to do whatever is best. I just want to do that.",
        "Jack: Well, if you can get the water away from him, that would be best.",
        "Tess: Ok. Thank you. I would've never thought about this without you. Thank you.",
        "Tess: Ok. All I have to do to reach the real Stephen is get him to stop drinking the water.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, not so fast. Getting him to stop won't be that easy. And we don't want him to think something's wrong and get him riled up.",
        "Tess: Right. It's got to be the right time, the right place, the right -- the right way. I've got it. It's perfect. I'll take him to the overlook.",
        "Jack: The one you showed me?",
        "Tess: Yeah. There was something about it there, the city lights, and, you know, he doesn't have to look over his shoulder. That's where I'll take him. Ok, I know what to do now. I just -- I got to find Stephen and --",
        "Jack: But --",
        "Tess: Jack, I know how hard this is for you, but after talking it over, I'm more sure than ever it's the right thing toto do.",
        "Jack: But, Tess, I just --",
        "Tess: Hey, I -- I trust you. Jack, I know you wouldn't send me out to Stephen if you didn't think I could change him. You really do believe in me. Do you know how wonderful that makes me feel? It's like tonight, for the first time, we're more than just husband and wife, we're partners. I will be back before you know it, and I'm going to tell you everything.",
        "Jack: Hey -- I love you.",
        "Tess: I love you, too. Bye.",
        "Jack: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So the music box opens and Livvie pops out.",
        "Rafe: Right. And while Caleb is taking it all in --",
        "Lucy: I pull the trigger.",
        "Ian: Sounds a little too easy.",
        "Rafe: Trust me, it's not easy. Tess is going to have to get Caleb's water away, make him completely vulnerable. Then we got to hope that Caleb is still into Livvie as ever.",
        "Lucy: And we have to hope I'm a lot better shot than I was last time.",
        "Ian: I'll be right there beside you.",
        "Lucy: You better be. And you -- you will be right there when we're finished -- we are finished and we will all celebrate together.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah, I want that more than anything. Look -- I forgot something in the car for you, so I'll be right back.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "Lucy: I think what we're going to need here is another miracle.",
        "Ian: You're not going to tell me, are you?",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Ian: Why you have to do this instead of him.",
        "Lucy: I -- I just can't right now.",
        "Ian: Slayer stuff, this?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Ian: Yeah. You nervous?",
        "Lucy: You bet your life.",
        "Ian: Don't be. You can do this. You know you can. I've seen your strength. When I was losing it, you were there and you -- you got it out of me. So I believe in you with all my heart.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Ian: And when this is all over and I got my son back and we've got our life back, I've got you to thank for it.",
        "Lucy: Everything in balance.",

        "Reese: How about before you do that, you come with me?",
        "Ricky: Oh, yeah? Where are we going?",
        "Reese: To the back room. I've got a gift for you.",
        "Ricky: Ooh. Is it a nice, big surprise?",

        "Jamal: Hey, Ricky. How are you doing?",
        "Ricky: What's up?",
        "Jamal: That's for kissing my girl, Marissa.",
        "Caleb: Joshua, you're not leaving, are you?",
        "Joshua: It's getting a little too much out of control in there for me now. Anyway, as band manager, I have business to attend to, but I'll be back.",
        "Caleb: Better you than me.",
        "Joshua: Oh, Stephen -- I'm glad to see you getting back to being your old self.",
        "Caleb: I'll drink to that.",
        "Caleb's voice: What are you trying to say?",
        "Tess's voice: What I'm trying to say -- I can feel the goodness inside you. It's there.",
        "Kevin's voice: Come on, Caleb. The longer you live among us, the more like us you become. You're becoming human.",
        "Caleb: Not anymore. Tess.",
        "Tess: I need to talk to you, Stephen.",
        "Caleb: Now is not a good time.",
        "Tess: Later, then?",
        "Caleb: No, Tess. Not now, not later, not ever.",
        "Ricky: What the hell was that all about, huh?",
        "Jamal: What was it about? You know what that was all about.",
        "Ricky: No, I don't know!",
        "Jamal: You don't know? Me and Marissa are not even cold yet, and you're already hitting up all over her, man --",
        "Ricky: That's what you're talking about?",

        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, it's something I got to do for both of us.",
        "Jack: Come on, Tess, this is your chance. Walk away.",
        "Tess: Every time you've ever needed me, asked for me, I've been there for you against all my friends' advice, even my own husband. And you know why? Because I believed in our friendship and the good that was inside of you. And now the one time I come to you on my own, you tell me to just go away is it that easy to turn your back on me?",
