        "Alison: Rafe, I'm done unpacking, so if you wanted to go -- where did you -- \r\noh! ",
        "Rafe: I'm right here. ",
        "Alison: What are you doing? ",
        "Rafe: I promised you if you moved in, I would carry you across the threshold, \r\nand angels always keep their promises. ",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah? ",
        "Rafe: Yep. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Well, you didn't -- I didn't know that's what you were talking \r\nabout. ",
        "Lucy: Get Bananas the Bear -- ",
        "Alison: Ooh. Hi. Hi! ",
        "Christina: Hi. ",
        "Alison: Hi. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. ",

        "Amy: That leech, Chris Ramsey, keeps digging into my past. ",
        "Paige: Why? What's he doing now? ",
        "Amy: He had that damn picture of me blown up! ",
        "Paige: Ok, calm down. Because unless that picture has a halo over your head, \r\nI mean, he's not going to figure out you're an angel. ",
        "Amy: I know, but -- ",
        "Paige: But what? ",
        "Amy: I am being flooded with memories of my life before I died. ",
        "Paige: Oh, my God, I know. Me, too. ",
        "Amy: But I thought I could resolve it all. I thought this was my chance, that \r\nI could deal with the past, if that's all there was, but other things keep \r\ngetting in the way. I can't do this. I can't keep feeling all of this. It's just \r\ntoo confusing. ",
        "Paige: Look, I don't think any of us expected to feel this human. But, I \r\nmean, it doesn't have to be all bad, not if you go with it. ",
        "Amy: I can't. ",
        "Paige: Suit yourself. All I know is I have never felt so alive or so sure of \r\nmy purpose. It's worth it. ",
        "Amy: It's not worth it! Not -- never mind. ",
        "Paige: Why don't you just admit it, Amy? ",
        "Amy: Admit what? ",
        "Paige: That you're falling in love with Ian Thornhart. ",

        "Ian: How much longer is it going to take for this file to get here? ",
        "Kevin: It should be here any minute. Try a little patience. ",
        "Ian: How can I try patience if Victor's people are telling us that Amy is \r\ndead? There's got to be some kind of mistake, some kind of explanation other \r\nthan this. ",
        "Kevin: It's the only logical explanation, Ian. ",
        "Ian: Meaning what? ",
        "Kevin: What am I? Buddha? I don't know. ",

        "Lucy: Why don't we get your jacket off, and you can take Bananas the Bear here \r\nand introduce him to all Mommy's stuffed animals in our bedroom. You want to? \r\nOk, I'll see you in a minute, all right? Tell them hi for me. Ok, shall we \r\nspill, tell, all, go? ",
        "Rafe: Well, I probably should've asked, but I thought you were too busy, and \r\nI -- ",
        "Lucy: No, wait -- no -- stop. I'm talking about way back, from the beginning \r\n-- let's start, like, for instance, I happen to know that you and Jamal broke \r\nup, because Livvie told me. ",
        "Alison: Right, right. ",
        "Lucy: Right, and I also know that you, cousin, have been falling for \r\nsomebody. I just never dreamed it was going to be Alison. ",
        "Alison: Well, we never expected, you know, either one of us, you know, for \r\nthis to happen. It's just that we did have feelings for each other for a while \r\n-- ",
        "Rafe: Right, and it just sort of happened. ",
        "Alison: And then Jamal and I broke up, yeah. ",
        "Rafe: And I was lucky enough that she felt the same way. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and we're really, really in love, Lucy, and Rafe just thought \r\nthat -- ",
        "Rafe: Well, I thought that since you were living at the lighthouse, that it \r\nwould be ok if we stayed here, but, like I said earlier, I probably should've \r\nasked -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok, no, wait, wait. ",
        "Rafe: I know that. ",
        "Lucy: No, you don't have to ask. You know that. My home is your home. That's \r\nnot the point. The point is, is you're the point, and I think I need to talk to \r\nyou. ",
        "Alison: Oh, alone, right. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Ok, I'm going to go -- ",
        "Lucy: Could you check on Bananas and Christina? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I will. Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, good. Thank you. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Now, you know, I hate to bring this up, but five minutes ago, \r\nAlison was completely in love with Jamal. So, what about you? ",
        "Rafe: What about me? ",
        "Lucy: Have you ever heard that expression -- maybe you haven't -- \"on the \r\nrebound?\" ",
        "Rafe: It's not like that. ",
        "Lucy: Are you sure? Do you know what? I happen to know a little bit more \r\nabout this love stuff than you, and she might just be very well on the rebound, \r\nand you might get hurt. I don't want to see you get hurt. ",
        "Rafe: My eyes are wide open, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: What I see in those hazel eyes of yours are stars sparkling all over \r\nthe place. ",
        "Rafe: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, ok, ok. All right, let's go here. Answer me a question -- have you \r\never, ever really been in love? ",
        "Rafe: What kind of question is that? ",
        "Lucy: It's a very, very simple question. Just answer it with a simple yes or \r\nno. ",
        "Rafe: No. ",
        "Lucy: Ok! There! I rest my case! Perhaps we should just slow the heck down in \r\nthis whole relationship thing. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, no, no, I can't! Because whatever love is, ok, however you \r\ndefine it, this is what it is for me. I mean, for the first time ever, I know \r\nexactly what I want and who I want. And, see, Alison and I, we've been dancing \r\naround this for months, so the feelings have always been there, and we finally \r\njust let them out, and it just -- it feels right, Lucy. You know what? It is \r\nright. I know that and I believe that with all my heart, really. ",
        "Lucy: You really do, don't you? ",
        "Rafe: I've never been more sure of anything. ",
        "Lucy: Go -- good grief. Ok, then, I'm -- ooh, all right. I'm happy for you, \r\nthen. Ok, this is good. Oh! Wait a minute. This is very good. This means you'll \r\nbe staying. You'll be staying in Port Charles, right? ",
        "Rafe: I'm -- actually, I'll only be here a few more weeks. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I'm -- I'm still leaving. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, wait -- so you and Alison are going away together? ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, it's -- ahem. Just me. ",
        "Lucy: Just you? Oh, let me get this straight. You've fallen madly in love \r\nwith Alison, you're moving in together, and now you're just going to take off? \r\nOk. I'm nuts for thinking that you were going to get hurt. What are you doing? \r\nWhat are you thinking? Alison's the one that's going to get hurt. You know, if \r\nyou do this, you're going to break that girl's heart. ",
        "",
        "Amy: Whatever I feel for Ian isn't the reason why I'm here. ",
        "Paige: None of us expected to feel this, for this to happen. None of us \r\nexpected for this to be so intense. I mean, look at Rafe. He's fallen head over \r\nheels for that Alison girl, and even Casey's found some boy she's falling for.\r\n",
        "Amy: Yeah, and then in a couple weeks, we'll all have to go back. ",
        "Paige: Yes. But we also know that someone's coming back with us. That could \r\nbe Ian -- or Kevin. ",
        "Amy: Or neither one of them. ",
        "Paige: Which is even more reason to enjoy the time we have -- in case it \r\ndoesn't last. What if I found out that Kevin still has feelings for me? What if \r\nmy last earthly memory was of Kevin loving me back? ",
        "Amy: It's not the same for me. ",
        "Paige: Why not? Haven't you ever been in love? I mean, you must have had \r\nsomebody who loved you. ",
        "Amy: I had somebody that loved me. He cared more about me than he did his own \r\nlife. And then he died. ",
        "Paige: I'm sorry. ",
        "Amy: And then I got involved with that other man. ",
        "Paige: Who you thought you could trust. ",
        "Amy: Yeah. ",
        "Paige: Who killed you. ",
        "Amy: I have to go. I'll call you later, ok? ",

        "",
        "Ian: I know Amy. I've talked to her. She's as alive as you and me. ",
        "Kevin: Well, not according to this photograph. ",
        "Ian: Maybe they were staged or doctored or something. I don't know. ",
        "Kevin: They were taken in a murder investigation. They found the body. ",
        "Ian: There's got to be another explanation, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Are we sure that's Amy in that picture? ",
        "Ian: The cane's right next to her. Unless she has an identical blind sister, \r\nthen, yeah, that's Amy. ",
        "Kevin: Where are you going? ",
        "Ian: Going to find some answers. ",
        "Kevin: No, wait, wait, wait, wait. What, are you going to talk to her? What \r\nare you going to say? \"Excuse me, Amy, are you really dead?\" ",
        "Ian: You got a better idea? ",
        "Kevin: Yes. Paige and Amy's connection. ",
        "Ian: What about it? ",
        "Kevin: Let's add it up. They're both wearing watches that Victor says are \r\nmade of material not of this world. They both came to and are leaving Port \r\nCharles at the same time, and they both have holes in their stories big enough \r\nto drive a truck through. And somehow, the truth is connected to the two of \r\nthem. ",
        "Ian: And you think that connection can explain this? ",
        "Kevin: Well, it has to add up to something! It's just that that's all we have \r\nto go on. ",
        "Ian: We need more than that. ",
        "Kevin: Well -- maybe we can draw them out. ",
        "Ian: How? ",
        "Kevin: Well, I know Paige. She trusts me. You and Amy have gotten pretty \r\nfriendly. ",
        "Ian: What's that supposed to mean? ",
        "Kevin: Not that! I'm just saying -- instead of interrogating them, why don't \r\nwe just keep our cards a little closer to the vest? You know, let them talk \r\nabout themselves, find out about their past, why they're leaving town at the \r\nsame time -- anything that'll help us put this together. ",
        "Ian: Got to do something. I'll be in touch. ",
        "Kevin: All right. ",
        "Paige: Is that the case you're working on? May I take a look? ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Look, Alison and I have talked about me leaving, and she understands, \r\nok? ",
        "Lucy: She understands? How? I mean, what kind of woman would fall in love \r\nlike this and obviously get herself involved in a serious relationship, as \r\nserious as this is, and then just have it last a few weeks? What kind of woman \r\nwould do that? ",
        "Alison: This woman would, Lucy. I'm sorry to interrupt, but, Lucy, I know \r\nthat it's probably hard to understand because it would be hard for me to \r\nunderstand, too, but I have accepted that Rafe's time here is short. And I know \r\nthat it may not be our destiny to be together forever, but we are going to try \r\nand pack in as much love and life into the few, short weeks that he does have \r\nleft. ",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, \"few, short --\" are you sick? Is that what this is \r\nabout? You're dying or something? ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, that's not why I'm leaving, no. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then why? Why? I don't understand this. You look so happy. You \r\nfall madly in love with Alison and you move in together. How can you just walk \r\naway? ",
        "Rafe: I can't explain, ok? ",
        "Lucy: You have to try for me because I understand what your destiny has been \r\nup to now. I mean, you were supposed to keep the world safe from the Morleys. \r\nYou did that. You accomplished that. You got rid of Caleb. He was the last one. \r\nSo now you're done with all that. Now you have a chance to put down roots, and \r\nwhat better reason than falling in love with somebody? ",
        "Alison: Lucy, please. Just try and accept it, ok, because it is the way that \r\nit has to be. ",
        "Rafe: See, the reasons I have for leaving are a lot more complicated and \r\npersonal than I can share with you. But just know this -- Alison and I are \r\nhappy. Than I ever could've hoped for in a whole lifetime. And any time that we \r\nget to spend together, I see it as a blessing. And it would make me really happy \r\nif you could just be happy for us. ",
        "Lucy: I -- I somehow am. I -- I am. ",
        "Christina: Mommy? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, hey, sweet pea. Hey. You ok? What? What's wrong? ",
        "Christina: I don't feel good. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. Oh, boy. Oh, you're getting a little warm there, pumpkin head. \r\nListen, we need to take your temperature, ok? We'll do that good one, you know? \r\nWe need to take a temperature here. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: We'll be back. Come on, let's take Bananas. I'll take Bananas' temperature, \r\ntoo, ok? Come on. Yes. ",
        "Rafe: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: It was a nice speech. Thanks. ",
        "Alison: I just sort of wished that I believed it because I haven't really \r\naccepted you leaving. I just don't want to lose you. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Actually, professional ethics prohibit me from ever discussing a case. \r\nAnd I don't care what Ian said, it's not that interesting. You'd be bored to \r\ndeath. ",
        "Paige: Don't be silly. I love learning about what you do. Reconnecting with \r\nyou has meant so much to me. We still have so much to talk about. ",
        "Kevin: You're right, only I'd rather do it over a glass of wine. Have a seat. \r\nChardonnay still your favorite? ",
        "Paige: You remember. ",
        "Kevin: Of course I remember. I remember all sorts of great things from back \r\nthen. You know, it's a shame that you have to leave so soon. When are you \r\nleaving again? ",
        "Paige: Six weeks. But we already talked about this. I have an appointment I \r\ncan't be late for. ",
        "Kevin: Right, right. And then, of course, you can't come back to Port \r\nCharles. ",
        "Paige: No. As much as I would like to, I'm afraid that's impossible. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'll say this -- you sure organize your life better than I do. \r\nThat must be some appointment. ",
        "Paige: Yes. One, unfortunately, I cannot miss. May I? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, of course. Sorry. ",
        "Paige: Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: Well, here's to you, Paige. I'm glad you came back into my life. ",
        "Paige: Me, too. A lot of things have changed. Then again, a lot hasn't. ",
        "Kevin: Do you remember that ski trip we took? ",
        "Paige: You mean where we didn't make it to the slopes? We traveled all that \r\nway just to stay curled up in front of the fireplace. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, yes, we did, didn't we? ",
        "Paige: Well, I guess some things you never forget. ",
        "Kevin: I bet you don't remember the birthday present I gave you. ",
        "Paige: Which one would that be? You mean that beautiful necklace with my \r\nbirthstone in it? ",
        "Kevin: Hmm, no, but that one was nice. No, I'm thinking of the other one. \r\nCome on, you know. The watch? ",
        "Paige: You never gave me a watch. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, I did. It's not as nice as the one you have now, but I definitely \r\ngave you a watch. ",
        "Paige: No, Kevin. You never gave me a watch. ",
        "Kevin: Oops. I guess that was somebody else. ",
        "Paige: What's going on? ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? ",
        "Paige: I mean, the last time we talked, you were telling me how swamped you \r\nwere with work -- so much so that you couldn't finish my portrait. And now \r\nyou're asking questions about the past, most of which you already know. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm just strolling down memory lane. ",
        "Paige: Well, and then you make something up which you know is wrong. Almost \r\nas if -- well, I don't know -- that you were trying to trick me. What's going \r\non? What do you want to know? ",
