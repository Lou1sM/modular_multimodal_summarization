        "When Rafe doesn't return any of her calls, Alison becomes convinced that he went after Caleb. She's worried that if his plan to kill the vampire succeeds, she'll lose him forever. Rafe, Lucy, and Ian go to the overlook to wait, unaware that Kevin is following them. Caleb doesn't understand how Tess could say that she loves him, considering what she knows about him. Tess believes that he created her to love him for who he is. She knocks the water out of his hand, saying that it keeps her from reaching the man inside. She persuades him to go with her to the overlook. As soon as they're gone, Jack comes out of hiding but is immediately stopped by the band's security guards. He assures them that he doesn't want to crash the party. Casey watches nervously as Jamal throws Caz a sucker punch and runs out of the building. Jack is still there when Jamal gets outside. Suddenly, Caz swings, Jamal ducks, and Jack ends up on the ground. When the police arrest Jack, Jamal creates a diversion to let him get away. Reese prepares to give a clueless Ricky \"the gift that keeps on giving.\" Casey arrives in time to see the vamp bare her fangs, but she doesn't know what to do about it. At the overlook, Tess continues to work on Caleb, but he doesn't want her help. Despite her insistence to the contrary, all he wants is to have Olivia back. Tess vows that she'll never let that happen. Caleb is puzzled when he hears the familiar sounds of the music box. When Livvie surfaces, he is absolutely thrilled. Kevin comes out of hiding to see what's going on. He steps into Lucy's path just as she takes aim at Caleb and fires."

        "Alison: Please. We've already talked about this a thousand times. Elizabet I just know that you're still upset.",
        "Alison: Well, this isn't about you right now. I'm thinking about something else. I can't find rafe. I've called him a bunch of times and he's not calling me back.",

        "Rafe: We don't know that.",
        "Lucy: All we know is that there is this balance in the universe, the good versus the evil. It's balanced because you're back, and that's why caleb's back.",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, just let's not think about that right now. We got a job to do, and that's all there is to it, all right? I'm going to make that call.",

        "Tess: That's exactly why.",
        "Caleb: I tried to get rid of you just to get to olivia. Why would you still have faith in me? Why do you keep coming back?",
        "Tess: Because you created me.",
        "Caleb: But I told you why.",
        "Tess: No, I don't believe it was just to separate the good livvie from the bad. I think what you were trying to do was create someone who loved you for you.",

        "Tess: Stop hiding behind the water.",
        "Caleb: Hiding?",
        "Tess: I know what it does, stephen. It masks the real you. And the real you is who I'm trying to reach, who I want to know. This existence of yours, being a vampire -- I know and you know it's not what you wanted for yourself. It's not what you asked for. It was forced on you.",
        "Caleb: I never should've told you that.",
        "Tess: I'm glad you did. Look at me, stephen. I can see the pain in your face. You don't have to go on living like this. Come with me. Please? Let me help you.",

        "Ian: But you're afraid you won't be able to do it?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah. No, I'm going to do it. I'm just anxious because I'm not sure what's going to happen. I don't understand the outcome here at all.",
        "Ian: You know what's going to happen. You'll take care of it, caleb will be gone. Then you, me, and rafe will celebrate.",
        "Lucy: Hope you're right.",
        "Ian: Come on.",
        "Rafe: Ok, I found a place. It's hidden, we still have a clear view of everything going on. Most importantly, you'll have a clear shot when the time is right, all right?",

        "Elizabeth: Sweetheart, you don't have to worry about rafe. He's a slayer. He knows what he's doing. And besides, even if he could get rid of stephen -- caleb it'd be a wonderful thing for a lot of people.",
        "Alison: Mother, I know it would mean a lot to you to have him gone, and I want him gone just as much as the next person --",
        "elizabeth: I know, but you're still concerned.",
        "Alison: I know he's an experienced slayer -- I know that -- but he's also the man I love.",
        "Elizabeth: I know, and think how wonderful your life will be with him if caleb were out of the picture forever.",
        "Rafe: Alison. Alison!",
        "Alison: My god, rafe, it is you. Wait. Rafe! Rafe! Rafe! Rafe!",
        "Rafe: They sent me back! Whoo! They sent me back to be with you! Caleb is back because I'm back. Good and evil, they had to balance. They always will.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison? Sweetie? Are you ok? You look like you just saw a ghost.",
        "Alison: I'm fine.",
        "Elizabeth: Are you sure?",
        "Alison: Yeah. You're -- you're right, mother. Life with rafe, without caleb, really would be a miracle.",

        "Reese: Why would you with me around?",
        "Ricky: If that wasn't enough, then cazoeoes off on him, jack gets his lights punched out, and the cops show up. I mean, what's next?",
        "Reese: I'll tell you what's next. Now that we're all alone finally, I'm going to give you your gift.",
        "Ricky: What gift?",

        "Caleb: I need some water.",
        "Tess: What you need is to let yourself feel. Let yourself be open to what's real. You can't do that while that stuff is in your system.",
        "Caleb: I can't do this, tess. I can'T.",
        "Tess: Yes, you can. Please, stephen, try and connect to that place de inside your heart and your soul that's longing for a different life, longing to live a normal human existence.",

        "Ian: He's starting to crack.",
        "Rafe: That's the idea.",
        "Lucy: Right, but we still need jack. For him to be completely vulnerable, we need e music box and we need livvie.",
