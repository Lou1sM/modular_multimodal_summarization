        "Eve: Well, I haven't seen anybody eat that fast since -- since a friend of \r\nmine polished off three sloppy joes in the hospital cafeteria. ",
        "Woman: I'm back. ",
        "Eve: Oh, hey. That didn't take long. ",
        "Woman: No. And I found everything I needed. How is our patient? ",
        "Eve: Well, he is even better than he was an hour ago, and his temperature is \r\ncompletely back to normal. ",
        "Woman: All thanks to you. ",
        "Eve: I'm happy to do it, really. So what are you rushing around doing? ",
        "Woman: I'm setting up for the celebration. ",
        "Eve: Celebration? For Kaylo? ",
        "Woman: No. You. ",
        "Eve: Me? ",
        "Woman: A huge feast to show our gratitude. ",
        "Eve: Oh, that's so sweet, but, really, you don't have to do that. ",
        "Woman: You saved my son's life. Besides, my husband will be very insulted if \r\nyou refuse. ",
        "Eve: Well, in that case, I'd be honored. But only if you let me help. ",
        "Woman: You can. Stay with Kaylo. I have so much to do yet. ",
        "Eve: Oh, well, that would be my pleasure. ",
        "Woman: You -- be a good boy. ",
        "Eve: Well, it looks like you could use some more soup. Let me get that for \r\nyou. Oh, goodness. I'm ok. I just, you know, think I'm a little tired. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Arianna: Ian. I was so worried. Where have you been? ",
        "Ian: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to worry you. ",
        "Arianna: No, I'm sorry. I have no right to ask such things. ",
        "Ian: It's ok. I went and did something I should have done a long time ago.\r\n",
        "Arianna: You went to see Ben, didn't you? ",
        "Ian: He won't bother you anymore. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: This is your pregnancy test? ",
        "Lucy: It's really none of your business. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, don't you dare try to lay that on me and then just try to walk \r\naway. ",
        "Lucy: Get out of my way, Doc. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, in your dreams. ",
        "Lucy: Let go of me, please. Please let go. Fine. What do you want? ",
        "Kevin: Is this true? Do you think you could be pregnant? ",
        "Lucy: That is usually why one buys a pregnancy test. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: You know what? It doesn't concern you. ",
        "Kevin: How can you say that -- that this doesn't concern me? Unless -- ",
        "Lucy: Unless what? ",
        "Kevin: It isn't mine, is it? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: You're right. You got me. You know what? It's not your baby. It could \r\nbe -- I don't know -- any one of a dozen guys' babies. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: No, maybe I can narrow it down, you know, to eight or nine guys. ",
        "Kevin: All right, that's enough. Look, I am sorry, but I did just catch you \r\nwith Jack not too long ago. ",
        "Lucy: Ooh. I have told you and told you and told you -- I didn't sleep with \r\nJack. ",
        "Kevin: I believe you, ok? And I am sorry, but I'm a bit in shock right now. I \r\nmean, you being pregnant is the last thing I expected. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, you're not the only one. ",
        "Kevin: To think that you and I -- we -- could be having a baby -- ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Well, how did this happen? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. ",
        "Kevin: Look, let me rephrase that. ",
        "Lucy: Look, Doc, we both know how this happened. ",
        "Kevin: I mean, we were careful. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, we were very careful. But sometimes careful isn't 100% effective, \r\nright? And so I guess the only thing that's really effective is abstinence, and \r\nwe haven't exactly been participating in that, have we? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know what to say. I mean, let's face it -- you and I are not \r\nexactly in the best place for this right now. ",
        "Lucy: Well, please, you know, don't let it trouble you. ",
        "Kevin: Excuse me? ",
        "Lucy: If I'm pregnant -- which is a great, big if -- it doesn't really \r\nchange anything. ",
        "Kevin: It doesn't change anything? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You know, I mean between us. ",
        "Kevin: So let me get this straight. What you're proposing is one of these \r\nmodern arrangements where we share custody, alternate weekends, trade holidays?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Maybe we're just getting a little bit -- the cart before the horse \r\nhere, right? ",
        "Kevin: No, no, we should just wait until the baby's here. ",
        "Lucy: Let's wait and see if there really is a baby, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Well, you must be pretty sure or you wouldn't have bought that test.\r\n",
        "Lucy: You know what? Just -- you don't worry yourself about it. I can handle \r\nit, ok? You don't have to be any part of this. ",
        "Kevin: Is that so? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that's -- look, I know how you feel about me -- or let me correct \r\nthat. I know, rather, how you don't feel about me. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: I also know you're a very standup guy and you'll want to do the right \r\nthing. ",
        "Kevin: \"Do the right thing?\" ",
        "Lucy: Right. But guess what, Doc -- you don't have to. I am letting you off \r\nthe hook. ",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe that's not entirely up to you. ",
        "",
        "Ian: So there I was, looking at Joe in a pool of fake blood and your brother \r\nstanding over me with a gun. ",
        "Arianna: You could have been killed. ",
        "Ian: No. The gun had blanks in it. Anyway, I created a diversion and took the \r\ngun away from him. But before I could make a phone call saying that there was a \r\nmurder, he took off. ",
        "Arianna: Are you sure he's really gone? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. He was on the first plane out of here, and he's not coming back.\r\n",
        "Arianna: Because you set it up so he would think he was wanted for -- ",
        "Ian: For the murder of Joe Scanlon. Pretty genius stuff, that. ",
        "Arianna: My brother is really smart. You know, maybe he knew it was a trick \r\nand he was just pretending to leave. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, is that right? Frank watched him get on the plane and watched the \r\nplane take off. How smart is that? ",
        "Arianna: Well, that doesn't mean he won't come back. ",
        "Ian: I saw him take off. He was pretty scared. And I don't think he's coming \r\nback, no. ",
        "Arianna: You know, if he ever finds out that it was you who staged this whole \r\nthing -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, he won't. I was careful. ",
        "Arianna: Careful? There's no careful when you're dealing with Ben. What were \r\nyou thinking? ",
        "Ian: I was thinking you'd be happier than this. ",
        "Arianna: I am happy, and I am so grateful, really, for everything you've done \r\nfor me. ",
        "Ian: What's the matter? You still worried? ",
        "Arianna: If Ben finds out, he'll be more dangerous than ever. And next time, \r\nhe'll be coming after you. ",
        "Ian: I told you, he won't. ",
        "Arianna: Well, how can you be so sure? But Joe isn't really dead. ",
        "Ian: No. He's alive and well and living in Port Charles, but I have a friend \r\nat the newspaper. ",
        "Arianna: This is a fake? ",
        "Ian: Yes, it's a fake. It's good, right? Anyway, I'm going to send it to your \r\nbrother, along with a note saying that if he ever sets foot in this country \r\nagain, the authorities will be waiting for him. ",
        "Arianna: How can I ever thank you? ",
        "Ian: I just want you to know that this is over. ",
        "Arianna: Yeah. Yes, I guess it is. ",
        "Ian: All right, what is it? ",
        "Arianna: Well, now that Ben is gone, I guess you want me to go so you can be \r\nwith Eve. ",
        "",
        "Man: So, what do you think? ",
        "Eve: I think this is a really wonderful celebration. I feel very spoiled. ",
        "Man: And yet, compared to what you gave us -- ",
        "Eve: Seeing your son's smile is thanks enough for me. ",
        "Man: Even so, I owe you a great debt. Please accept this gift as a small \r\ntoken of my most sincere appreciation. ",
        "Eve: It's beautiful. ",
        "Man: Amongst our people, it's the symbol of loyalty. I carved it from stone \r\nmyself so you'd always have a reminder of our feeling of loyalty towards you. \r\nDr. Lambert? ",
        "Woman: Eve, are you all right? ",
        "Eve: I'm fine. I think I just need to get a little bit of air. ",
        "Woman: Yes, it's very hot in here. I'll go with you. ",
        "Eve: No, it's ok. You don't -- ",
        "",
        "Ian: So you think I did this to get rid of you? ",
        "Arianna: It was such a huge risk. You're obviously very anxious to get your \r\nfreedom back, and I completely understand that. ",
        "Ian: Wait, wait, wait. When you saw me kissing Eve outside the Recovery Room \r\nthat night, I was -- ",
        "Arianna: You had every right. It is none of my -- ",
        "Ian: It shouldn't have happened. And I promise it won't happen again. ",
        "Arianna: Why? Especially now when I'm out of danger? ",
        "Ian: Well, you're not out of danger. If the INS finds out that this marriage \r\nisn't real, they're going to deport you right back to your brother's house. ",
        "Arianna: Ian, you don't have to do this. I know how much you want to be with \r\nEve. ",
        "Ian: I made a promise, and I'm sticking to it. End of story. ",
        "Arianna: So we're just going to be on pretending to be this happy couple? ",
        "Ian: We can't let our guard down, not even for a second. So I picked \r\nsomething up today. ",
        "Arianna: What is it? ",
        "Ian: Something very essential that we forgot. If you don't like yours, you \r\ncan exchange it. ",
        "Arianna: It's perfect. Your turn. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Where is he? Is he here yet? ",
        "Woman: Is who here? ",
        "Eve: He said he would come back for me. He loves me. ",
        "Woman: Shh. Try and rest. You need to save your strength. We'll take care of \r\nyou, my dear. Just close your eyes now and rest. ",
        "Man: This is just what I was afraid of. ",
        "Woman: It's done now. She has the fever, and it's hit her very hard -- even \r\nharder than our son. ",
        "Man: It's because she's an outsider with none of the natural immunities Kaylo \r\nhas. ",
        "Woman: She gave us the most precious of gifts, and now it's cost her her \r\nlife. But there is one thing we can give back to her. ",
        "Man: No. ",
        "Woman: We owe her. You said so yourself. ",
        "Man: But not the morca. It's far too powerful. If she isn't prepared \r\n-- ",
        "Woman: But if she's going to die, she deserves to know that whatever love \r\nlives in her heart need not die along with her. ",
        "Man: No. I know how much you want this for her, Maya. ",
        "Maya: But you heard her talk about her love and how she longs to see him. ",
        "Man: But we both know our ways are not for outsiders. Now, I've called for \r\nthe healer. Kaylo no longer needs him, but maybe he can help her. ",
        "Maya: But you don't really think so. ",
        "Man: Perhaps he can make her more comfortable. ",
        "Maya: We'll need some more water. ",
        "Man: I'll have some brought. ",
        "Maya: Don't worry. I won't let you die without knowing what is possible. If \r\nyou can see what was, you will realize what can be. This is not the end, but \r\njust the completion of another passage. ",
        "Maya: May the visions that call on you bring peace and revelation. May they \r\ncomfort you from this world into the next. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I have made my decision. ",
        "Kevin: And what makes you think you get to call all the shots? ",
        "Lucy: I'm not going to argue with you about this. ",
        "Kevin: And I'm not going to stand here while you say in one breath what a \r\nwonderful father I am and in the next breath try to cut me out of what could be \r\nour child's life. Why would you do that, Lucy? Why would you try to shut me out?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Because I'm afraid. ",
        "Kevin: Of what? ",
        "Lucy: Of wanting this baby so badly and wanting -- ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: Wanting to share it all with you. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I wish I knew what this baby could mean for us, but to be \r\nhonest, I don't know. But I do know that I want it to be true just as much as \r\nyou do. ",
        "Lucy: You do? ",
        "Kevin: I haven't forgotten -- I haven't forgotten. ",
        "Lucy: We wanted so much to be parents together. ",
        "Kevin: I still think we'd have one hell of a kid. ",
        "Lucy: I don't want to listen to this anymore because it might not be true, \r\nyou know. ",
        "Kevin: But what if it is? ",
        "Lucy: I can't. Just can't take the disappointment. I don't want to get my \r\nhopes up like that. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, since when have you ever been afraid of hope? ",
        "Lucy: Since now because this could be my very last chance to have this \r\nhappen. So you know what? Let's not talk about it. I can't talk about it \r\nanymore. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no. Listen, we're at the hospital. Why don't we just go see \r\nNancy Neumann and we can find out for sure. ",
        "Lucy: No. No -- Doc, no. I can't. I can't go sit in that office again and sit \r\nthere waiting to find out if my dreams are going to come true or if my dreams \r\nare just going to be dashed like that. I can't do it. ",
        "Kevin: Are you saying that you don't want to know? ",
        "Lucy: No, I don't want to know right now. I can't because right now not \r\nknowing gives me hope. There's that little piece of hope, and I've got to hold \r\non to that. I can't let that go. Not yet. Not yet.",

        "Arianna: Hey. I made you a corned beef sandwich. Just the way you like it -- \r\nextra corned beef, extra mustard. ",
        "Ian: I told you you don't have to keep doing things for me. ",
        "Arianna: But it's just -- ",
        "Ian: It's not necessary. ",
        "Arianna: What I was going to say is that it's just a sandwich and half of it \r\nis for me. ",
        "Ian: I'm -- I'm sorry. I've had a rough day. ",
        "Arianna: No. It's because you can't handle anyone doing anything nice for \r\nyou. ",
        "Ian: I don't think that's true. When I was younger -- ",
        "Arianna: Then why can't I bring you a sandwich? Or throw in your clothes when \r\nI'm doing my wash? Or just say \"thank you\" when -- ",
        "Ian: I'm not used to other people doing things for me. ",
        "Arianna: Because you've always been alone. But you're not anymore. And I \r\nwould like to be just a little more than just an inconvenience around here. ",
        "Ian: Come on, you're not an inconvenience. ",
        "Arianna: We both know that if not for me, your life would be different. ",
        "Ian: What are you trying to do, ease your conscience? ",
        "Arianna: Yes, but it's more than that. It also makes me feel a little more \r\nlike a friend. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Oh, just for the record, I'm a grown man. I don't eat half a \r\nsandwich. ",
        "Arianna: Oh, I forgot drinks. Can I get you a soda or a beer? ",
        "Ian: Beer is fine, thank you. ",
        "Ian: Hey. I know we're not supposed to see each other, but I just wanted to \r\ncall and leave a message and tell you I'm thinking about you. I love you, \r\nLambert. I always will. ",

        "Kevin: Maybe I can help. ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, you don't understand. I -- I -- I can't do this. I'm having \r\nenough trouble taking care of my own fears, but if I have to look in your face \r\nand see maybe hope, I can't take that. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I do understand. And I need -- I need your help, too. Yes, I \r\nneed your help, I think, as much as you need mine. Maybe we need each other more \r\nthan we ever have. So please open the door. ",
