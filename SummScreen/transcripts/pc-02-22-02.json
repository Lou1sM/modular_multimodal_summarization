        "Ian: I thought maybe we should finish the talk we started earlier. ",
        "Amy: The one about our mutual, albeit harmless, attraction? Or the one about \r\nmy oh-so-mysterious past? ",
        "Ian: Maybe a little of both. ",
        "Amy: I thought we said everything that needs to be said on the first topic.\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, our relationship's gotten a little complicated. As far as \r\nharmless, I don't -- ",
        "Amy: Ian, what are you trying to say? ",
        "Ian: Well, there's a couple of things that I haven't been completely honest \r\nabout. ",
        "Amy: Oh? ",
        "Ian: So I thought maybe we could sit down, just the two of us, and talk. ",
        "Amy: All right, let's talk. ",
        "Ian: Not here. ",
        "Amy: Where do you want to go? ",
        "Ian: We'll go someplace where people aren't going to interrupt us. What do \r\nyou say? ",
        "Amy: This does indeed sound very serious. ",
        "Ian: Will you go with me? ",
        "Amy: Lead the way. ",
        "Man's Voice: There aren't any fingerprints on this cup. ",
        "Ian's Voice: What are you talking about? I saw a woman holding it. ",
        "Man's Voice: Look, I don't know what you saw, Doc, but no human hand has \r\ntouched this. ",

        "Paige: I knew it, Kevin. I knew it from the first moment I saw you again. It \r\nwas still there -- everything I ever felt. ",
        "Kevin: Paige -- ",
        "Paige: I prayed that you felt the same way, but I didn't dare hope, but you \r\ndo, don't you? You do, and you can't deny it any more than I can. ",
        "Kevin: No, no -- Paige, Paige, stop, no. We can't do this. ",

        "Rafe: You want to run that by me again? You said you want to have a baby? ",
        "Alison: Your baby. Yours and mine. Rafe, listen to me -- I know that this \r\nsounds crazy, ok, and I know that this doesn't even come close to being \r\npractical, but, Rafe, let's face it, I mean, you and I together are anything but \r\npractical, and yet here we are. Somehow it was our destiny for us to find each \r\nother and to fall in love. And I just don't think that God would want to go \r\nthrough all of this work for us just to break us apart so soon and be left with \r\nnothing but a bunch of memories. ",
        "Rafe: Angel -- ",
        "Alison: No, listen to me -- I can see it so clearly. Ok, somehow, someway, \r\nour having a child is what's meant to be. Please tell me that you see that, too.\r\n",

        "Ricky: Yeah, of course she's still alive. Why do you sound so surprised? And \r\nwhat is this about a fifth chair? ",
        "Casey: Oh, well -- no, no, no. See, first of all, I'm not surprised, ok? I \r\njust -- you -- you scared me, you know, coming in here all unannounced. I \r\nthought -- anyway, fifth chair -- it's just this expression back where I'm from. \r\nIt's kind of like, you know, \"bought the farm,\" \"bit it\" -- ",
        "Ricky: Ok, ok, I get it. ",
        "Casey: Yeah. So, what are you doing here if it's not about your sister? ",
        "Ricky: I came to talk to you about why you ran off the other day. ",
        "Casey: Ran off? ",
        "Ricky: Yes. You know, when we were in the alley? ",
        "Casey: Oh, that. ",
        "Ricky: Yes, that. You know, as I recall, you pretty much jumped me, then you \r\ngot both of us nice and worked up, and -- poof -- you were gone. ",
        "Casey: Well, maybe I just didn't want to do it in an alley. ",

        "Kevin: I do care about you. I do care. And all those memories I have of us \r\ntogether are wonderful. They're incredible. But that's all they are are memories \r\nof what once was when we were kids. Paige, what's real now is my marriage to \r\nLucy. ",
        "Paige: No. No, you must still love me, or you wouldn't have said all those \r\nthings you did just now about our past and what we shared together. ",
        "Kevin: No, Paige -- ",
        "Paige: No, no, it was more than that. It was more than just reliving old \r\ntimes. You remembered every detail, every moment, just as I did, as though \r\nlonging with your whole heart and soul to return to those days, as though \r\nconjuring them up in your mind could somehow make them real again. ",
        "Kevin: Paige, you're reading things into this. I am a married man. ",
        "Paige: Yes, and you care about Lucy. I realize that. But you can't let me go. \r\nEver since I got here, every time I've tried to leave, you've stopped me. You've \r\ndone everything in your power to make me stay. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry if you misinterpreted that, Paige. ",
        "Paige: Misinterpreted? How could I misinterpret the man I know so well? I can \r\nsee it in your eyes, Kevin. I can hear it in your voice. It's still there. Maybe \r\nyou're not ready to admit it to yourself or to me. I understand that. You're \r\nconfused. ",
        "Kevin: No, Paige -- ",
        "Paige: You're confused because you can't forget these feelings. I can't \r\nforget them, either. I still have these same feelings -- feelings that will \r\nnever go away no matter how many years go by because you know me, my love -- my \r\nheart, my mind, everything about me, inside and out. ",

It doesn't \r\nmean that I'm not still going to be with you forever. I mean, maybe not in the \r\nphysical sense, but in your heart and everywhere and everywhere you go. All \r\nyou're going to have to do is close your eyes and just know it and believe it \r\nand -- ",

        "Alison: I know, but I would be a really good mother. ",
        "Rafe: No, you would be the best mother. I don't have a doubt in my mind about \r\nthat, but what are you going to tell this kid about his father? Or her. Her \r\nfather. That -- that the father was just some kind of wayward angel that fell \r\nfrom the sky and just split one day? It's going to be kind of hard to explain.\r\n",
        "Alison: I would tell him that his father was the most amazing, gentle, the \r\nkindest man I've ever known and that he was here for way too short of a time and \r\nhe was now up in heaven. ",

        "Rafe: You're thinking with your heart and not about how difficult this is \r\ngoing to be. ",
        "Alison: I know, I know, but that's what you taught me to do. And it's telling \r\nme that this is the right thing to do, and so is my head. I believe so strongly \r\nthat I am made to keep this connection with you and that raising our child would \r\nnever be a burden but the most amazing blessing and the most wonderful miracle \r\nsince meeting his father.

        "Rafe: No, you -- you are the miracle. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, ok, listen to me -- you also once told me that I made all of \r\nyour dreams come true, but that -- that's not so. ",
        "Rafe: Yes, it is. How can you say that? ",
        "Alison: No, it's not because -- listen, you told me that you also wanted a \r\nfamily and a home and you wanted those things with me. Rafe, it's not too late. \r\nI can still give you those things through our child, ok? It's not too late, and \r\nsoon that dream -- it will be lost to both of us. Ok, please, just think about \r\nit, ok? You've always said that you being here, there's a reason for that and \r\nfor us finding each other and falling in love. What if this is it? What if we \r\nare meant to do this? ",
