        "Jamal: So how's it coming, Spunky? ",
        "Alison: Coming? We're almost done. We've been doing this since dawn. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, if we keep busting our butts, the place will be open on time, \r\nright? ",
        "Alison: Life's good, huh, Jamal? ",
        "Jamal: Yep, and it keeps getting better and better and better and better and \r\nbetter and better and better. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Jamal: Better if we keep getting up early and staying at it. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, did you want me to get that for you? ",
        "Jamal: You know, hey, you're closest, you know, so -- ",
        "Alison: Am now. Jamal's Bike Shop. We are almost open. This is Alison. Hello?\r\n",
        "Jamal: Is there a problem? ",
        "Alison: Oh, they hung up. ",
        "Jamal: You told them we weren't open. ",
        "Alison: So? They still could've said something. ",
        "Jamal: People are weird, ok? What can I tell you? ",
        "Alison: About being weird? Not a whole lot, sorry. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Jamal: See? Some fiber optic problem right there. They heard you and you \r\ndidn't hear them. ",
        "[Ring] ",
        "Alison: Jamal's Bike Shop. This is Alison. Hello? Hello? Somebody? Hello? ",
        "Jamal: Yo, Ali. ",

        "Eve: Cold. ",
        "Maya: You're on fire still. We've sent for a healer for you. ",
        "[Eve moans] ",
        "Maya: But if it is your time, please know you were loved. You were loved. ",
        "Ian: Any help for a weary soldier? ",
        "Eve: Is it true? ",
        "Ian: Thank God. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh, you're here. You've come. ",
        "Ian: I would've moved heaven and earth. ",
        "Eve: I missed you so much. I thought I'd never see you again. ",
        "Ian: Nothing can keep me from you. Not the war, not the end of the world, not \r\ndeath itself. Nothing. Nothing. ",
        "Eve: Nothing. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Can I get you anything? ",
        "Lucy: Like what? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. I'd just like to do something besides stand around and \r\ntake up space. Or make empty small talk just to make the quiet seem less -- \r\nquiet. ",
        "Lucy: Nope. I guess it's just, um, zero hour. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'll just pace aimlessly, I guess. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, yeah, well, you know, go ahead. Do whatever it takes because it's \r\njust going to take a minute, you know, and then we'll know for sure that I'm not \r\npregnant. ",
        "Kevin: Not? ",
        "Lucy: Not. Not. That's what I said. I am not. We'll know that I'm not. ",

        "",
        "Jamal: Nothing, huh? ",
        "Alison: No. I star-69'd it, but -- ",
        "Jamal: \"The number of your last call is unavailable.\" Blah, blah, blah. ",
        "Alison: I know, I hate that. It, like, never works. ",
        "Jamal: I know. ",
        "Alison: And meanwhile, whoever that was is deliberately blocking that so that \r\nI can't figure out who it is. I hate that. ",
        "Jamal: All right, slow down, slow down. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: The next time the phone rings, I'll get it. Ok? ",
        "Alison: All right. ",
        "Jamal: But seriously, you got to figure on a lot of kinks coming up like this \r\nplace, you know? I mean, that's how it is getting a new business off the ground.\r\n",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Jamal: Plus, you never know who had the number before us. ",
        "Alison: All right, I think I'm just, like, a little jumpy because of all \r\nthese paint fumes. It's so strong. It's, like, burning my eyes. ",
        "Jamal: Well, we've been at it for 14 hours. ",
        "Alison: I know. Look, I said that I wanted to just keep working through, but \r\ndo you want to take a break? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. You know, a little fresh air sounds like exactly what we need.\r\n",
        "Alison: Yeah, it does. ",
        "Jamal: How's a little wind in your hair and a little highway under your feet \r\nsound, hmm? ",
        "Alison: What did you have in mind? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I finished working on that work that guy brought in last week. \r\nFigure we'd take it out for a nice little test run. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: You in the mood or what? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Jack: Knock, knock, knock. What's up, guys? ",
        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Big J. ",
        "Jack: How you doing? ",
        "Jamal: What's up, boy? ",
        "Jack: Just thought I'd come by and see what kind of trouble you guys are \r\ngetting into. Place looks pretty cool, though. ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, just wait until it really gets going. ",
        "Jack: So you guys need any help? ",
        "Alison: As a matter of fact -- ",
        "Jamal: Oh, dude, do you mind keeping an eye on this place while we take a \r\nlittle ride, man, clear some cobwebs? ",
        "Jack: No, no, not a problem at all. ",
        "Alison: Oh, cool. ",
        "Jack: Give me a chance to inspect it. ",
        "Alison: Oh, right on. Sweet thing. Now, listen, if you see anything that, \r\nlike, needs to be done, feel free, please, because I know that you're just so \r\nhandy and all, you know, that you could probably do that. Thanks. ",
        "Jack: All right, Alison. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, yo, sure you're going to be cool, man? ",
        "Jack: Hey, let her go, and don't come back until those ears of yours are \r\nfrozen. ",
        "Jamal: Cool. Thanks. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Jamal: Oh -- leave this open, let the fumes air out and everything, all \r\nright? ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Jamal: Cool. ",
        "Jack: This is not bad. Not bad at all. ",

        "Man: Maya? ",
        "Maya: Has the healer come? ",
        "Man: Not yet. ",
        "Maya: If he isn't here soon -- ",
        "Man: She dreams. ",
        "Maya: I pray with all my heart her dreams are happy ones. ",
        "Man: You did more than pray. You gave her the morca. ",
        "Maya: I did. ",
        "Man: After telling you not to, against my word? ",
        "Maya: We have a debt to her. She saved our son. I had to do what I could for \r\nher. ",
        "Man: Morca will not save her life. ",
        "Maya: I know. But it works its mysterious way in her now as it should. The \r\nmorca has taken her back to a happier time in another life where she can \r\npass with a lighter heart. ",
        "Eve: This feels like a dream, but I know it's real. You've found your way \r\nback. ",
        "Ian: How could I not after the promise I made you? ",
        "Eve: I never lost hope. I made all the arrangements you asked for. We can be \r\nmarried next week. ",
        "Ian: Next week? ",
        "Eve: What's wrong? ",
        "Ian: I don't have a week. ",
        "Eve: How long do you have? ",
        "Ian: Just a few days and then I've got to get back. I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: No. No, don't apologize. I know it's not your fault. ",
        "Ian: But I promised we'd spend time together. ",
        "Eve: You're here right now, and that's all I need. ",
        "Ian: I hate this bloody war. I hate anything that keeps me from you. I'm only \r\nhalf alive without you in my arms. I love you more than life. More than life.\r\n",
        "Eve: More than life. I love you, too. So much. ",

        "Lucy: Doc? I told you, no surprises. ",
        "Kevin: You mean you're -- you're not? ",
        "Lucy: No. No. No. I'm not, no. Of course not. I -- I didn't really believe. \r\nYou know, I wasn't really thinking I could actually be pregnant. Oh, my God, I'm \r\nnot. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm -- I'm just not. I'm -- I'm not. I'm not.\r\n",

        "Eve: To us. ",
        "Ian: I fell in love with you here. ",
        "Eve: No matter how far apart we are, I know that I can come back to this \r\nplace and close my eyes and feel you right beside me. ",
        "Ian: I will always love you. Remember that. Whatever happens to me -- ",
        "Eve: Shh! When this war is over, we're going to be married just like we \r\nplanned. ",
        "Ian: But if something went wrong -- ",
        "Eve: No! I know you'll come back to me. I know it. ",
        "Ian: Listen to me, listen -- whatever happens, you'll always be a part of me, \r\nwe'll always be together -- not just now, for always. ",
        "Eve: Always. Always. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I'm -- I'm sorry. I -- I just wish there was something more I \r\ncould say or do. Something. ",
        "Lucy: I know. But I think you also know this is all I've ever wanted in my \r\nwhole life. The only thing I really, really wanted was to carry a child of my \r\nown. ",
        "Kevin: And maybe it could still happen. ",
        "Lucy: No, shh. Please stop. ",
        "Kevin: It was just a false alarm, though, Lucy. It's still possible. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait. Is that what you think this all was -- just a false alarm?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I'm just saying that it's still possible for you to become pregnant \r\none day. ",
        "Lucy: With whom? Who would be the father? You? Doc, come on, every time we've \r\nmade love, it just feels like a great big -- ",
        "Kevin: What? Like a what? ",
        "Lucy: Like a mistake. We always feel so guilty and we end up apologizing to \r\neach other, and then we end up promising we're never going to do that again. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's true, but -- ",
        "Lucy: But nothing. What are you saying now? Are you saying that you've \r\nchanged your mind? That it's ok now? You're all right with it? That we can do \r\nahead and make that -- ooh -- that terrible, awful mistake again? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you know how much you mean to me. ",
        "Lucy: And you know how much this means to me. So, Doc, let's just do it, \r\nshall we? Let's just do it right now and get it over with. I'm ready. Are you \r\nready? Come on, help my lifetime dream come true. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please, don't do this. ",
        "Lucy: Don't? You don't want to? Is that what you're saying? So I misread you. \r\nYou're not willing to be the father. Ok, let me see -- so you want me to look \r\nfor other candidates? Maybe you can help me do that. Better yet, I'll save you \r\nthe time. Maybe I'm just going to call Jack, you know? Maybe we'll go all the \r\nway this time. That might be kind of fun! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you made your point. ",
        "Lucy: What point? Is the point that you don't want me now to have sex with \r\nsomebody else? Is that what -- you're right, you don't like this idea. Ok, let \r\nme see. Maybe we can do this without actually having sex. I know -- I'll go to a \r\nsperm bank, your local handy sperm bank and then -- you can be there, too. You \r\nknow, us together. Then you can actually be a part of this. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please stop this! ",
        "Lucy: What? Stop what? Stop getting angry? Stop being hurt? Stop \r\nlosing control? I can't, Doc, because it's your turn. It's your turn to stop \r\nthis! I want you -- you -- to stop all of this right now! ",
        "",
        "Jamal: So how about it, Spunky? You ready to see what this baby can do? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me one second. I got to get zipped up \r\nhere. It's freezing. ",
        "Jamal: I will keep you warm. You just hold on tight to me, ok? All right, \r\nplus the air feels great rushing by on a night like this, trust me. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, you trust me, unless you want me to get pneumonia.\r\n",
        "Jamal: All right, all right, all right. Zip up. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. At least somebody's got to plan ahead here. ",
        "Jamal: Well, let's say we make it both of us. Ok, our resolution's starting \r\ntonight. From here on out, we look to the future, no looking back. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, that sounds good to me. Only -- ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Alison: Travis. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, what about him? ",
        "Alison: Well, Jamal, I mean, you said that you would drive his getaway car \r\nand then backed out at the last second. I mean, he got shot, he got arrested.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Yeah, he doesn't have any beef with me. I told him the deal was off \r\nbefore it even got started. Sweetie, the minute I found out they were carrying \r\nguns, me saying no was all legit. ",
        "Alison: Are you sure? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm sure of this much -- Travis is looking at a gray-striped \r\nfuture, and ours is every color in the rainbow, baby. Stop looking back, all \r\nright? Pretty soon you and I are going to be running the biggest, best bike shop \r\nPort Charles has ever seen. ",
        "Alison: Wait, I'm sorry -- \"we?\" ",
        "Jamal: Ok, look, you weren't going to help me get this place open for \r\nbusiness and then cut out on me, were you, huh? ",
        "Alison: No. No. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. ",
        "Alison: But are you sure you, like, want me around that much? ",
        "Jamal: Look, there is nothing I want more. Only if this is, you know, what \r\nyou want. I don't know. ",
        "Alison: No, yeah, you know? I could, like, answer the phones and -- I don't \r\nknow -- do whatever else you want me to do, sir. ",
        "Jamal: Well, consider yourself hired. Only first you got to learn a thing or \r\ntwo about motorcycles, you know, so you know how to talk to our customers. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Starting with riding one? ",
        "Jamal: You ready to learn? ",
        "Alison: Wait, you mean like drive this myself? ",
        "Jamal: With me as your teacher, you will be fine. You have nothing to worry \r\nabout -- not about this bike, Travis, nothing, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok, if you say so. ",
        "Jamal: Everything is cool, Spunky. You just stick with me, all right? \r\nEverything is going our way. ",

        "Man: Place ain't even open yet. ",
        "Second Man: Yeah, and nobody's supposed to be in here. ",
        "Jack: Well, then what are you two guys doing in here, huh? Who the heck are \r\nyou? ",
        "Man: That's none of your business. ",
        "Jack: Oh. No, see, you just made it my business. A friend of mine owns this \r\nplace and he asked me to look after it. ",
        "Man: Yeah, well, we got business of our own here to take care of, so get \r\nlost. ",

        "Lucy: I know what you're trying to do, Doc. You're trying to pat me on the \r\nhead and calm me down and tell me, \"Yeah, you could get pregnant again. You can \r\ncarry a child of your own that you've always wanted, and maybe you can even \r\ncarry the -- the child that we always wanted.\" But, Doc, all you're doing -- \r\ndon't you see? All you're doing is -- is just making this harder! ",
        "Kevin: Then you need to tell me how. ",
        "Lucy: How? How? First, you could just stop making me believe that there's \r\nsomething that could happen between us with a baby involved, that I could have a \r\nchild, because it's not happening in my life. I mean, with or without you in my \r\nlife, that doesn't seem to be a part of it. But I can't help hoping. You know, a \r\nlittle teeny excuse happens and I'm off again, I'm thinking, \"Maybe this time.\" \r\nBut my God, this time I really did believe it. My hopes were way up here. I \r\nthought, \"This is it, I'm finally carrying a child, our -- our child, after all \r\nthese years.\" ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, don't you think I know this hurts? ",
        "Lucy: But you don't know how much. My dreams, my whole lifetime dream \r\n-- overnight, I could create it on the tiniest little excuse. ",
        "Kevin: You need to tell me what to do. How can I help? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. All I know is how you can't help. You can't help me by \r\ntelling me that we have a future. Especially don't tell me we have a future as a \r\nfamily because I know that something will go wrong next week, next month -- \r\nsometime I'm going to do something or say something wrong and then I get it \r\nagain. I get that roller coaster speech or the \"Why do you always do and say \r\nsomething wrong?\" Or maybe that speech, \"Lucy, you are so stupid for \r\ntrusting in your ridiculous universe.\" ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, that's not true, and you know it. Now, please stop. ",
        "Lucy: That's the word. That's the word right there -- \"stop.\" That is what \r\nI'm trying to do. Don't you see? I have to stop all of this because I can't take \r\nit anymore. I swear I can't. You keep telling me you hate being with me \r\nsometimes because it's like a roller coaster. Get off, Doc. Just get off of it, \r\nok? Turn in your pass, rip up your tickets, just get off of the rides! They're \r\nclosed! I am taking this whole thing and shutting it down once and for all, \r\nforever, finished! It is over between us, and you need to go right now. Just go \r\nout that door and don't look back and don't wonder about me, don't worry about \r\nme, and please, for God's sakes, don't you give a damn about me. No, no, no. ",
