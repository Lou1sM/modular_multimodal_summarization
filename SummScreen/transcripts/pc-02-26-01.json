        "Jamal: Yeah, right -- ta-da. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jamal: Turn the motor off. ",
        "Alison: Was I great, or was I great, or I was I great? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you were great, you were great. Don't forget the kickstand now.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Have you ever in your life seen a better first-time \r\ndriver? ",
        "[Jamal laughs] ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Even when I kind of, like, sideswiped those garbage cans, \r\nyou know, I still kept us nice and steady. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, a few more lessons and you'll be a regular Hell's Angel. ",
        "Alison: That's because I have you for a teacher. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Ow. Ow. Ouch. Oh. Give me a kiss. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you know, we'd better head back, you know, before we do some \r\nreal damage. ",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, ok. Cool. All right. ",
        "Alison: What? What? ",
        "Jamal: I still haven't gotten used to it, you know? I mean, having a shop to \r\nget back to, you know? ",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. Your own shop. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Ours. ",
        "Alison: I never knew that going to work can feel this good, you know? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, come on. Let's see how Jack's holding down the fort. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Jack: You got about three seconds to get the hell out of here. ",
        "Man: Man, we ain't done leaving Travis' message yet. ",
        "Jack: Oh, no. I'm afraid you are. ",
        "Man: Oh, relax, bro. Stop tweaking so hard, man. ",
        "Second Man: Yeah, you wouldn't want to bust a gut. ",
        "Livvie: Jack! Stop them! ",
        "Chris: Stay back. ",
        "Man: Let's bounce, man. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Jack! Oh, my God. Are you ok? ",
        "Chris: You just can't stay out of trouble, can you? ",
        "",
        "Arianna: Thank you for the offer, Mrs. -- Mary. And -- no, we'll do it as \r\nsoon as Ian gets back. No, it's ok. I don't mind being alone. I will. Bye. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, it's just me. ",
        "Arianna: Hey, Gabriela. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm sorry. I knocked, and I heard you say something, and I thought \r\nyou were telling me to come in, so -- ",
        "Arianna: That's ok. I shouldn't be so jumpy. I thought you might be -- ",
        "Gabriela: You thought I was Ben. ",
        "Arianna: I know he's out of the country. I just can't stop feeling this way.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Hey, you know, it's going to take you a while to feel safe. ",
        "Arianna: Well, I can't keep holding on to this. Neil used to sleep with it, \r\nand he loaned it to me. ",
        "Gabriela: He's cute. Although, I can see where it would be impractical. ",
        "Arianna: Very. ",
        "Gabriela: So you lean on me instead. ",
        "Arianna: You? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. That's why I'm here, actually. Ian called me, told me to come \r\nkeep you company till he gets back. ",
        "Arianna: He did? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, so I brought some music. We have some boring soothing stuff \r\n-- blah, blah, blah -- and then, when we're done with that, Metallica. ",
        "Arianna: Uh -- you know, Gabriela, when you were talking to Ian, did he \r\nhappen to mention how long he'd be gone for? ",
        "Gabriela: Trying to get rid of me already, huh? ",
        "Arianna: No. No, no, no, no. It's just -- ",
        "Gabriela: I know, I know. I'm just teasing. And I wish I had an answer for \r\nyou, but Ian didn't know himself. He just said he was going to stay as long as \r\nhe was needed.",

        "Eve: No. No. This is wrong. This is a mistake. ",
        "Woman: I wish it were. ",
        "Eve: My fianc\u00e9 would never leave me. ",
        "Woman: I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: No. No, no, no. He's coming back for me. He said when the fighting \r\nstops, he would come back to me, and then we'd -- we'd -- ",
        "Woman: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh, God. No. No. No. Oh, no. Oh -- ",

        "Ian: Eve. Eve. Eve, can you hear me? It's me, Ian. Eve? ",
        "Man: You know this woman? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. What I don't know is what she's doing here. ",
        "Maya: No, you mustn't touch her anymore. The virus -- ",
        "Ian: Get me some cloths. And water -- cold water. Lambert, wake up. Wake up. \r\nDon't you think of leaving me. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. No, no. As far as I can tell, they didn't take anything -- \r\njust trashed the place. Uh-huh. Right, all right. Yeah, I'll be here. Bye. Oh, \r\nwait -- I guess you need to send an ambulance, too. ",
        "Livvie: Hey. Is it just your shoulder? I mean, are you hurt anywhere else? \r\nJack, what happened? Why did they do this to you? ",
        "Jack: Wrong place, wrong time, I guess. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, you just -- you just sit still and try not to move, ok? ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey. I'm all right, all right? You and your boyfriend don't have \r\nto stick around. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm not going anywhere. ",
        "Jack: Ow. Then I will. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, no. Chris -- Chris, you can't just let him walk out of here.\r\n",
        "Chris: Well, if Jack doesn't want help -- ",
        "Livvie: But he's hurt! Please, Chris, you have to help him. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Here you go. You like tea, don't you? ",
        "Arianna: Yeah. We used to have it every day at home. At 4:00, just like the \r\nBritish. My father liked it for the tradition, and mother just liked having the \r\nwhole family together. ",
        "Gabriela: You must miss them a lot. ",
        "Arianna: My mother, my sister. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, maybe with some time and some distance, your brother will \r\ncome around, convince the rest of them to do the same. ",
        "Arianna: Ben has expectations for me, and he'll never give up on them. I'm \r\nsure of it. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, you never know. I mean, he did leave the country. He wouldn't \r\nhave done that if he was intent on controlling you. ",
        "Arianna: He only left the country because he thought he killed Joe. ",
        "Gabriela: He what? ",
        "Arianna: I don't mean that literally. I mean it -- like, I guess I do mean \r\nit. ",
        "Gabriela: Arianna, tell me what's going on right now. ",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry. I guess -- I just thought Joe would have told you about \r\n-- what did Ian call it? -- the sting. ",
        "Gabriela: Why am I not liking the sound of this? ",
        "Arianna: It's really not that big of a deal. See, what happened was Ian and \r\nJoe were setting up this little shootout so Ben -- ",
        "Gabriela: \"Little shootout?\" ",
        "Arianna: Well, so Ben would think he killed Joe and panic and leave the \r\ncountry, which he did. ",
        "Gabriela: Let me get this straight. Joe Scanlon -- my Joe? -- volunteered to \r\nbe a human target? ",
        "Joe: What's this I hear about a certain beautiful lady moving in? ",
        "Gabriela: How could you be so stupid? ",
        "",
        "Ian: You know, I'm surprised at you, Lambert -- slacking off like this. \r\nThere's people here who need you. Come on, wake up. Wake up, please. ",
        "Maya: The medicine you gave her -- why isn't it working? ",
        "Ian: It will. It will. ",
        "Maya: I'll pray for her. ",
        "Man: She's an extraordinary woman, this Lambert of yours. ",
        "Ian: Oh, that she is. ",
        "Man: Risked her own life to help our son. ",
        "Ian: Do you hear that? Hey, they're singing your praises, so wake up for it. \r\nOk. I guess I'm working overtime to get her through this. ",
        "Maya: How long have you know her, Ian? ",
        "Ian: I've always known her. ",
        "Man: I feel that connection. ",
        "Ian: But I still don't know why she's here. And I'm glad she saved your son, \r\nbut why did she come here? Did she tell you? ",
        "Man: We know only that she was troubled and she was unsure of her path. She \r\nsaid she needed a quiet place to think. ",
        "Maya: She chose Tirama Island because it meant a great deal to someone she \r\ncares for deeply. Obviously that someone was you. ",
        "Ian: However much I mean to her, she -- ",
        "Man: You love her very much. ",
        "Ian: She's my life. ",
        "Man: It explains why she felt so comfortable here, so at home, from the \r\nmoment she arrived on the island. She had the same reaction as you, Ian. ",
        "Maya: I remember your first visit -- how serene you seemed, as if the \r\ntroubles of the world had disappeared. You never failed to find peace here, no \r\nmatter how many times you came, and yet -- ",
        "Ian: Yet there was something missing. And the moment I met her, I knew what \r\nthat something was. Now my destiny has a face. ",
        "Man: Yes. The face of Lambert. ",
        "Ian: Yes. ",
        "Maya: The two of you were meant to share this place. ",
        "Man: It's no accident that you were both drawn here. Eve felt that she'd come \r\nfor a reason. ",
        "Maya: She thought the reason was to save Kaylo, and I am eternally grateful \r\nthat she did. But I believe there is another reason she came. ",
        "Ian: Well, I know the reason I'm here. I'm here to save her life. ",
        "Eve: Ian. ",
        "Ian: Eve. ",
        "Eve: You came back to me. You came back. ",

        "Jack: The hell I do. ",
        "Chris: You heard him. ",
        "Livvie: So, what, are you just going to stand there until you pass out from \r\nall the pain? ",
        "Jack: No. I'm going to -- ",

        "Chris: Look, I get it. You hate me. Shut up and let me do my job. ",

        "Chris: Sorry. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, what is it? Is it broken? ",
        "Chris: No, it feels like a dislocation. ",
        "Jack: It feels like? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. All right, look, one good pull, it'll be right back in the \r\nsocket. I need you to lie down. Come on. Jack, do you want to fix this or not? \r\nLie down. I got you. ",
        "Jack: Look, I -- oh, damn. ",
        "Chris: Ok, listen. This is going to hurt like hell, ok? Relax your shoulder. \r\nRelax it. Ok, you ready? Do you hear me? This is going to hurt. ",
        "Jack: And I bet you're going to enjoy it. ",

        "Joe: Look, I don't -- I don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Gabriela: Let me give you a couple of ideas, ok? How about Ian, gun, Ben, the \r\nsting? ",
        "Joe: Oh. That. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, that. How could you put yourself at risk like that? And why \r\ndidn't you tell me about it? You know what? Never mind. I know exactly why you \r\ndidn't tell me about it. ",
        "Joe: Because I knew that this is the way that you'd react. ",
        "Gabriela: Because you knew how insane, idiotic, dumb -- ",
        "Joe: You already used that word -- you know, \"dumb,\" I mean. You used that \r\nword already. ",
        "Gabriela: This is serious, Joseph. You could have died. ",
        "Joe: Look, I wore a bullet-proof vest. ",
        "Gabriela: On your head? ",
        "Joe: We used blanks. ",
        "Gabriela: Because nothing bad ever happens with blanks, right? ",
        "Joe: Hey, hey. I'm here, aren't I? No bullet holes. ",
        "Gabriela: You know what? Fine. You know what? Fine. You go ahead and you make \r\na joke about this, but I did not stand by you, I did not agonize with you, I did \r\nnot spend sleepless nights going through this whole HIV scare with you to lose \r\nyou to some half-assed attempt at playing a hero! Damn It, Joe! You owe it to me \r\nto stay safe. You owe it to me to be here, to share your life with me. \r\nAnd I won't stand for anything less. ",
        "Joe: Wow. ",
        "Gabriela: \"Wow?\" What does that mean, \"wow?\" ",
        "Joe: I mean, I didn't know it was possible to love someone so much. Come \r\nhere. ",

        "Ian: I'm here, Lambert. I'm beside you. Eve. Eve? ",
        "Eve: They said you were dead, that I'd never see you again. But I knew you \r\ncouldn't go. I knew you'd never leave me. We have so much to see. We have a \r\nlifetime to share together. ",
        "Ian: Eve. Eve, open your eyes. Eve, stay with me. Eve, stay awake. Stay with \r\nme. For once in your life, listen to what I say. ",

        "Chris: Hey, well, thanks for coming down, boys. Next time I'll leave you \r\nsomething to do, huh? ",
        "Officer: You've given us a pretty good description. Either of these guys \r\nsound familiar to you? ",

        "Jamal: All right, cool. ",
        "Alison: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. Do I look like a ditz to \r\nyou? I know that look you just gave him means \"let's go talk in private,\" right? \r\nI know that's some code. ",
        "Jack: I tried. ",

        "Alison: Jack, I know you're sitting on something, so just spill it. ",
        "Jack: Look, this just wasn't some random free-for-all, all right? They said \r\nit was a message from some guy by the name of Travis. ",

        "Alison: Well, Jamal, this is a pretty good start. ",
        "Jamal: Baby, come on. This didn't even faze me. ",
        "Alison: Well, I mean, you must be a little freaked out. Why wouldn't you have \r\ntold the police? It's like you're trying to protect Travis. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I am not protecting Travis. Ok, if I drop a dime on somebody \r\nlike Travis, he would be back here so fast to finish what he started it'd make \r\nyour head spin. Ok, and I already like the way your head is. All right? ",
        "Alison: Are you sure, Jamal? ",
        "Jamal: What, about your head? Gets a little thick at times, but -- ",

Let it remind you \r\nof what we shared and how far we've come to be here together. There's so much we \r\nhave to see, so much we have to do. So you stay with me, ok?
