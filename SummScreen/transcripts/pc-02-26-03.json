        "As Tess brings Caleb back to life, Rafe wakes up, sensing that something is wrong. Tired of waiting for his wife, Jack rushes out to find her. While still in the shower with Lucy, Ian feels the vampire symptoms returning. Tess and Caleb kiss tenderly. After finding a cryptic note from Rafe, Alison is visited by Lucy, who's looking for Ian. Elizabeth shows up next, complaining about the return of her symptoms. After insulting Lucy's competence as a slayer, Elizabeth begs her to find a way to get rid of Caleb for good. At the crypt, Ian and Jack find Rafe staring at an empty slab. Jack worries that Caleb took Tess, but Ian informs him that Tess obviously brought him back to life and is now with him willingly. In serious denial, Jack is ready to deck Ian, and Rafe has to intervene. After sending Jack home to wait for Tess, Rafe bawls Ian out for getting into it with Jack, who clearly isn't ready to face the truth about his wife. Ian believes that they all have to face the fact that they will never beat Caleb. Thinking his friend needs a wake-up call, Rafe says that when Ian is ready to give up, he'll put him out of his misery--after giving him a minute to say goodbye to his loved ones. Ian admits that he's not ready for that. He goes back to the loft. Lucy apologizes for failing him, but he doesn't blame her. He turns down her offer to make love as a way to make him feel better. When Rafe fills Alison in on what happened, she worries about how Jack is taking this. She begins to wonder whether they were too worried about using Tess to realize that they were the ones being made fools of. Jack realizes that Tess isn't coming back to him.",
        "Tess takes Caleb to a secret place that Jack doesn't know about. She calls him \"Caleb\" now because that's who he is, just as she is Tess. Caleb doesn't understand why she brought him back to life, but Tess explains that it was the right thing to do. She is angry with Jack and the others for using her. Incredulous, Caleb asks whether she really does love him after all, and Tess says that she couldn't have healed him otherwise. This is Caleb's first experience with unconditional love. He realizes that Tess had to make a lot of sacrifices. He points out that Jack will be angry with her. Tess doesn't want to talk about Jack or anything else. She's tired of being pulled between Caleb and her husband. She's made a decision to let Livvie come out so that she and Caleb can be together. Taking her hand, Caleb admits that he doesn't want Livvie. He wants Tess."

        "Lucy: Well, we were trying to absorb, you now, everything that happened tonight, and he got this really weird look on his face, and he just took off.",
        "Alison: He did? That's funny because Rafe had to go run some mysterious errand, too. Look.",

        "Elizabeth: It was gone. Everything was gone. It was just like before -- before Stephen. All the symptoms -- I mean, how could Rafe let this happen? Even you said that he was going to be able to fix it, but obviously he didn't because it's back!",
        "Alison: Slow down. What are you talking about?",

        "Caleb: Why -- after all the things that I've done, why would you bring me back?",
        "Tess: Because it was the right thing to do. Your life is just as precious as anyone else's.",
        "Caleb: There must have been more to it than that.",
        "Tess: I was really upset by what Jack had done -- what they all had done. And when I saw you lying there, I knew -- I knew I had to bring you back.",
        "Caleb: Is it possible that you really do love me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: That's what I was feeling. Caleb is alive? That's what I was so afraid of -- he's alive.",
        "Alison: That must be where Rafe rushed off to, and Ian, too. How can this be happening? This was supposed to be over, and we were finally going to be able to be safe again.",
        "Lucy: I know I killed him. I killed him! I don't understand what went wrong!",
        "Elizabeth: You killed him? You killed him? What kind of slayer did you turn out to be? You can't even tell if a vampire is dead or alive?",

        "Lucy: Shut up, Elizabeth. Just shut up. This isn't just about you, you know. This affects everybody. Everybody's in danger now. There's a million things I have to do and think about. I have to think about this.",
        "Elizabeth: Listen, Lucy, you don't have to live like this. I do! Please, you have got to help me. Anything that you can do to end his life -- please, please, just make him disappear. Help me.",

        "Alison: Where are you going?",
        "Lucy: I am going to find Ian!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Face it, Jack. Caleb's back.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but it wasn't Tess who brought him back.",
        "Ian: Then who was it? I was a dead man once. She put her hands on me and brought me back to life. You know her powers.",
        "Jack: Look, he took Tess, and I've got to find her. She's my wife. She loves me. And if she's with Caleb, she's in danger.",
        "Ian: If she's with Caleb, she's where she wants to be!",
        "Jack: You know what? Shut up!",
        "Rafe: Stop! Just stop. This isn't doing anyone any good. All right, now, Jack, you might be right. But guess what? If Caleb has Tess, she's really smart, so she's going to find a way to reach you.",
        "Jack: All right. So maybe she went back home like she always does.",
        "Rafe: That's right, that's right. That's what you do -- you follow her past behavior.",
        "Jack: Ok, ok. Look, I'm going to go check back at home.",
        "Rafe: And we'll keep checking in, all right?",
        "Jack: And we're not finished.",
        "Rafe: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Ian: We both know what happened here.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, and so does he! He's just not ready to face it yet.",
        "Ian: What we need to face is the truth Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Really? What truth is that?",
        "Ian: We can't beat Caleb. This is his nightmare, and we're part of it.",
        "Rafe: No, I don't accept it.",
        "Ian: You don't accept it? You don't have a demon living inside you! I was a man for one minute. Now I'm back to --",
        "Rafe: I am not going to let you give up. You still have your research.",
        "Ian: What research? He's alive, and I'm walking around like a dead man!",
        "Rafe: All right, all right, fine. So, what do you want to do? Huh? You just give me the word when you want to give up. You give up Danny, you give up Lucy, all of it. You just give me the word, and I'll put you out of your misery! All right? I'll even give you a few minutes to say good-bye to everything you love and everyone who loves you.",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Rafe: All right. Now, look, you're right. I don't know what it is you're going through. I don't know what it's like to fight this demon from the inside. But I do know what it's like to lose hope.",
        "Ian: Do you?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I do. Alison and I -- we had it back for just a second, and now it's gone again. But you know what? We're going to get it back again. All of us are. Right?",
        "Ian: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Of course I love you, Caleb. Did you think I was lying when I said it before?",
        "Caleb: I guess I found it hard to believe.",
        "Tess: Well, I couldn't have saved you if I didn't.",
        "Caleb: You --you have a power beyond anything I've ever felt.",
        "Tess: What did you feel?",
        "Caleb: I took in my last breath, and I just felt this certain kind of acceptance.",
        "Tess: And you weren't afraid?",
        "Caleb: I just knew this time -- this time it was over and there was nothing to do but embrace the darkness forever.",
        "Tess: I think I felt that moment, too.",
        "Caleb: Except suddenly there was this little sliver of light, like the sun breaking through the clouds. It was you. You were calling me back. I've only heard of unconditional love before. I've never known it. Sure as hell never felt it. And I know what kind of sacrifices you had to make.",
        "Tess: I had no choice.",
        "Caleb: Jack is going to be very angry with you.",
        "Tess: I don't want to talk about Jack right now. I don't want to think about anything.",
        "Caleb: You ok?",
        "Tess: I'm tired.",
        "Caleb: You should rest. Just let go. Let me be your strength.",
        "Tess: Why are you doing this?",
        "Caleb: Because I want to.",
        "Tess: I know, and that makes me very sad.",
        "Caleb: Me being here with you?",
        "Tess: No, you using my weakness to get to Livvie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You know?",
        "Lucy: I know.",
        "Lucy: It's obscene. It's so unfair. I -- I can't think of anything -- no words --",
        "Ian: We tried.",
        "Lucy: I -- I am so sorry.",
        "Ian: Well, it's not your fault. You know, you did everything you could, so --",
        "Lucy: But I didn't save you.",
        "Ian: I love you for wanting to.",
        "Lucy: Don't give up. Come on, it's not over. We don't give up. We're going think of something. You, me, Rafe, all -- we'll think of something.",
        "Lucy: I love you.",
        "Ian: I know. That's why I still exist.",
        "Lucy: Are you ok? Can -- can I make you feel better?",
        "Ian: No. I'm not going to use you like that.",
        "Lucy: Use me? I want -- I want to be with you.",
        "Ian: We can't. Not like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You go to sleep. Shh.",
        "Alison: I was so worried about you.",
        "Rafe: So I guess you figured out about Caleb, huh?",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, I do. I don't understand, though. How did it happen?",
        "Rafe: Neither do I. The best I can figure is Tess used her healing powers on him.",
        "Alison: What? Tess?",
        "Rafe: I did everything right this time. All the slayer rituals, everything down -- I did everything.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Jack must be going out of his mind.",
        "Rafe: When he left, he was pretty much in a state of denial. You know, he didn't want to admit how much Caleb has a hold over Tess.",
        "Alison: Wait, Rafe -- do you think that this whole thing was a lie? I mean, Jack and Tess and her whole kindness thing -- do you think that we were so worried about setting her up to get Caleb -- were we actually the ones being made fools of?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're not coming back, are you, Tess? You're with him. You brought Caleb back to life, and now you're together. Guess you were always his, huh? Never really me. Maybe you were never real at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Is that what you think I'm doing? Using you to try to get to Livvie?",
        "Tess: As you always have.",
        "Caleb: I guess I deserve that.",
        "Tess: Doesn't matter anymore. I don't -- I don't want to fight about it. I'm tired of being torn between you and Jack. I don't want to try.",
        "Caleb: Just tell me -- tell me what would make you happy.",
        "Tess: To have not been used by Jack or you, to not feel hurt anymore. What would make me happy is to not have to feel that. I've made a decision. You win. Caleb, she wins. You can be with Livvie now. I don't want to fight with you anymore. You two can have each other, and I'm just going to rest.",
        "Caleb: But I don't want Livvie. I want you, Tess. I want you.",
