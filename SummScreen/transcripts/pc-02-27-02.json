        "Alison: I'm so glad that you're back, Rafe. So glad you're back. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. What about my back? ",
        "Alison: Not that back, silly. I'm talking about -- you are ticklish. I'm not \r\ntalking about that back, although I am very glad for this back, but I was \r\ntalking about your being back. That's what. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, ok. I see. ",
        "Alison: You know, Rafe, when you disappeared like that, I really didn't know \r\nwhat to think. I sort of felt like I stopped breathing. ",
        "Rafe: You know, I'm -- I'm really glad you remembered to start again. Alison, \r\nI'm sorry. You know I'd never deliberately scare you. ",
        "Alison: I know that. But you kind of are right now. I mean, is there \r\nsomething wrong? Because you've been really quiet ever since, you know, you got \r\nback. Is there something on your mind? ",
        "Rafe: Maybe. You know. Don't ask me about it, ok? ",
        "Alison: Why not? ",
        "Rafe: Because we got better things to talk about, right? ",
        "Alison: No, no, no. No, don't do this, ok? ",
        "Rafe: All right. And you're right, you're right. We just shouldn't talk at \r\nall. ",
        "Alison: No, don't, Rafe, please? Come on. I love you. And I want to know all \r\nthat there is to know. I don't care if it's bad or if it's scary, ok? But I \r\ncan't live with secrets. Just tell me what happened when you disappeared. \r\nPlease, you got to tell me. ",

        "Ricky: Zip it, Casey. ",
        "Jamal: No, no -- no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, sing it out again, nice \r\nand proud. What did you just say? ",
        "Casey: Nothing. I said nothing. ",
        "Jamal: No, you tried to cut my bike wire, trying to kill me? ",
        "Ricky: Hey, hey, back off. That's not what she meant. ",
        "Jamal: So you knew about this, too? ",
        "Ricky: No. I didn't find out until after. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, you didn't think this was something I needed to know. Is that what \r\nyou're saying, Ricky? ",
        "Ricky: What's the big deal? ",
        "Jamal: \"The big deal?\" ",
        "Ricky: You're alive, all right? She's just a kid. ",
        "Casey: Hey, I'm not a kid! ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, you could've fooled me. ",
        "Jamal: Why don't you shut up, the both of you. And you -- why don't you keep \r\nyour psycho squeeze out of my sight. ",
        "Ricky: Not my squeeze. ",
        "Jamal: Girlfriend -- call her whatever you want -- I don't care. Keep her out \r\nof my way. ",
        "Ricky: Why don't you tell her? Girlfriend in her dreams. ",
        "Casey: Nightmares, you mean. Look, you couldn't get me to sleep with you. Not \r\nthat he didn't try, but there's no way I would've given it up to a lousy ex-con \r\nwho's going to end up in jail anyway. I'm too good for that. ",
        "Jamal: Why don't you try good for nothing. ",
        "Casey: Oh, hey, hey, look who's talking. That's what your blonde bimbo said \r\nabout you right before she kicked you to the curb for Rafe. Yeah, talk about a \r\nno-brainer. ",
        "Jamal: You know what, Casey? ",
        "Casey: Yeah, what? What, you going to teach me? ",
        "Jamal: I'm too sick of looking at you to keep wasting my time. ",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, like you're easy-looking with that five-cent haircut! ",
        "Ricky: You know, you're lucky he didn't do more than get pissed. ",
        "Casey: Like you care, right? ",
        "Ricky: You're right, Casey. I don't. ",
        "Casey: Wait -- where you going, huh? Yeah, go on, run away, Ricky! Go ahead! \r\nWho needs you? Run away. ",

        "Eve: I am so glad to see you -- both of you. ",
        "Ian: Eve? ",
        "Eve: I have been looking for you everywhere, and I've been waiting and \r\nwaiting -- ",
        "Ian: Waiting? Waiting for what? ",
        "Eve: And waiting for you. I've been going out of my mind with worry, but, \r\nthen, it seems that's all I do nowadays is just worry and worry and worry and \r\nworry. ",
        "Amy: I -- I should go. ",
        "Eve: No. This is important. We need to talk. You see, I need to plan out the \r\nrest of my life. So if you wouldn't mind letting me know when you two plan on \r\nrunning off again together, I sure would appreciate it. ",
        "Ian: Hold on a second -- ",
        "Eve: It's not that easy getting a sitter for Danny at the last minute. No \r\nguilt intended -- I hate to rain on your extracurricular fun -- but we need to \r\ncoordinate schedules here. ",
        "Amy: Eve, listen -- ",
        "Eve: Sorry. I know that spontaneity's half the thrill, but with a job, a \r\nmarriage, and an infant son, someone has to make sacrifices. So humor me, would \r\nyou, Ian? And by the way, just how long have you been sleeping with this bitch?\r\n",

        "Rafe: You know there are some things that I can't tell you, and you have to \r\naccept that. ",
        "Alison: The only way that I can accept what we have is just to live day by \r\nday and talk myself into believing that the only thing that really matters is \r\nhaving you here with me right now, right here, today, and really focus on that.\r\n",
        "Rafe: And that's good. That's what we should both be doing, then. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. But when you left -- I mean, when you -- when you disappeared, \r\nI mean, it sort of just hit me in the face, you know? It really forced me to \r\nthink about what it was going to be like for you to be gone forever, and I -- I \r\ndon't really think that I can handle it. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what? Maybe we should talk about what it's going to be \r\nlike after I'm gone. ",
        "Alison: No. You know what? I really don't want to. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah, come on. ",
        "Alison: No, I don't think it's a good idea. ",
        "Rafe: Come here. No, yeah, it is. Come here. All right. Now -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: One day, you're going to be having dinner with Jack and Livvie, just \r\nhaving the best time in the world, and you guys will be talking about this -- \r\nthis recipe book that you'll be writing. ",
        "Alison: Oh, I don't think so. ",
        "Rafe: Shh -- yeah, yeah. And you guys are going to be so excited about it \r\nthat you're going to stay up all hours of the night talking. And then, by the \r\ntime you get home, you'll be so tired that you'll fall fast asleep, and you'll \r\ndream. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'll dream about you. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, about us and what it's like right now, tonight, with my arms \r\nwrapped around you. And I'll whisper in your ear, \"Alison, I love you. I always \r\nwill.\" And then I'll be kissing your neck. And I'll be kissing your neck. ",
        "Alison: And you'll be kissing my lips. ",
        "Rafe: You know I have to leave you. But what we have, what we've been lucky \r\nenough to find -- it's a love that never dies. ",

        "Ian: You got it wrong, Eve. ",
        "Eve: I don't think so. ",
        "Ian: Well, then, think again. ",
        "Eve: Oh, I will, Ian. I really will -- right after you tell me how long \r\nyou've had her on her back behind mine. ",
        "Ian: There's a reason for this. It's not what it looks -- ",
        "Eve: What it looks like? Right. Because it never really is -- not with you, \r\nright? But it does have something to do with a woman always. There was Lucy or \r\nArianna or -- ",
        "Amy: Excuse me, Eve -- ",
        "Eve: No, I've been excusing you ever since you came to town. ",
        "Ian: That's enough, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Uh-uh. No, I'm sorry to blind-side you, Amy. I really am. I know he made \r\nyou feel special. But you're not the first. ",
        "Amy: Please, Eve -- ",
        "Eve: No, and just out of perverse curiosity, did this start when you moved in \r\nwith us? ",
        "Amy: I know how upset you are -- ",
        "Eve: Really? And you can tell that just by the sound of my voice? ",
        "Ian: Eve -- ",
        "Eve: You are amazing. Shut up! ",
        "Amy: I know why you think what you think, Eve, but -- ",
        "Eve: Really? You do? Well, gee, it makes me feel so much better to know that \r\nyou feel my pain because pretty soon I'm going to be feeling yours. ",
        "Amy: What? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Ramsey seems to think that you're hiding a little secret, and I'm \r\nstarting to agree with him. ",
        "Ian: Ramsey? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Amy: He doesn't know what he's talking about. ",
        "Eve: Oh, but he's going to find out, and I'm going to help him find out what \r\nyour little secret is. And when I do, I'm going to shout it from the top of the \r\nrooftops. ",
        "Ian: The hell you will, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Watch me. ",
        "Ian: No, you watch me. Leave her alone. Is that clear? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: What? You looking to finish the job your girl loused up? ",
        "Ricky: No. That's her project. Besides, if I wanted to clip you, we wouldn't \r\nbe sitting here talking right now. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, Ricky, you scare me. ",
        "Ricky: I tell you what -- I got a plan, huh? Why don't we both just stay out \r\nof each other's ways, huh? ",
        "Jamal: We told Gabby we'd look out for each other, though. ",
        "Ricky: So? You didn't mean it, and neither did I. ",
        "Jamal: We finally agree on something. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, hey, hey -- no payback on Casey, all right? She's just a kid. ",
        "Jamal: A dangerous kid. ",
        "Ricky: She didn't know what she was doing. She cut the speedometer cable, \r\nman. ",
        "Jamal: You really are dumber than you look, aren't you? You got a thing for \r\nher? ",

        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah. ",
        "Alison: But how about you tell me another story? ",
        "Rafe: You got it. Anything. ",
        "Alison: How about you tell me what happened when you disappeared and you got \r\ncalled back to heaven. ",
        "Rafe: Nice try. ",
        "Alison: Come on, Rafe. Seriously. I need to know. Ok, I need to know. Why do \r\nangels get called back? ",
        "Rafe: I can't talk about other angels or why they get called back, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok, I know. I understood it then, and I accepted it then, but when \r\nyou disappeared on me, like, I felt like it was all my fault because I started \r\ntalking to you about having a baby and I thought maybe -- ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, no. It wouldn't, no. That's not why they called me back.\r\n",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: But I can tell you something about that. Having a baby -- it's not \r\ngoing to be in the cards for us. ",
        "Alison: How do you know? ",
        "Rafe: Heard from a much higher authority. ",
        "Alison: Oh. You mean, like, God? ",
        "Rafe: Someone like that. ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Rafe: I'm really sorry. ",
        "Alison: Well, just promise me something, ok? ",
        "Rafe: If I can. ",
        "Alison: Just promise me that when you do leave for good that I won't be \r\nholding you one minute and then have you just disappear on me the next, ok? I \r\nwould really like a proper goodbye. So if you could just promise me that. ",
        "Rafe: I promise. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: Yes. ",

        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Rafe: What's that? ",
        "Alison: Oh! That's my muffins. I put them in right before I laid you out on \r\nthe carpet. I'll be right back. Let me just go get them. ",
        "Rafe: Muffins. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's sort of an old habit -- baking fool. ",

        "Casey: Look, you got to help me, all right? So far this life has been even \r\nworse than the last one. All right, Ricky thinks that I'm this big tease because \r\n-- because what? I disappeared right before we were about to go and have -- you \r\nknow. But then -- then he goes off on me, right? So what do I do? What do I do? \r\nI run my mouth off on him. But then the truth is, Rafe -- the truth is that I \r\nwant to be with him. But then I remember, I remember, so I push him away because \r\nI don't want him to get too close because then he might end up in the fifth \r\nchair -- ",
        "Rafe: Don't -- ",
        "Casey: And then I know what Ed said, Rafe. I know what Ed said. So I don't \r\nwant him to have this death sentence because, you know, we sleep together. ",

        "Eve: It's bad enough you have an affair with her, you're cheating, but now \r\nyou're taking her side? ",

        "Amy: Eve, you don't understand what's going -- ",
        "Eve: Oh, no, I understand. I do understand. But you know what? You don't know \r\nIan. The only reason he even looked at you twice is because you're so damn \r\nneedy. The more desperate you are, the more it gives him a chance to act like a \r\nhero. ",
        "Amy: Well, if you think that I'd use my blindness as a way to manipulate --\r\n",
        "Eve: I know -- what I think is that if right now you don't leave me and my \r\nhusband alone, I will blow you out of the water and watch the little pieces sink \r\none by one. Have a nice life. ",
