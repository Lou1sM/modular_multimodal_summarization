        "Alison: So, Jack, you hungry, or what? ",
        "Jamal: Are you kidding? After saving the bike shop from being trashed by \r\nthose lowlifes, my man is starving. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey. I just ran off a couple of slime balls. No big deal. ",
        "Jamal: No, sorry, man. We owe you. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. See, that's what happens, Jack. When you do a good deed, people \r\nare very grateful. ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: And believe me, after hearing about the way you treated Livvie, I \r\nknew it was going to take quite a bit to be joining your fan club. ",
        "Jack: You know what, Alison? Thanks for reminding me. I really appreciate \r\nthat. ",
        "Alison: You're welcome. I know. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, don't let it get to you, man. I mean, things might work out for \r\nyou guys, you know. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, but I think right now, the best thing for me is to just \r\nkind of lay low, stay as far away from Livvie as I can manage. And that way, I \r\nwon't have to get into any trouble with her. ",
        "Livvie: Hi, Alison. ",
        "Alison: Well, Livvie, speak of the devil. ",

        "Chris: Kim, come in. So, what's been going on? ",
        "Kim: Well, there's not much to tell yet. I've only been on the job a few \r\ndays, and Estelle keeps me pretty busy. ",
        "Chris: Ok, ok. Well, you know where Livvie is now? I mean, you know that \r\nmuch. ",
        "Kim: She got all dressed up, very nice, very conservative. ",
        "Chris: And then? ",
        "Kim: She left to see a friend. ",
        "Chris: She did? ",
        "Kim: Is this the kind of information you're looking for? Dr. Ramsey? ",
        "Chris: Yeah -- yes, yes. It's just I want you to scrape together anything you \r\ncan, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you. I need to know Livvie \r\nbetter than she knows herself. Before long, it'll be like I'm reading her mind.\r\n",

        "Mac: Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: Keep it down. ",
        "Mac: What are you doing here? ",
        "Kevin: I got called to try and talk the jumper in, but it's not just any \r\njumper. It's Lucy. ",
        "Mac: Lucy? Well, what are we doing -- ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let me. ",
        "Mac: Kevin, after everything the two of you have been through lately, just \r\nseeing you might send her over. ",
        "Kevin: I know. I thought about that. That's why I held back, but I know her. \r\nJust give me a chance. ",
        "Mac: All right, you got it, but if you need me, I'm right here. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy? ",

        "Livvie: Can I come in? ",
        "Alison: Only if you really want to. ",
        "Livvie: What do you mean if I want to? It's freezing. Oh. ",
        "Alison: So, Livvie, what's up with the outfit? You kind of look like you're \r\ngoing to one of my nana's, like, Fundraiser for Fossils parties or something.\r\n",
        "Livvie: You mean sophisticated. ",
        "Jamal: She means old. ",
        "Livvie: Oh -- actually, I'm going to the opera with Chris. ",
        "Jamal: What, you're meeting him here? ",
        "Livvie: No. Um -- I came by to -- to borrow something from Alison. Remember? \r\nThose earrings that I really like, the ones I always wear.",
        "Alison: Oh -- yes. Those ones, yeah. I'm sure they're around here somewhere. \r\nWell, why don't we go find those? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Here's your chance, man -- kiss and make up on a platter, dude. Come \r\non. She walked right in. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I saw her face when she did. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you're wrong, man. Take a chance, man. Just give it a shot, \r\ndude. ",
        "Alison: Oh, I know where they are. They're underneath the bed. ",
        "Livvie: What? Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Livvie, you have never borrowed earrings from me, ever. Now, would \r\nyou mind telling me what's going on, and the real story, please? What are you \r\ndoing here? ",
        "",
        "Chris: You have any idea who this person was Livvie went to see? ",
        "Kim: I think her name was Alison. ",
        "Chris: Uh-huh. Ok, and she just left? She didn't mention our date? ",
        "Kim: She started to get dressed for it earlier, so at first, I thought she \r\nwas excited. ",
        "Chris: Wait, wait -- at first? ",
        "Kim: Well, after a while, she got quiet, like something was on her mind. Then \r\nsuddenly, she was out the door. ",
        "Chris: You have any idea what was bothering her? ",
        "Kim: Like what? ",
        "Chris: I need something -- something that I -- some way I can get her to look \r\nat me the way she was looking at me yesterday when I took care of Jack. Look, I need \r\nto get her to trust me to do anything I tell her to do. ",
        "Kim: Well, I don't know if this will make any difference. ",
        "Chris: What is it? ",
        "Kim: It's an ad for a band she really likes. They're playing at Jake's \r\ntonight. So she cut it out of the paper, only -- ",
        "Chris: Only she remembered that she had tickets to go to the opera with me.\r\n",
        "Kim: She threw it away. I dug it out, in case you wanted to buy her their CD.\r\n",
        "Chris: Great. Good work. Keep at it. ",
        "Kim: Well, I better be getting back to Estelle before she wakes up. Ok? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, go ahead. Do that. \"Brad Masters and the Troublemakers.\" I have \r\ntickets to \"Tosca\" and she'd rather listen to this garbage. Ramsey, you're a \r\ngenius. ",
        "Chris: Ramsey, you're a genius. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, don't say anything. Just for a second, listen to me. I know \r\nyou're upset about a lot of things. But we can talk to each other, can't we? ",
        "Lucy: You want to talk to me? ",
        "Kevin: Of course. I'd never turn my back on you. And we'll get through this.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Doc, Sarah -- it's Sarah who needs your help. ",
        "Kevin: Sarah? ",
        "Lucy: Yes -- the woman on the ledge. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: I've been trying to talk to her and help her. ",
        "Kevin: Sarah? ",
        "Sarah: What? Who are you? ",
        "Lucy: Sarah, listen, this is Kevin. He's a very, very good friend of mine, \r\nand -- and he really wants to help you. Sarah's husband Paul just died. ",
        "Sarah: I just want to be with him wherever he is. I don't want to be alone.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Boy, do I know that feeling. That's the one that grows inside you \r\nuntil it threatens to smother you and put you out of your misery, right? ",
        "Sarah: But it never does. ",
        "Kevin: No. It never does. It just takes you to the edge, gasping for air with \r\nyour life flashing in front of you. ",
        "Sarah: Well, it'll stop if I jump. ",
        "Kevin: Do you really think that's what Paul would want for you? Sarah, do you \r\nremember all the other times in your life that were dark? When you thought you'd \r\nnever laugh again? And you thought that's the way it would always be? The truth \r\nis things do change. Sooner or later, they always do. And things happen the way \r\nthey do for a reason -- to teach us something, to put us on a path that we never \r\nknew was there. ",
        "Kevin: The universe has a plan, Sarah. We may not always understand it. But \r\nwe have to trust it. ",
        "Sarah: Why? ",
        "Kevin: Because when we do, the world starts to make sense again. Let me help \r\nyou, Sarah. Give me your hand, and I promise you, you won't be alone. Give me \r\nyour hand. That's it. That a girl. I -- I got you. I got you. Oh. Ok, ok. Ok. \r\nYou're going to be all right. You're going to be ok. ",
        "Colleen: Dr. Collins? ",
        "Kevin: Sarah, these are two very good friends of mine. This is Colleen, and \r\nmy best friend, Mac. ",
        "Colleen: Are you cold, Sarah? Come here, come here. ",
        "Kevin: Five milligrams diazepam Q.I.D. ",
        "Colleen: Sure. ",
        "Kevin: You wouldn't mind taking Sarah down to the ER just for clearance, \r\nwould you? ",
        "Colleen: No. ",
        "Kevin: I'll catch up to you in a little while, ok? ",
        "Sarah: Thank you. ",
        "Mac: Great job as always, man. Great job. I'll catch up with you later. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Whew. ",
        "Lucy: Doc? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, let's hear it. Did you honestly think I would commit suicide \r\nbecause I wasn't pregnant with your baby? ",
        "",
        "Brad: Sorry, man, but I'm going to pass. I know you got some real pull in \r\nthis town, but -- ",
        "Chris: You know, Brad, I got a thousand bucks here that says you'll \r\nreconsider. Get 500 up front, 500 when the favor's done. What do you say now?\r\n",
        "Brad: I say you're on. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Just admit it. You stopped by to see how you know who is after he was \r\njumped yesterday. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Ok, I was just -- I was a little concerned. ",
        "Alison: \"A little concerned?\" Please, you are so sprung. ",
        "Jamal: Yo, Ali? Hey, come here for a second, would you? I just got this great \r\nidea. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Uh -- here's your earrings, Livvie, although, I still think they \r\nare way too cool for the opera. Ok. So, what'd you come up with without me? ",
        "Jamal: So what do you think about bringing in Jack with us? ",
        "Alison: To live? ",
        "Jamal: No, no, no -- as a partner. ",
        "Jack: Yo, you mean the shop? Are you serious? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, why not, man? We need good workers who put in the time for low \r\nmoney at first. And then, we can give him a cut of the profits. ",
        "Alison: Well, yeah -- ",
        "Jamal: You know? ",
        "Alison: Because we do have that room in the back you could use as your place.\r\n",
        "Jamal: There you go. ",
        "Jack: I -- I don't know what to say. ",
        "Jamal: Ah! Welcome to the family, boy. ",
        "Jack: Oh, come here. I might as well give you -- ",
        "Alison: Ah! ",
        "Jack: Oh. ",
        "Alison: God. ",
        "Livvie: Hey. Congratulations, Jack, on your new plans. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, just wait until the place really gets open because we're \r\ngoing to be raking in the money. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, it's just a garage. That's it, you know.\r\n",
        "Alison: Well, it might be just a garage now, Jamal, but I happen to have a \r\nfew ideas of my own. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, boy. ",
        "Alison: This is going to be the coolest spot in the town. You know, people \r\ncan, like, hang out there. Maybe we could get an espresso machine. ",
        "Livvie: And a jukebox would be a really good idea. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, music, we need music. Maybe some live music. Jamal, you know \r\nthat guy who sells all the electronic stuff for real cheap. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but -- ",
        "Jack: And why don't we put a photo booth in the corner? ",
        "Livvie: Now, that is a great idea. ",
        "Jack: You -- you think? ",
        "Livvie: Well, why not? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, why not? ",
        "Alison: Ahem -- ok. I'm sorry to interrupt this idea session here, but, \r\nLivvie, don't you have to go somewhere? Aren't you going to be late for that fat \r\nlady with the horns? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. We wouldn't want to miss that, would we? ",
        "Livvie: I'm sure Chris is wondering where I am. I'm already late. So -- ",
        "Jack: Are -- are you sure that you have to go? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'm sure. Um -- yeah. I got to run. But congratulations on the \r\nnew plans, everybody, and thanks for the earrings. ",
        "Jamal: All right, thanks. ",
        "Jack: Livvie? Wait. Whew -- ooh. Don't go. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Did you really think I would commit suicide over you? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I got a call that there was a jumper on the roof. I came out \r\nhere and I saw you. I know how you've been feeling. It's really not that much of \r\na reach. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, you're right. Lucy's so fragile these days and Lucy always \r\njumps to conclusions, so why not figure, yep, Lucy might just jump off a roof?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Ok, fine. I jump to conclusions myself sometimes. ",
        "Lucy: Sometimes? ",
        "Kevin: Wouldn't you rather go inside and talk about this? I mean, you must be \r\na little shaken up. ",
        "Lucy: Who says I'm shaken up? ",
        "Kevin: All right, fine. I'm shaken up and I'm cold. ",
        "Lucy: Well, thanks for sharing your feelings, but I don't need you to tell me \r\nwhat I'm feeling. You don't even know a tenth of what I'm feeling. ",
        "Kevin: Then teach me! Lucy, tell me what's going on in your mind -- starting \r\nwith why you're raking me over because I walked through the door and made an \r\nhonest mistake. Because? ",
        "Lucy: Because -- because -- I -- I can't have a baby, ever. ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? ",
        "Lucy: I cannot ever have children. It's impossible. Are you satisfied? ",
        "Kevin: Since when? ",
        "Lucy: Since I went to see Dr. Neumann. ",
        "Kevin: Is she sure? ",
        "Lucy: That the disease Rachel gave me did the trick? Yeah. She's sure, and \r\nit's over. It's impossible. That's what she said. I can never, ever have \r\nchildren. It is impossible. ",
        "Kevin: And that's the word she used? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know what words -- I don't remember exactly what words she \r\nused. I don't know! But I got the message loud and clear. I can't have them, \r\never. The odds were against me from the beginning, but now I have -- I have no \r\nodds. It's over, so all this dreaming and hoping and planning and wishing -- it \r\nwas just all a -- a waste, a waste. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, Lucy, I'm so sorry. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's ok. It's -- you know what? I don't want that. I don't want \r\nthat look on your face. I don't want the pity from you. I don't want anything \r\nfrom you. I just want to tell you that you're not always right. You cannot \r\nalways help everyone and you can't always fix everything. Ok? ",
        "",
        "Mac: Hey. Kevin, great job today. Impressive as hell. ",
        "Kevin: Thanks. ",
        "Mac: In fact, you know what? You got me thinking about starting something new \r\nat the department -- kind of a psychiatric swat team. ",
        "Kevin: Friend of mine in Denver set up something like that. ",
        "Mac: Really? Think about it, you know. A group of psychiatric specialists on \r\ncall, ready to go? I mean, it might make a difference next time we face an \r\nemergency like this. ",
        "Kevin: It's a good thought. ",
        "Mac: But you were thinking about something else, weren't you? ",
        "Kevin: No. No. No, it's just -- ",
        "Mac: It's just -- it's just what, Kevin? Come on, are you going to tell me or \r\ndo I have to drag it out of you? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy just told me that she can't have children. Ever. ",
        "Mac: Are you sure? ",
        "Kevin: A baby of her own is the one thing she's wanted more than anything in \r\nthe world. You should've seen the look in her eyes when she told me. Watching a \r\ndream like that die off forever. ",
        "Mac: You know what, Kevin? I -- I get the feeling that Lucy might not be the \r\nonly one who had a dream die on her tonight. ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? ",
        "Mac: Come on, mate. Bottom of your heart -- I mean, weren't you always kind \r\nof hoping that you and Lucy might start a family one day? ",

        "Jack: Livvie, don't go. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I have to. I made plans. ",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. You don't even like the opera. I mean, look at you all \r\nstarched up like some middle-aged doctor's wife. That's not you. You're 10 times \r\nmore beautiful when you're just in jeans and a t-shirt. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I like the way I look. ",
        "Jack: Or maybe it's just that Chris likes the way you look. ",
        "Livvie: And so what if he does? Chris has really great taste. ",
        "Jack: But it's not you. Livvie, Chris wants a trophy. He doesn't give a damn \r\nabout you. ",

        "Jack: Oh. ",
        "Brad: So, can you help me out here, Livvie? I mean, we don't want to play \r\nwithout him out front. You guys can bag the Puccini, can't you? ",
        "Chris: Your call. ",
        "Brad: You want me to beg? ",
        "Livvie: No. No, no, no. You don't have to. I've been dying to see one of your \r\nconcerts. It's just I -- oh -- I don't want to disappoint Chris. ",
        "Chris: Oh, no, no. I mean, we can listen to the swooping sopranos anytime. \r\nCome on, I'll run you home. You can change. ",
        "Brad: Great. So tickets will be at the door, and don't worry -- we won't play \r\na note till you get there. ",
