        "Ian: Don't move a muscle. ",
        "Eve: Hi. ",
        "Ian: Hey. All right, sit up and eat. I don't care if you're hungry or not.\r\n",
        "Eve: Oh, I am so hungry. ",
        "Ian: Ok, good. That means you're feeling better. ",
        "Eve: Wow. Where did you get all this? ",
        "Ian: I was out there performing manly duties. ",
        "Eve: Performing your manly duties? What would those be? ",
        "Ian: Hunting. ",
        "Eve: Oh. And how many mangoes did you have to kill to get all this? ",
        "Ian: Uh -- ",
        "Eve: Hmm? ",
        "Ian: Maya put this tray together for you. ",
        "Eve: Well, I can think of some other manly duties that you can perform for \r\nme. ",
        "Ian: Is that right? I guess you're feeling better. ",
        "Eve: Because of you. ",
        "Ian: I love you. What is it? Eve, what? What just came into your head? ",
        "Eve: Your wife. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Hey. ",
        "Arianna: Hey. ",
        "Gabriela: Joe gave me this on the way in. Telegram for you. ",
        "Arianna: Maybe it's from Ian. ",
        "Gabriela: What's wrong? ",
        "Arianna: No -- he's just going to be longer than expected, that's all. ",
        "Gabriela: You're disappointed. ",
        "Arianna: He's a doctor. He has a commitment to help others. I understand \r\nthat. So, where's Joe? ",
        "Gabriela: He's on his way back to the hospital. Major MVA came in. ",
        "Arianna: MVA? ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, a multi-vehicle accident. I told him I would wait up for him, \r\nbut when he gets home, he's going to be so fried, he'll just want to crash. I'm \r\nsorry, I'll remember to provide subtitles next time. ",
        "Arianna: No! No, no, no, no. You know, I want to learn more American slang. Teach \r\nme, will you? Teach me how to be more like an American woman.",

        "Dr. Neumann's Voice: You will never be able to conceive. The test confirmed \r\nit. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I've been watching that little boy right there -- the one on the end, \r\nright on the left. He keeps opening up one eye, you know, looking around, and he \r\nfalls right back to sleep. ",
        "Kevin: He's trying to get the lay of the land. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I think so. You know, they do that. Serena used to do that. When \r\nshe was born, she would have those big eyes -- what are you doing here? ",
        "Kevin: I was on my way to see Alan. ",
        "Lucy: Alan's office isn't on this floor. ",
        "Kevin: I got sidetracked. ",
        "Lucy: They're beautiful, aren't they? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, they are. I didn't know you'd be here. ",
        "Lucy: Well, how could you? It's the last place I should be, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Are you all right, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: I told you, I'm fine. In fact, I guess I'm sort of relieved. ",
        "Kevin: Relieved? ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, all my life all I've ever wanted was to have a baby of \r\nmy own. In fact, I've been sort of consumed by it. Even when I was working on \r\nanything else, doing anything else, it was always there in the back of my head \r\n-- having that baby. And now that it's never going to happen, that it's \r\nimpossible, it won't ever, ever happen, then I can stop worrying about it. I can \r\njust put it out of my mind. ",
        "Kevin: Can you? ",
        "Lucy: I don't have any choice, do I? But it's good, you know. It's ok because \r\nnow I know I can move forward. I can go on with my life, you know, do other things. ",
        "Kevin: By coming to the nursery and looking at babies? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, please, Doc, do not try to analyze me. ",
        "Kevin: I'm not doing that. ",
        "Lucy: Then what are you doing? What are you doing? I thought I told you to \r\nplease leave me alone. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know, but -- ",
        "Lucy: But what? But what? Why are you doing this? What do you want from me?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I want to help you deal with the news you got today. ",
        "Lucy: I am -- I'm dealing with it. ",
        "Kevin: I don't think you are. ",
        "Lucy: What do you want me to do? Do you want me to fall apart right in front of \r\nyour eyes? Do you want me to crumble up on the floor? Do you wish it was me \r\njumping off that roof today? ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Lucy: Then what? What does one do? How does one deal with news like this when \r\nthey get it? You tell me. ",
        "Kevin: I see patients every day, Lucy, day in and day out. I can be objective \r\nabout their problems, and somehow I know just how to help them. But with you, I \r\ncan't do that, as much as I want to. I want to be able to take you in my arms \r\nand hold you and make everything ok. ",
        "Lucy: But you can't. You can't. Nobody can. You know, I -- I look at them, \r\nand all I see is the baby that I wanted. And I wanted that baby to be ours. You \r\nand me. But it's not going to happen -- not now, not ever. Not ever. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Being American is a lot of different things. I mean, people here \r\nare from everywhere and they speak all different kinds of languages and -- ",
        "Arianna: Ok, it's not the same, like in my country. See, women here say \r\nwhatever they want, they dress how they want, they do what they want. ",
        "Gabriela: And what do you want? ",
        "Arianna: To change. ",
        "Gabriela: But how, exactly? ",
        "Arianna: Well, my look, how I act, the way I say things. ",
        "Gabriela: But that's not really changing you, though. ",
        "Arianna: Well, I also thought of taking some university classes, you know, \r\nmaybe even get a career. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah? Like what kind of career? ",
        "Arianna: I always enjoyed science. ",
        "Gabriela: Like medicine? ",
        "Arianna: That could be interesting. ",
        "Gabriela: Are you trying to make yourself into an American woman or into the \r\nkind of woman you think Ian wants? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Can I peel this for you? ",
        "Eve: I want you to answer a question for me. ",
        "Ian: About Arianna? ",
        "Eve: Your wife. ",
        "Ian: In name only. ",
        "Eve: I know. I know, you married her to protect her from her brother. But if \r\nyou did that, then why are you here with me and not there with her? ",
        "Ian: Ben's gone. ",
        "Eve: What? What happened? ",
        "Ian: He thinks he killed Joe. ",
        "Eve: Joe's dead? ",
        "Ian: No, Joe isn't dead. The Scanlon boys and I -- we came up with a plan and \r\nmade it look like he was dead. And that sent Ben back to his own country. ",
        "Eve: That's great. That means you're free. That means we can finally be \r\ntogether, right? ",
        "Ian: No, not yet. ",
        "Eve: Why not? ",
        "Ian: If Immigration finds out that this marriage isn't real, they're going to \r\ndeport Arianna back to her own country, where her brother is waiting. ",
        "Eve: So you have to stay married. For how long? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. ",
        "Eve: Well, don't you have a plan or anything? ",
        "Ian: I did what I did to make sure that Arianna was safe. I didn't really -- \r\nI didn't really think past that. I didn't think we'd have a future together. ",
        "Eve: I know. I just wish things were different. ",
        "Ian: So do I. ",
        "Eve: I wish we could stay on this island forever and live together. ",
        "Ian: Our hearts will always be here. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, that sounds really romantic. But you know, I would just settle for \r\ngetting on a plane, flying back to Port Charles, and acting like any other \r\ncouple in love -- making out and holding hands all the time. ",
        "Ian: Well, I want that, too, but I -- ",
        "Eve: Not now. Yeah. ",
        "Ian: You said you understood. ",
        "Eve: I do understand. But, Ian, we're so close to being together, and every \r\ntime we get so close, something happens that rips us apart. How long is it going \r\nto be like that? ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I feel like such a burden to him. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, he's not complaining. ",
        "Arianna: Maybe not, but when it's time for me to make a life for myself here, \r\nI'd like to know that I can. ",
        "Gabriela: I think you're underestimating yourself. ",
        "Arianna: You don't understand what I come from. Women are not allowed to even \r\nthink about having a life of their own. Not like women here. I need to learn \r\nwhat that feels like, and I need someone to teach me. Will you? ",
        "Gabriela: We sure can have fun trying. Let's see what else you got. ",
        "",
        "Ian: We will be together, believe me. ",
        "Eve: When? ",
        "Ian: Do you know -- do you know how much I wish it were right now? ",
        "Eve: Probably as much as I do. I feel so stupid. ",
        "Ian: Why? ",
        "Eve: I know why you married Arianna, but when I saw you guys kissing in the \r\nRecovery Room -- ",
        "Ian: Oh, come on. That was for show, for the INS. ",
        "Eve: I know, I know. But she's so cute and perky. ",
        "Ian: Hey, I'm in love with you. ",
        "Eve: See, I told you it was stupid. ",
        "Ian: It was. It was stupid. ",
        "Eve: Hey, do you have to agree with me so quickly? ",
        "Ian: Who was it said, \"For someone so smart, you can be incredibly stupid?\"\r\n",
        "Eve: That's because you just drank poison. ",
        "Ian: And I'd do it again. ",
        "Eve: Don't. ",
        "Ian: I'd do anything for you, Lambert. And I will -- as soon as I get back.\r\n",
        "Eve: What's your plan, Thornhart? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to try and find my way out of this \r\nArianna mess. ",
        "Eve: How? ",
        "Ian: Leave it to me. ",
        "Eve: Last time I left it to you, you got yourself into trouble. ",
        "Ian: I'm not dragging you into this. ",
        "Eve: I'm already in it. ",
        "Ian: I'll figure it out. Don't worry about it. We're going to be together. \r\nStarting right now. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I am very sorry. I -- I promised that I wouldn't do this. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, it's all right. You have every right to. ",
        "Lucy: I just -- I can't help thinking that this has to have happened to me \r\nfor a reason. There has to be a reason. There's a reason, right? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. We may never know. ",
        "Lucy: I just wanted that baby for as long as I can remember. ",
        "Kevin: For as long as I've known you. ",
        "Lucy: That fantasy of mine -- you know, Prince Charming marrying me and \r\nsweeping me off to a castle and having lots and lots of children -- I always \r\nwanted that big, huge family. I just -- I feel like I'm not going to be complete \r\nif I don't have a child. I've always felt that way. That's kind of ridiculous, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Kevin: No, no, not at all. A lot of people feel that way. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, they do, but they just don't quite go to the extremes that I've \r\ngone to. ",
        "Kevin: Some do. ",
        "Lucy: But I guess it's just never going to ever happen like a -- like a \r\nlittle girl, you know? I think I've been like that my whole life where I've \r\nbelieved my dreams will come true. You know how when you're little everything's \r\npossible? Your whole life could be filled with cotton candy and balloons all the \r\ntime. Filled with everything you love. But then I guess you wake up one day, or \r\n-- I guess you grow up, huh? And you realize that is not going to happen. Your \r\ndreams are not going to come true and you're not going to have everything you \r\nwant and there are some things you will just never, ever have, no matter how \r\nmuch you want them. ",
        "Kevin: You lost one dream. That doesn't mean you have to give up on them all.\r\n",
        "Lucy: No, you're right. Just the ones I know I can't have -- like a baby and \r\nyou.",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I don't think we should shut the door on anything right now. ",
        "Lucy: This is probably the most rational decision I've ever made. You know, \r\nwhen I was preg-- when I thought I was pregnant with your baby, I took it to be \r\na sign that we were meant to be together. ",
        "Kevin: Just because you're not doesn't mean it's a sign of anything, either.\r\n",
        "Lucy: That's right. Don't you see how irrational that is -- believing in \r\nsigns and destiny, the stars, the universe? ",
        "Kevin: But that's part of who you are. ",
        "Lucy: And that's the part of me that you didn't always like. You kept saying, \r\n\"Get real, Lucy.\" So I am getting very real. ",
        "Kevin: But there's still so much unfinished business between us. ",
        "Lucy: I'm finishing it. ",
        "Kevin: Just like that? After everything we've been through, the bond we have?\r\n",
        "Lucy: This -- this bond -- it is there, most definitely. But don't you feel \r\nlike sometimes it strangles you? I know for me sometimes it does feel like that.\r\n",
        "Kevin: It's hard at times. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, it's never been really easy for us. Don't you think that maybe \r\nthat is some way -- it's trying to tell us something? ",
        "Kevin: That we should let go? ",
        "Lucy: That's the kindest thing we could do for each other. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if that's the way you feel, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: It's for the best. ",
        "Kevin: You know that's all I ever wanted for you. I'll miss you. ",
        "Lucy: I'll miss you, too, Doc. Very much. Goodbye, Doc. ",

        "Arianna: I do? ",

        "Eve: You read my mind. ",
        "Ian: What, you were thinking about me? ",

        "Ian: It was good. I cleared my head. ",
        "Eve: What do you mean? ",
        "Ian: Arianna. I'm trying to find a way out of this arrangement and still keep \r\nher safe. ",
        "Eve: Do we have to talk about this tonight? ",
        "Ian: No, we don't. It's a beautiful night. We should go for a walk on the \r\nbeach. Come on. ",
        "Eve: No. Actually, I had something else in mind. ",
        "Ian: Oh, yeah, I know. You're not feeling well. You should rest. ",
        "Eve: No, that's not it, either. I've been doing some thinking. ",
        "Ian: About what? ",
        "Eve: About our first kiss. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. You mean when you ran away. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. It's because I didn't know how it was going to make me feel. I \r\nfelt that kiss all the way down to my toes. ",
        "Ian: You mean like this? ",
        "Eve: And at Harris's compound when we were locked up together, I thought about \r\nthat kiss all the time. Whenever you looked at me, whenever you touched me, I'd \r\nlay awake at night fantasizing about it. And when you finally told me that you \r\nloved me, it was everything I ever thought it would be. You said you'd do \r\nanything for me. ",
        "Ian: I meant it. ",
        "Eve: Then I'll tell you what I want. I want you to make love to me right now.\r\n\u00a0",
