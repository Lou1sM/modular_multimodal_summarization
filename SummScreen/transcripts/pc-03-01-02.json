        "Ed: My angels, you all look so innocent, so angelic. But I know one of you is \r\nneither. One of you has a plan all their own for who's to fill that fifth chair. \r\nOne of you, it pains me to realize, is a dark angel. Someone will die because of \r\nyou. And there's not a damn thing I can do about it except hope that, with this \r\nnew day, you'll see the light, take the path that was meant for you before it's \r\ntoo late. Wake now, my angels, and remember nothing of my visit. ",

        "Paige: Well, that's one goodbye I don't think I can handle. ",
        "Kevin: Sorry. I know how close you two have become. ",
        "Paige: No, I'm the one who's sorry. If I caused you and Lucy any grief at all \r\n-- ",

        "Eve: Flowers for me? Who are they from? ",
        "Colleen: Well, my guess would be your handsome husband, but there's a note.\r\n",
        "Eve: Thanks, Colleen. Could you -- could you take them to the front desk for \r\nme, please? ",
        "Colleen: Sure. I'd love to. ",
        "Eve: Thanks. ",
        "Eve: \"Meet me in the on-call room. We need to talk.\" Well, sweetheart, what's \r\ngoing on with us is going to take a lot more than flowers to fix. All right, \r\nIan, what's -- ",

        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Rafe: Wow. ",
        "Alison: That was second grade. That was my very first school bake-off. ",
        "Rafe: Second grade? ",
        "Alison: Yes, I was good even then. ",
        "Rafe: Wow. Cool. It's so cool that your parents saved all this stuff. ",
        "Alison: No, actually, they didn't. I did. ",
        "Rafe: You -- you did? ",
        "Alison: You know, they -- they were really busy with a lot of stuff, so -- I \r\ndon't know. I just sort of figured whatever. I'd just save it, maybe for my kids \r\nsomeday, you know? But I don't know. Kids these days are probably not into that.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Hey -- come here. I'm into it. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. ",
        "Rafe: In fact, let's see what else we got here. What is this ancient-looking \r\ncandle? It's actually pretty cool. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. I totally forgot about the candles. ",
        "Rafe: What is it? Is there -- is there a story behind it? ",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, there's a story. ",
        "Rafe: Why not? There always is. Come on. What is it? ",
        "Alison: The story is I have a secret. ",

        "Alison: This was made by my great, great, great grandmother, Rebecca. I loved \r\nher so much. ",
        "Rafe: Wait a minute. I don't understand. How could you have known her? ",
        "Alison: That's my secret. ",
        "Rafe: What's your secret? ",
        "Alison: When I was really little and I was really lonely, so I would go up to \r\nthe attic and I would -- I would talk to her. ",
        "Rafe: You talked to her? Your dead grandmother was in the attic? ",
        "Alison: No, my dead grandmother was not in the attic. Come on, now. ",
        "Rafe: I don't know. ",
        "Alison: My family's not that psycho. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Alison: I would talk to an oil painting. ",
        "Rafe: Right. That's not psycho at all. ",
        "Alison: Forget it. I'm not telling you. ",
        "Rafe: No, ok -- no, no, no -- ",
        "Alison: No. ",
        "Rafe: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Just please, please, please. Tell me, tell me \r\n-- tell me about the portrait. I'll be good. ",
        "Alison: Ok. So, there was this really old oil painting up there, and my \r\nparents, like, never really hung it, you know. I think it's because they thought \r\nit was really dreary or something. I don't know. But I was really fascinated by \r\nit and I was fascinated by her because there was just something in her face. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah? Like what? ",
        "Alison: There was -- there was some look. It was really warm, you know? And \r\nshe had, like, this smile to her. It was -- it didn't even, like, just stay in \r\nher lips, you know. It sort of came out through her eyes, you know? It was a \r\nvery un-Barringtonish look. She was so beautiful. ",
        "Rafe: Sounds amazing. A little like her great, great, great granddaughter.\r\n",
        "Alison: Thank you. Anyway, the only thing that I really knew about her is \r\nthat she was a candlemaker, of all things. You know, being a Barrington and all.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Right. [German accent] So, tell me, when did you two start conversing?\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Ridiculous. Ok, so I told you that I was really \r\nfascinated by the painting, right? ",
        "Rafe: [Normal voice] Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: So this one day I was upstairs in the attic, and I was staring at the \r\npainting. And I would stare at it for longer and longer. And the more that I \r\ndid, the more real that it became, you know? Until she actually came out of the \r\npainting. And she sat down right beside me right then and there, right there in \r\nthe attic. And we sat there, and we talked for hours just about random things, \r\nyou know. She was such a good friend. That's so pathetic, isn't it? ",
        "Rafe: No. No. ",
        "Alison: I was such a loser. ",
        "Rafe: No. ",
        "Alison: I had no friends, and so I had to go find one out of a painting. ",
        "Rafe: I don't think it's pathetic at all. ",
        "Alison: Right. Well, I would talk to her about anything, and she would \r\nlisten, too, you know? And sometimes she would give me advice about certain \r\nthings. But every time she did, she -- she'd genuinely listen. Do you know what \r\nI mean? I mean, she -- she really cared. Unlike the rest of my family, who \r\nbarely even knew that I existed. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know what? Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. We should get \r\nthese boxes -- ",
        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Rafe: And put them away. ",
        "Alison: No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, Rafe, no. You didn't do anything \r\nwrong. No, not at all. All you did was help me uncover something that I had \r\nburied about myself for a very long time. You just opened up another door to my \r\nheart, just like you have been doing every day since the first day I met you.\r\n",
        "Rafe: You've done the same thing for me, angel. ",
        "Alison: But the past is the past. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: And the only thing that matters is focusing on the time that we have \r\nleft together, you know? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: So all I want to do is I -- I just want to hold you and love you. \r\nBecause that's the only thing that matters right now. ",

        "Eve: We have nothing to talk about. ",
        "Amy: Eve, wait. Wait, wait! Just hear me out, all right? ",
        "Eve: What could you possibly have to say? ",
        "Amy: I never meant to come between you and Ian. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh, I see. So it just happened, right? ",
        "Amy: Nothing happened. But I won't lie to you. I am attracted to him. And if \r\nI thought I could take him from you, I would. ",
        "Eve: Is this your idea of an apology? ",
        "Amy: I'm not saying that it's right. I'm just being honest. But it doesn't \r\nmatter anyways because he's never going to return any of my affections. ",
        "Eve: Are you saying that Ian knows the way you feel? ",
        "Amy: He knows very well. ",
        "Eve: How long has he known about this? ",
        "Amy: Since the night that we got caught in the storm. ",
        "Eve: I see. ",
        "Amy: I should also tell you that he would have never been out there if I \r\nhadn't lured him. ",
        "Eve: \"Lured?\" ",
        "Amy: There was never a patient. I just wanted to be alone with him. ",
        "Eve: Ok. All right. So you just made up this whole story? ",
        "Amy: I knew I'd only be in town a short while, and I -- I had developed these \r\nfeelings for him -- feelings I never meant to have. But, nonetheless, they were \r\nthere and they were very strong. And I just thought, you know, being the stupid \r\ngirl that I am, that just maybe he -- ",
        "Eve: What? Maybe -- maybe what? That you would steal a man away from his \r\nwife? ",
        "Amy: It was horrible, I know. There's nothing that you can say that -- that \r\nwill make me feel worse than I already do. ",
        "Eve: Oh, gosh, yeah. Yeah, you know what, Amy? That's -- that's comforting.\r\n",
        "Amy: Eve, my point is I made a fool out of myself. Ian made it very clear \r\nthat he's taken. ",
        "Eve: Hmm. ",
        "Amy: And nothing will ever change that. ",
        "Eve: Oh, ok. So you think that if you give me flowers and you tell me that my \r\nhusband did not respond to your come-ons, that's, what, supposed to make me feel \r\nbetter? ",
        "Amy: I thought you might be able to see how fortunate you are. ",
        "Eve: Oh, I see. ",
        "Amy: Eve, Ian didn't cheat on you. He could have. He had the chance. He \r\neasily could have, but he still -- he wasn't tempted. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Amy: Do you know how rare a thing that is? ",
        "Eve: So I'm supposed to give my husband extra credit for not cheating on me? \r\nIs that what you're telling me? ",
        "Amy: What I am trying to tell you is that your husband loves you. God -- but \r\nyou keep pushing him away like this. ",
        "Eve: What? What, Amy? ",
        "Amy: Ian is an incredible man with probably the truest, most generous heart \r\nthat I have ever known. Now, while I have accepted that I will never have him, \r\nif you're not careful, someone else might. ",
        "Eve: I hate to shatter your illusions, Amy, but my husband is no saint. ",
        "Ian: Nice to know how my wife really feels. ",

What I need is \r\nsomeone who can help me out with that, somebody who knows about this kind of \r\nstuff, somebody who can tell me what to do, you know, how to act. Paige and Amy. \r\nHa! Right.

        "Ian: Long enough to hear a friend sing my praises and my wife set her \r\nstraight. ",
        "Eve: How am I supposed to feel, Ian? You don't know how humiliating it is to \r\nhave this woman tell you that she's done everything in her power to seduce your \r\nhusband. ",
        "Ian: The point is she didn't, Eve. ",
        "Eve: No. The point is, Ian, you knew about this. You knew the whole time how \r\nshe felt, and you didn't tell me. How could you keep something like that from \r\nme? ",
        "Ian: Honestly, I didn't think it would serve any purpose. ",

        "Ian: That's not fair. ",
        "Eve: Maybe not. And maybe Amy wasn't just apologizing for herself. ",

        "Eve: Ian, that woman looked me straight in the face and told me that she did \r\neverything in her power to have an affair with you, and you knew the whole \r\ntime. You knew about it. ",
        "Ian: Well, maybe she hit a nerve with you. ",
        "Eve: What are you talking about? ",
        "Ian: She was implying that you were pushing me away. Is she right? ",
        "Eve: I don't know what you're waiting to hear, Ian. That I was wrong? That I \r\nshouldn't have accused you and Amy of having an affair? Is that what you mean by \r\npushing you away? Because if it is, then maybe I am. But, my God, a woman just \r\nconfessed to me that she came on to you, and you knew about it the whole time.\r\n",
        "Ian: She also told you that I wasn't interested. I don't want to argue with \r\nyou, ok? But I also don't want Amy to be right about our marriage. I need your \r\nhelp here. Give me a reason to keep fighting for us. Please. ",
