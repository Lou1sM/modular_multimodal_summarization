{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["After observing \"Marissa\" and Jamal, Ricky decides to confront them about their so-called relationship. He's clearly suspicious that \"Marissa\" isn't who she claims to be. Jamal tries to cover for Casey by kissing her, but this only fuels Ricky's suspicions. Casey takes Ricky aside to tell him the truth, but before she can confess, he kisses her. The kiss confirms what he thought. He knows exactly who she is. They share a few more joyful kisses before thunder roars and she vanishes. Jamal explains that Ricky blew her cover, which can't be a good thing. Reese pouts about being blown off by Ricky, but she perks up when Jack informs her that he's tired of sweetness and ready for someone who's bad to the bone. Reese asks whether he really wants to be a vampire again, and for right now, he can't think of a reason not to. Caleb takes Tess to his place, where he assures her that she'll be safe. They talk about what happened with Jack, including his accusation that she has feelings for Caleb. He asks whether Jack could be right about that. Tess insists that she although she does love Caleb in her own way, it isn't the way he wants her to love him. Caleb admits that he had the chance to kill Lucy but instead chose to rescue Tess from Kevin. He hopes that she'll stay with him, but it's her choice. Tess chooses to go to Jack. When she gets to the house, she's stunned to see Jack allowing Reese to kiss his neck. Ian and Lucy fight about her tactics in handling Caleb. Ian admits that he's jealous. When Lucy orders him to get out of her house, she knocks over some boxes. Ian notices that a book opened when it hit the floor. He takes it as a sign from God, because it opened to a page illustrating his vision of \"The Healing Pool,\" where the dead return to life. On his guitar, Caleb plays the five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" over and over."], "Recap Author": "Beth", "Show Title": "Port Charles", "Transcript": ["Jamal: All right.", "Casey: Yeah. Thank you.", "Jamal: Marissa -- she's more of a tuna salad kind of gal. You know what she doesn't really eat burgers and fries. She has manners and she's polite.", "Casey: You're worried about mysteries? I got a headline for you. Come here. I'm already dead.", "Jamal: Yeah, I know that, he problem, ok? I mean, you being up in everybody's face, they're going to find out that you're Casey sooner or later and that's going to blow your cover.", "Casey: I know, I know. But this guardian angel stuff -- it isn't easy. I mean, especially if you're -- especially if you're in love with the guy you're supposed to be guarding.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reese: Guess who.", "Ricky: Reese?", "Reese: Haven't seen you since", "Ricky: Right.", "Reese: Hey, you could sound a bit more interested. I'm talking about me and you and where we were heading.", "Ricky: Listen, Reese, There's something that I have to do. You mind if I call you later?", "Reese: Like I don't know when I'm being dissed.", "Ricky: Hey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Hey.", "Casey: Yo.", "Ricky: So, are you guys tight again, or what?", "Casey: No.", "Jamal: Not in a million years.", "Ricky: Oh, yeah? Then you want to explain it to me? I mean, how come one minute you're all in love and then you're out of love for no good reason that I can see except that you go raiding somebody's closet and kind of flip out? And now you're spending more time together than when you actually were together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reese: I hate it when I'm being messed about!", "Jack: Don't think I ever saw a vampire cry.", "Reese: Shut up!", "Jack: Ooh. Are you sad, or did you just run out of necks to bite on?", "Reese: Which part of \"shut up\" didn't you understand?", "Jack: Sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: You're telling me that you considered making love with Caleb? Is that what it is?", "Lucy: No. That's not what I'm telling you. What I'm telling you is that I was trying to stop him.", "Ian: By seducing him.", "Lucy: I wasn't thinking very clearly. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do because Serena was upstairs in danger and he was going to kill her.", "Ian: I know. And you didn't sleep with him and he didn't hurt you. What happened?", "Lucy: I don't know what happened. I don't know. I do know he had his hand around my neck and he was going to snap it. And then he got this really odd look on his face and he -- he just disappeared.", "Ian: He just left?", "Lucy: He disappeared. He didn't just leave, he somehow just vanished.", "Ian: Ok. The important thing is that you're fine. I'm sorry I wasn't here. Just promise me you're not going to do that again.", "Lucy: I can't promise you that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: Yeah, I know it ain't much, but at least you'll be safe here.", "Tess: Safe from what?", "Caleb: From anybody that would want to hurt you.", "Tess: You mean like Kevin?", "Caleb: For starters. I think if he had his way, he'd get Livvie back for good.", "Tess: Yeah, well, that's what you wanted, too.", "Caleb: That was then, this is now. I want you just the way you are.", "Tess: You know I can't be with you.", "Caleb: Why? Because you think we're so different? Give me a chance to prove you wrong.", "Tess: But --", "Caleb: No tricks. I just want you to be with me forever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Ok, we're busted. We're busted.", "Casey: Jamal --", "Jamal: Hey, hey, hey, he found out we're back together. Ok, why keep up the lie?", "Ricky: Why lie at all?", "Jamal: Because, Ricky, we didn't know exactly where it was headed, so, you know, we didn't want to --", "Casey: To jinx it.", "Jamal: Yeah.", "Casey: Yeah, but, you know, here we are and --", "Jamal: Here we are.", "Casey: And I, like -- I, like, really love this guy. Isn't that right, dude?", "Jamal: That's right, dude.", "Ricky: Yeah. I don't think so.", "Casey: What do you mean? We're telling you we're together.", "Ricky: I don't know. Maybe it's a body language thing. See, when you guys are together, you don't act like a couple, so I'm not buying it.", "Jamal: Ricky, come on. What, what, what, what? Because, what, I respect my lady enough not to have my hands all over her?", "Casey: Yeah.", "Ricky: Yeah. Since when?", "Casey: Since when did you start getting so interested, huh? I mean, it's like you're spying on us or something.", "Jamal: Were you spying?", "Ricky: I've become an observer of human behavior.", "Jamal: Observe this, then.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reese: When I say back off, I mean it!", "Jack: Oh. Sassy. Is this where the fangs come out?", "Reese: What?", "Jack: Oh, I already know. See, I used to be one myself -- a creature of the night. Although, I got to tell you, I didn't like it that much, even though the superhuman strength is kind of cool. Want me to show you a few moves? I can really do some --", "Reese: No, that's all right, I already have. The other night in the park when you lifted that tree off my leg.", "Jack: Right. That was you. Stalling me so Caleb could spend time with my wife. Did I ever congratulate you on that?", "Reese: What for?", "Jack: Well, your plan worked. We split up. That was a nice job. I mean, it's really great work.", "Reese: Yeah, only doing as I'm told, you know?", "Jack: \"Doing as I'm told.\" Where have I heard that? So if Caleb asked you to jump off a building or set your naughty little hairstyle on fire, would you?", "Reese: Not my hair. Hey, it comes with the gig, you know? The big man calls the shots.", "Jack: Kind of like prison, huh? You guys use handcuffs and whips --", "Reese: Has anyone ever told you that you're a real pain in the ass?", "Jack: Yeah. Actually, lots of times. Has anyone ever told you that you're kind of cute, for a batwoman?", "Reese: What is this? What, you coming on to me or something?", "Jack: Why not? I've had it up to here with sweetness and kindness. I could use a little bad to the bone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: Did I say something to upset you?", "Tess: Yes, I'm married -- I'm married to jack and we promised to love each other till death do us part.", "Caleb: But he broke that promise. He hurt you. Maybe I'm wrong, but --", "Tess: No, we had a really bad argument.", "Caleb: About you saving my life? Well, that's just because he doesn't understand your heart.", "Tess: I don't know what to believe anymore.", "Caleb: Tess, believe in yourself. Trust your instincts.", "Tess: Which are telling me maybe I shouldn't be here right now.", "Caleb: Where should you be? With jack? With Kevin?", "Tess: Not Kevin.", "Caleb: What did jack say when you argued? You're spending too much time with me? That you have feelings for me you shouldn't have?", "Tess: Yes.", "Caleb: Did it ever occur to you that maybe he's right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: What are you saying to me?", "Lucy: I'm saying I can't promise you -- I can't -- that I won't use everything in my power to protect you and the ones that I love.", "Ian: I know. What I'm asking you is not to put yourself in a situation like that, that's all.", "Lucy: What, you think I asked to be in this room with that animal? You know, I didn't ask to be a slayer. I didn't ask for this power that if I kiss a vampire, I can distract him for a minute. I didn't ask for that. You know, you don't really know what went on here. You were not here!", "Ian: I know that. I know I wasn't here. I'm are of that.", "Lucy: Well, so -- so what I did was do anything I could think of to protect my family. I -- I would die for you if I had to because that's my job.", "Ian: No, it's not.", "Lucy: Yes, it is. It's my job --", "Ian: No, it's not. It's my job. It's my job to keep you safe. It's the thought of someone else touching you that would kill me.", "Lucy: So, what is this, then? Jealousy?", "Ian: Yeah. Jealousy. That's what it is. It's jealousy. I'm jealous of every moment that you spend in another man's arms, and I'm jealous of all the times you told him that he was the one. And I'm angry that it took me this long to find you. But now that I have, I'm not going anywhere, and I will not allow you to die for me, and that's the end of it.", "Lucy: You -- that's the end of it? That's the end of it. That's the end of it. That's -- so that's it, huh? Do you -- do you have any idea what I try to do -- you don't. All my life, I've tried, you know, to hold my head up high through everything -- through endless nights, stupid, pathetic days, through every attempt at being happy. Every numbing attempt, I have failed at being happy. And now I have a chance, I think. I have fallen in love with you. I have found you. And I love you with everything that is me. And now you're asking me not to be me.", "Ian: I'm not asking that at all.", "Lucy: Please let me finish. I don't have this big -- you know, little notes crumpled up telling me what to do. I don't have a list saying this is how you feel, this is how you act. I don't have that! What I have is my heart! And my heart is telling me that my life is not worth living if you are not in it. And if you can't handle that -- you know what? I want you to get out of here! I need you to get out of my house! Get out! What is it? What are you looking at?", "Ian: A sign from god.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Casey: Hey. That was amazing. Who knew?", "Ricky: You know, for somebody who has been locking lips with this dude for months, you sure do look surprised.", "Casey: It's just that every time with Jamal is like the first time.", "Ricky: That is so lame.", "Casey: We got to take a walk, ok?", "Jamal: Wait, wait, wait. I would rethink that.", "Casey: It's too late, man. Ok, listen, Ricky, I just --", "Ricky: Casey.", "Casey: Shut up and kiss me again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: What do you say? I got you to stop crying. Should be worth something.", "Reese: I don't know if you can handle me, jack. When I get passionate, things happen.", "Jack: When I get passionate, things happen, too.", "Reese: So you want to be a vampire again?", "Jack: Yeah. Why not? What's stopping me?", "Reese: And what about tomorrow, when you sober up?", "Jack: I'm only thinking about tonight. No strings. No tomorrow. What's to stop us?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tess: Caleb, I care about you and I do love you, but I don't think it's the way that you want me to.", "Caleb: When we kissed --", "Tess: It was a wonderful kiss.", "Caleb: It was a kiss that lovers share. I think I know what's in your heart, Tess.", "Tess: And I know what's in yours. It's filled with hate and revenge, and it just wants to make you hurt people that I care about. How can I love you if you hold the desire to kill them inside of you?", "Caleb: What if I don't? What if I don't have that in me? What if something inside of me changed when you saved my life?", "Tess: I'm listening.", "Caleb: Tonight, I had the chance to kill Lucy, but I didn't.", "Tess: Why not?", "Caleb: Because I sensed you were in danger. And it was more important for me to save you then to hurt any of them. I did. I chose love over hate.", "Tess: You did?", "Caleb: I won't force you to stay here, Tess. That's not how I want us to be. You're welcome to stay. That's my hope. But if you choose jack, you're free to go. Choose someone else, you have my blessing. But you decide. You have to listen to your heart and let it choose your own happiness.", "Tess: I have to decide for myself.", "Caleb: I trust you to make the right decision.", "Tess: Jack. He's my husband, and I love him. I know he still loves me. I just -- I can't end it like this. I'm sorry, I have to go.", "Caleb: Go. Go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ricky: Casey, I never thought I'd see you again. The way you disappeared right in front of me. I can't believe it's really you.", "Casey: Baby, you are so fine.", "[Thunder]", "Ricky: No, no, no, no, no! Casey! Oh, man, what did I do?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: You blew her cover. This can't be good, bro.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: Whoo! Yeah.", "Reese: What's so funny?", "Jack: I don't know. You got to admit, it's kind of funny. Two lost souls, stumbling around looking for love in all the wrong places.", "Reese: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said anything about love?", "Jack: Right. Right, right, right, right. Correction -- sex.", "Reese: That's better.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: So this -- this picture in this book --", "Ian: This is what I saw.", "Lucy: This is what you saw because some music made you see it?", "Ian: Not some music, the first five notes of Caleb's \"naked eyes.\"", "Lucy: You know how that song makes me feel. I get so agitated and angry and --", "Ian: Yes, and Rafe is the same way. He goes nuts. I don't know, maybe it's a slayer thing. But when I listen to it, I -- I had this feeling and this vision of this.", "Lucy: Or someplace that just looks like this.", "Ian: No. Not a place that looks like this, this place.", "Lucy: Ok, maybe you've just -- you've been here, you've visited this place.", "Ian: This is not a memory. I've never been here before. I don't know this.", "Lucy: Ok. Ok, let's see, let's see. It's called the healing pool, a hot spring surrounded by legend.", "Ian: What legend?", "Lucy: \"From this pool, the dead return to life.\"", "Ian: Caleb.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[\"Naked eyes\" plays] Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"port Charles: Surrender.\"", "[NEXT_ON]", "jack: I'm sorry you had to see that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tess: But not sorry you did it, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: I know you're trying to get rid of Caleb.
