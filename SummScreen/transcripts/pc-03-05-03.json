        "Joshua pays Elizabeth a visit. He wants her to keep tabs on what Alison and Rafe are up to and report back to him. Elizabeth doesn't like the idea of spying on her daughter, but Joshua convinces her that it's all part of getting sweet revenge on Caleb. He also tries to talk her into a mutual feeding, but Elizabeth doesn't want to do that with him. He ignores her and sinks his fangs into her neck anyway. Jack runs after Tess. He's sorry that she saw him with Reese, but he's not sorry that he did it. They argue about her relationship with Caleb, and Jack informs Tess that he wants to live his life without her. After she leaves, Reese informs Jack that he's too complicated, and she doesn't need that right now. Tess returns to her cave, where she concludes that she doesn't belong anywhere.",
        "Lucy apologizes for the way she treated Ian earlier. Ian thinks the Healing Pool is another piece of the puzzle. They go to Victor for help, and it's a very awkward situation. Lucy apologizes, but Victor explains that when he sees her with Ian, he thinks about Kevin, and it's hard. He's lost his son, and he doesn't know why. As they talk, Ian finds something about the Battle of Putnam's Field in one of Victor's books. Victor now remembers where he's heard of the Healing Pool. According to legend, soldiers who bathed their wounds in the spring were healed. The book doesn't give any additional information, but Victor pulls out some old maps. Although they don't find any pools or springs on the maps, there is a reference in Dutch to a \"place of healthy waters.\" The problem is that they can't tell where it's located, because a piece of the map is missing. Meanwhile, Rafe takes some staff paper and writes out the first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" repeatedly. Alison is angry with him for rejecting her advances. She doesn't think it matters that the music made her want him. Just as Rafe charms his way back into her good graces, Kevin stops by the warehouse to volunteer his services in bringing Caleb down. He wants to get Livvie back as a whole person, and he finally acknowledges that Tess is part of her. Rafe doesn't trust him. Kevin becomes excited when he sees the staff paper, because he sees a message in the notes. He connects the notes into a diagram, but he doesn't know what it means. \"The notes just jumped into my head, and I saw this,\" he states."

        "Lucy: The healing pool?",
        "Ian: The healing pool, yes, and that's all it says. There's no location, nothing. There's no title on this book --",

        "Ian: What?",
        "Lucy: The book -- the healing pool thing? Do you think we can find it?",
        "Ian: Yeah. No, I think it's another piece in the puzzle. And if we can figure it out, maybe we can get rid of this curse forever.",
        "Lucy: Do you know what I think? I think I know somebody that might be able to help us. Come on. Come on, trust me. Let's go.",

        "Rafe: Oh, yeah, it is, but I tried to explain that to you.",
        "Alison: I know. I know. You explained it. You think that Caleb's music affected me somehow. But even if it did, I still wanted you, you know what I mean? So it doesn't really make a difference. Like, who cares?",
        "Rafe: So what, you want to file for a divorce?",
        "Alison: Maybe I do.",
        "Rafe: Right, ok, even though we're not officially married yet.",

        "Elizabeth: Well, yes.",
        "Joshua: I realize why you did that. You thought you'd been cured, defanged, unvamped. I understand. Really, I do, my sweet, but you see, you were wrong. You're still one of us, and what you have to do is to learn to live with it.",
        "Elizabeth: I hate this. It's just I would rather be dead. I actually tried killing myself.",
        "Joshua: Of course, you failed at that, too. What you have to learn to do is just you have to relax and enjoy the benefits.",
        "Elizabeth: \"Benefits.\"",
        "Joshua: One thing, we never grow old, and we have this insatiable appetite for passion.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, I know, I know. I didn't say that everything was bad, but -- speaking of things that never grow old, but got old real quick, how's -- how's your friend Caleb?",
        "Joshua: Well, you know, the same old tricks. You know his motto -- \"eternity and endless women,\" with every tick of the clock --",
        "Elizabeth: Ok -- ok, just -- I know you keep telling me about his affairs, hoping to turn me completely agagainst him, but I asked you a simple question -- how is he? What is the truth?",
        "Joshua: You want the brutal truth? He never loved you. He had many lovers -- before you, during you, and after you.",
        "Elizabeth: You know what? Never mind. I really don't care anyway.",
        "Joshua: Of course you do. Especially with what I am going to propose to you -- give you the chance to get even with Mr. Caleb Morley -- or should I say the artist previously known as Stephen Clay.",
        "Elizabeth: How?",
        "Joshua: I hear your lovely daughter, Alison, and the slayer Rafe and their little gaggle of tedious friends are planning to attack Stephen. What we need to know is --",
        "Elizabeth: You honestly think that I'm going to spy on my daughter for you?",
        "Joshua: I have absolutely no doubt that you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: So you say you want to help us get rid of Caleb. How?",
        "Kevin: My expertise in dealing with the pathology of the twisted mind. I know Caleb's pretzel really well.",
        "Alison: Why would you want to help us now? What's in it for you?",
        "Kevin: Getting my daughter back, Alison. I'll do anything I have to to make that happen.",
        "Rafe: Meaning you'll get rid of Tess?",
        "Kevin: You want to get rid of Caleb. So what? You know, getting my daughter back and getting rid of the pointy-tooth fairy is a goal that we can all share, isn't it? And for the record, I don't want to destroy Tess at all. I want my daughter back. I want Livvie back. All of her, not this stranger that Tess is. I want the person that Tess is only a part of. And my daughter, the person you used to call your best friend, deserves to exist as a complete person, all of her.",
        "Rafe: Well, you're not exactly the person you used to be, either.",
        "Alison: Rafe --",
        "Rafe: No, you know what? I don't know what side you're on, all right? Not after all the people you hurt, especially Lucy. For all I know, this could be just one big trick.",
        "Kevin: Sounds like a dismissal.",
        "Alison: Kevin, why don't I show you the door.",
        "Kevin: No, really, I can see it from here. I think I'll find my way out. At least I tried. I' done everything that --",
        "Rafe: Hey, get your hands off that!",
        "Alison: Wait, wait, wait. What? What do you think that is, Kevin?",
        "Kevin: I know what this is. Can't you see that?",
        "Rafe: What do you see?",
        "Kevin: There's a message here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: Lucy, I'm not disappointed in you. I -- it's -- it's more complex. It's --",
        "Lucy: What? What is it?",
        "Victor: It's life, that's all. You are entitled to every bit of happiness you can find. It's just that when I see you and Ian together, all I can think of is --",
        "Lucy: Kevin.",
        "Victor: I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know who he is, I've lost my son, and -- and I don't know why. I don't know -- as a parent, you think --",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Victor: Well, I haven't always been the best parent, the best father to -- to Monk, but in the past few years, I -- I've worked very hard, and the past few years have been so good --",
        "Lucy: They were. They were real good.",
        "Victor: And whenever I think of you, I think of your wedding and the wonderful future that --",
        "Lucy: Please don't do that. I can't think like that anymore. I don't anymore. I tried so hard. I hope you know how hard I tried to make everything right.",
        "Victor: Lucy, I've never been able to blame you, and certainly not now. I know what Monk did, and I know what he's still doing, and --",
        "Ian: That's it!",
        "Victor: What?",
        "Lucy: What is it?",
        "Ian: Right here -- the battle of Putnam's field.",
        "Victor: Oh, that's right, Putnam's from 1775. That's right, the legend was that the soldiers who bathed their wounds in this spring were healed.",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait. What you're saying is there was some miraculous hot spring, some healing pool right here in Port Charles?",
        "Victor: Local lore has it that that's why the hospital was established here. I mean, people use to come and bathe in the waters and hope for a cure.",
        "Lucy: So, what else does the book say? Anything else?",
        "Ian: Nothing. That's all it says. That's all we got.",
        "Lucy: But that's not good. No, we got -- that's not enough. Victor, there's got to be something else, right? I mean, if that's all we got, then we got nothing.",
        "Victor: Maybe --",
        "Lucy: What? What is it? Maybe what?",
        "Victor: Maybe there is something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Look, I know what you wanted. I know you wanted to help, but you can't heal me.",
        "Tess: I can.",
        "Jack: Oh, just like you did Caleb? Tess, come on. What we had was special. Your powers -- they were special until you went and tried to save that monster.",
        "Tess: But he's not a monster.",
        "Jack: Oh, excuse me. Sorry -- your lover.",
        "Tess: No.",
        "Jack: Bye, Tess. I just want to live my life without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Look at it this way. You won't be spying on Alison. You'll just be rooting out information that will help you get revenge on the man who lied to you and abused you.",
        "Elizabeth: That doesn't justify betraying my own daughter.",
        "Joshua: All right. Well, it's like giving Alison the opportunity to help you to get revenge on a man who promised you an eternity of love and then broke his promise to you. That's something that I would never do.",
        "Elizabeth: What, you don't make promises?",
        "Joshua: Never make them, never break them. I don't tell lies. You and I have the same goal, Elizabeth -- we want control.",
        "Elizabeth: Control?",
        "Joshua: Control of our lives and the lives of certain little insignificants that are buzzing around us. The thing is to keep your eye on the prize. The reward will be unspeakably sweet.",
        "Elizabeth: And all I have to do --",
        "Joshua: Is to watch Alison and Rafe and their merry little band and find out what they're up to. And I promis-- I guarantee you the revenge -- it'll be satisfyingly full on Caleb Morley.",
        "Elizabeth: I do like the sound of that.",
        "Joshua: I had a feeling that you would. And speaking about \"satisfyingly full,\" I recall there were certain little aspects of vampire life that you found rather appealing.",
        "Elizabeth: No, I promised I would never do that again, not with you.",
        "Joshua: Promises, promises. I'm all you have, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no. Oh, no, don't. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Good-bye, Tess. Hello, whatever.",
        "Reese: You talking to me?",
        "Jack: Reese. Hey. I could use one of these. Is this for me?",
        "Reese: Guess again, baby.",
        "Jack: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm tired of guessing. Now, tell me, where were we?",
        "Reese: Oh, nowhere. You're way too complicated. Way, way too complicated, and that's the last thing I need right now. Ciao.",
        "Jack: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're kidding me, right?",
        "Reese: Just keep laughing, Jack. Thanks for the beer and the memories. Maybe some other time, if you're lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Home.",
        "Tess: Oh, Jack. There's no happy endings for us ever after. Now where do I go? Where do I belong? Nowhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Kevin, what --",
        "Rafe: Shh, shh.",
        "Alison: What is he doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: Maybe these will help, but please be very careful. Some of them are quite old.",
        "Lucy: Old? Old what?",
        "Victor: Old maps of the area, drawn long before there was a Port Charles, even at the time of the original village.",
        "Ian: And you think this can help us?",
        "Victor: Well, it couldn't hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Here. It's finished.",
        "Alison: With what? What is that?",
        "Rafe: It's a good question. You say this is some sort of message?",
        "Kevin: There it is.",
        "Alison: Oh, there what is? I don't understand.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but what is this? What -- what do you see here? What do you -- what do you think this leads to?",
        "Kevin: I don't know. The notes just jumped into my head, and I saw this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: This is like looking at a needle in a haystack. There's no pools or any springs.",
        "Victor: These are the only maps I've got.",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. What -- what is this?",
        "Ian: What?",
        "Lucy: It's some sort of fancy writing, but -- look at that. It's not in english. What could that be?",
        "Victor: You're right, Lucy. It's not english. It's dutch. [Speaking dutch] It means \"place of healthy waters.\" It must mean that the hot springs is there. You found it.",
        "Lucy: Found -- there? But where? I mean, you can't tell because, look, there's a piece missing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Joshua: Then it's time you put on your best mommy-dearest face and pay little Alison and Rafe a visit.",
        "Lucy: Do you really think there could be some sort of healing spring for vampires under Caleb's building?",
        "Ian: There's only one way to find out.",
