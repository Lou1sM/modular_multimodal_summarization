        "Elizabeth flirts with Frank at the Recovery Room. Frank places a cryptic phone call in which he assures someone that he's good for the money. Joshua advises Elizabeth to start spying on Alison and Rafe now. Frank intervenes when he sees Joshua grab her arm. Joshua is impressed with Frank, but the feeling is far from mutual. Assessing what he's observed, Joshua believes that Frank could be quite an asset to him. Caleb comforts a very sad Tess in the cave where she used to live. She wishes that Jack had never taken her away and taught her about love. She blames Caleb for creating her in the first place. Caleb explains that all the time he was pining for Olivia, he never took the time to look at Tess. When he finally opened his heart, he realized that she was the one he longed for. He is her destiny, not Jack. Tess looks into his eyes and realizes that he really does love her. Rafe and Alison are still trying to decipher Kevin's drawing when Ian and Lucy burst with maps of Port Charles and news about the healing pool. Ian and Lucy lay the drawing over one of the maps and discover that it points to Caleb's building by the docks. However, when they learn that Kevin supplied the drawing, they become suspicious that it's a trap. Despite his apparently good intentions, Kevin is asked to leave the premises. Elizabeth stops by the warehouse just before Ian and Lucy leave. When Alison and Rafe can't get their stories straight, Elizabeth informs them that she knows they're up to something that has to do with her husband. Caleb and Tess walk to his place, where he promises to protect her from her nightmares. As Ian and Lucy snoop around the docks, they find the same pattern on a padlocked door. To their chagrin, Kevin joins them. When they hear Caleb approaching, they open the lock and hide inside. Caleb notices the open padlock and closes it before continuing his walk with Tess. Inside, Ian stifles Lucy's urge to scream. She's normally claustrophic anyway, but it doesn't help that Kevin is in there with them."

        "Elizabeth: Mmm, thank you. Now, where was I?",
        "Frank: You were saying something about feeling worthless.",
        "Elizabeth: No. I don't know, maybe it's just me. I just have a way of attracting the ones that are all wrong for me, you know. I just seem to be a magnet no matter what, they find me.",
        "Frank: Hey, you can do better, huh? Don't give up.",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you. You are such a good listener. And handsome I might add. What -- what was your name?",
        "Frank: Frank. You're Elizabeth Barrington, right? I -- I recognized you.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, that's so flattering. Thank you.",
        "Frank: I -- you know, I need to make a call.",
        "Joshua: Sorry. I don't think he's interested.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I'm not, either. Get lost.",
        "Joshua: Don't you think you've had enough?",
        "Elizabeth: Believe me, there is not enough alcohol in the world to make me forget what we did tonight.",
        "Joshua: Oh, really? With all those little squeaks and moans you were making, I thought you rather enjoyed yourself.",
        "Frank: I'm good for the money, all right? I'll get it. Don't worry, I'll get it.",
        "Joshua: Now, you said you needed time. You've had time. Put down the martini and get busy. Petulance is so unbecoming. You do still want to destroy Caleb, don't you?",
        "Elizabeth: Yes, of course I do.",
        "Joshua: All right. So does your future son-in-law. It is time you put on your best mommy dearest face and pay little Alison and Rafe a visit. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, let's go over this again. Now, the first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" have a very strange affect on people when you listen to them over and over.",
        "Alison: Right, right, right. And they make you want to strangle Ian, and they make me want to make love to you, although that's really nothing new.",
        "Rafe: But it's different.",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rafe: You know it is, all right? Now, Ian -- when he listens it, he sees some sort of oasis.",
        "Alison: I know. He said something like a hot spring, so --",
        "Rafe: Now, Kevin -- he took the notes and made some kind of pattern out of it. Now, I have no idea what it means, but --",
        "Alison: Well, maybe we're just -- you know, maybe we're just looking at this upside down or something.",
        "Rafe: If we figure this out --",
        "Alison: We will, we will, we will.",
        "Rafe: If we do, we might actually be able to get rid of the vampires.",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Lucy: You know how I was always telling you guys about how the universe always works in very mysterious ways? Well, it's done it again.",
        "Ian: We found something.",
        "Alison: Ok, wait.",
        "Lucy: We found this book --",
        "Ian: We found it --",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah --",
        "Alison: Whoa. What book?",
        "Ian: There's a healing spring right here in Port Charles.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Ian: We found a partial map, anyway.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. What is that?",
        "Alison: What? What?",
        "Ian: Let me see that.",
        "Lucy: Look at that shape. Wait. Look at ours.",
        "Ian: Come and look at something. Ok, this is -- this is the old map, the partial map of Port Charles.",
        "Alison: Yeah?",
        "Lucy: This is the modern map. We got them from Victor. This is what Port Charles looks like now. This is way back. I got it. Look at this.",
        "Ian: Now, if this --",
        "Lucy: That matches -- wait. Turn it around, turn it around.",
        "Lucy: Ok, you see that line? It matches perfectly. Where does it go?",
        "Ian: It doesn't go anywhere. It just stops right here.",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. The five notes of that song -- what does it do? When you heard it, what did it do? Did it keep going, or did it stop?",
        "Rafe: You have to repeat it on a loop.",
        "Lucy: Repeat it on a loop --",
        "Ian: Let's try something. What are you looking at? What is this?",
        "Lucy: Waterfront, the docks.",
        "Rafe: And who lives near the docks?",
        "Lucy: Caleb.",
        "Ian: Where did you get this?",
        "Kevin: From me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Tess -- don't be afraid. It's just me. It's just me. I'm here. I'm here with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Well, this is cozy.",
        "Ian: Why are you here?",
        "Kevin: Same as you, I suppose. To defang the big bat. Any objections?",
        "Lucy: The objection is you're not supposed to be anywhere near me.",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I came to see Rafe. How could I possibly know that you'd show up with your boyfriend?",
        "Rafe: Lucy, we told Kevin we didn't need his help, but then he took the notes and made them into this pattern. Obviously, they're a missing part of the puzzle.",
        "Ian: How did you come to draw that?",
        "Lucy: Kevin, did Caleb give you that information?",
        "Kevin: And here I thought you'd only lost your mind like I said, I came here to help get the bastard.",
        "Lucy: And you expect me to believe you?",
        "Kevin: I don't care if you believe me or not. It's the truth.",
        "Ian: I asked you a question. How did you come to draw --",
        "Kevin: I don't know! All I did was connect dots on a piece of paper. Musical notes on a music sheet.",
        "Lucy: I can't trust him.",
        "Kevin: I came here in good faith. I thought we were all fighting the same fight, and I thought destroying evil might be a little more important than upsetting Lucy.",
        "Ian: Well, thanks for your help. Now you can go home.",
        "Lucy: Please. If you really want to help, Kevin, just go.",
        "Kevin: You have no idea the pleasure I derive from granting your every wish. Lovely to see you two birds.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: This is no place for you, Tess. Come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "Tess: No, just leave me alone.",
        "Caleb: You don't belong here anymore, sweetheart. But I can wait all day. You can't shut me out, and I'm not leaving you here.",
        "Tess: Why didn't Jack leave me here when he found me? I was scared and alone and sometimes frightened, but I didn't hurt the way I now.",
        "Caleb: Why don't you let me help you?",
        "Tess: Help me? This is all your fault. You created me. Why did you have to do that? Look at me, pretending to be real when I'm nothing.",
        "Caleb: You know that's not true.",
        "Tess: What's true is I hurt and I've hurt Jack.",
        "Caleb: No. Jack's the reason you're hiding in this cave right now.",
        "Tess: When he first brought me home, it was so wonderful and I had all these really beautiful feelings inside.",
        "Caleb: Then he changed, didn't he?",
        "Tess: You don't know what he was like in the beginning. He was so loving. And every day was filled with so much excitement. I wanted -- I wanted to be in his world so badly. I wanted to be a part of it.",
        "Caleb: But you can't, can you Tess?",
        "Tess: Because I'm different.",
        "Caleb: You are better than all of them. You have a gift inside you. You can heal.",
        "Tess: What good is it if I can't heal myself? I've got all this -- I've got all this pain inside, and I know it won't go away, no matter what I do. It just won't go away.",
        "Caleb: You know, I don't have the same powers you have, but I think I can make you feel better.",
        "Tess: No, I want to go back to before I knew what love was. If this is what it's like to live in this world, then I don't want it. I don't. I don't want it. Please. Please help me go back. Please.",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry. We're stuck. You can't go back to living in that cave any more than I can go back to living my life without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Why am I taking orders from you? What am I doing with you at all?",
        "Joshua: Well, for now, I'm all you've got.",
        "Elizabeth: Every time I think I hit rock bottom, I just slide a little further and there you are.",
        "Joshua: Why don't we focus on trying to get rid of Caleb and stop obsessing on your pathetic love life.",
        "Elizabeth: I deserve someone who loves me.",
        "Joshua: Love has only made you miserable. That's why you and I are perfect together. You don't love me, and I sure as hell don't love you.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, there's a glorious illustration. I'd kill myself if I weren't already dead.",
        "Joshua: Oh, stop whining. It's so unflattering. Why don't you look on the bright side. Together we can have everything. We can have power, money, and sex. And, hey, you won't have to worry about whether I call you in the morning. Why don't you listen to me? You'll have a chance to get back some of your pride. That way you won't end up being eternity's prettiest doormat.",
        "Frank: Hey, is there a problem here?",
        "Joshua: No, there's no problem. The lady and I are having a very friendly conversation.",
        "Frank: Then get your hands off her. This guy giving you a hard time, Elizabeth?",
        "Elizabeth: He just can't seem to take no for an answer.",
        "Frank: Maybe you should walk out of here, pal, before I throw you out.",
        "Joshua: Is that anyway to talk to a paying customer?",
        "Frank: Then the drink is on the house. Now, get out -- now.",
        "Elizabeth: Sorry, but that won't really be necessary. I'm leaving anyway. Thank you, Frank. I appreciate that. There aren't many gentlemen left in the world.",
        "Frank: If you even try to go after her, I will throw you through this wall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Hey, listen, I know Kevin really bothers you guys.",
        "Ian: It's a little more than that.",
        "Rafe: But we got to focus on our number one priority here.",
        "Lucy: You're right. You're absolutely right.",
        "Alison: Ok, so what did you guys find out?",
        "Ian: According to legend, there's a healing spring right here in Port Charles.",
        "Lucy: Right. And if that map is correct, that means it's under Caleb's building.",
        "Ian: And it means it's not just a legend. We've got this partial map thing here and then -- and then this, Kevin's drawn out the notes to the music.",
        "Lucy: Right, Caleb's song. So that means it could be right at Caleb's door.",
        "Alison: So is this some sort of a healing spring? Maybe a power source for vampires?",
        "Rafe: It could be. Or maybe it's just a trap.",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah. I mean, Kevin did sort of conveniently hand it over, didn't he?",
        "Ian: You think Caleb is working with Kevin and they're trying to set us up?",
        "Rafe: Well, we obviously have to consider that, don't we?",
        "Ian: Which is why you're going to stay here where it's safe while I check this out.",
        "Lucy: Uh-uh.",
        "Ian: Or come with me. Whatever you like.",
        "Lucy: I'll come with you.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Elizabeth: Hello, Rafe. Oh, wow. Good evening, all. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?",
        "Alison: No. No. We're just going to go to a thing. Why don't we -- we should meet you guys.",
        "Lucy: I think we should go do our thing first.",
        "Alison: Because I don't want to make you late.",
        "Ian: Come on.",
        "Lucy: Ok. See you.",
        "Alison: Ok, see you.",
        "Lucy: Elizabeth, it's really swell seeing you. Cousin. Ok, tell me something. If these maps are real, if they're right, do you really think there could be some sort of healing spring for vampires under Caleb's building?",
        "Ian: There's only one way to find out.",
        "Lucy: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I hate to see you so unhappy. But maybe it was necessary to go through this pain.",
        "Tess: Why?",
        "Caleb: Because everything we witness, everything we experience changes us.",
        "Tess: Well, it's changed me for the worse because I hate how I feel.",
        "Caleb: You don't think I hated it when you wouldn't bring Livvie back?",
        "Tess: That's because you loved her.",
        "Caleb: I did. As much -- maybe more than you loved Jack. So much that I never really looked at you. I never saw how beautiful you are. I never really felt your touch. But when I finally did, when I opened my heart, I realized wt I'd been longing for. It's you, Tess.",
        "Tess: No. I was born to be with Jack. That's what he told me.",
        "Caleb: It's a good line. But he isn't your destiny. I am. You know, I think we both needed to just get lost a little in order to find each other.",
        "Tess: You really believe that?",
        "Caleb: You brought my heart salvation, and I believe you were put on this earth to save me, just as I was brought back to love you.",
        "Tess: You really do love me. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Caleb: It's the kind of love that lasts forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I'm not going to say it again. Do not go after the lady.",
        "Joshua: You use the term loosely, which is appropriate when it comes to Elizabeth. She's the kind of woman -- she drinks too much and she thinks too little. She creates drama wherever she goes. I'm sure you know the type.",
        "Frank: I know your type. You get your kicks putting women down.",
        "Joshua: Oh, believe me, Elizabeth -- she is trouble.",
        "Frank: And you look like you're the cause of her trouble.",
        "Joshua: Well, it's very noble to fight for what you believe in. I would bet you've never walked away from a confrontation in your life. I'm very impressed. I'm Joshua Temple.",
        "Joshua: Rude, tough, quick with his fists. Mmm, that's perfect. And he makes a good drink. He's the sort of man that could be an asset to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: So it sounded like you guys were all planning something.",
        "Rafe: No, we're just on our way out to dinner.",
        "Alison: Yeah, a movie.",
        "Elizabeth: Which one?",
        "Rafe: Well, dinner --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Then a movie.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, yes. Something tells me that this is actually about Caleb.",
        "Alison: Mother, please, give it a rest, ok? Not everything is about vampires.",
        "Elizabeth: Sweetheart, you're not a very effective liar, but that was a good try.",
        "Rafe: You know what? That's it. Get out of here.",
        "Elizabeth: Come on. I know that you guys are hiding something. Caleb is my almost ex-husband. If you have found something out about him, I have the right to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Do you see anything?",
        "Ian: Nothing.",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Look at that door thingy.",
        "Ian: It's the same pattern we saw on the drawing.",
        "Lucy: It is. Don't you think that's got to mean something?",
        "Ian: Let's check it out.",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "Lucy: I hear something. I don't have a good feeling about this. I definitely hear something.",
        "Ian: Now we know why.",
        "Caleb: You know, I -- I never really enjoyed just walking before.",
        "Tess: Yeah, the air does feel good. It's just my whole life is turned upside down right now. I don't know what to think, where to go.",
        "Kevin: Fancy meeting you here. I heard there were rats at the docks.",
        "Ian: We're a little busy here, Collins.",
        "Caleb: No one's asking you to make any decisions. Just breathe.",
        "Ian: I've got to get in here before Caleb finds us.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, that would be bad.",
        "Caleb: I want to make sure you get a good night's sleep. You'll feel better in the morning, I promise.",
        "Tess: I'm almost afraid to close my eyes. I've had such bad nightmares.",
        "Caleb: I'll be right there, chasing the bad dreams away.",
        "Lucy: He locked us in. We're locked in.",
        "Ian: Yeah, it's locked.",
        "Lucy: I really thought for a minute that you were going to blow the whistle on us.",
        "Kevin: And miss out on all this fun -- skulking around in here with you and your boyfriend?",
        "Ian: Why don't you get a life for yourself.",
        "Kevin: You know, funny thing, Ian. I had a life until you came along and decided yet again that I had a wife that you couldn't stay away from.",
        "Lucy: Could you just stop it? Please, just stop it!",
        "Kevin: You're getting claustrophobic, aren't you?",
        "Lucy: You know I hate small spaces like this, especially in this particular situation.",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe the universe is speaking to you, Lucy, because we're stuck in here together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Surrender.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Elizabeth: I really want to be part of it. I mean, please just tell me that I can work with you.",
        "Kevin: What is this godforsaken place, and what are we supposed to be looking for?",
        "Tess: I want the best part of you to make love to the best part of me."
