        "Livvie: Bye. ",
        "Jack: Oh, you got to be kidding me. ",
        "[Livvie sighs] ",
        "Livvie: What? That's how easy it is for me to walk away. ",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Jack: You think I believe you just didn't feel anything right now? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, do me a favor, Jack, and get over yourself. ",

        "Eve: Ian, don't do this. Come on, wake up. ",
        "Chief: Ah. You're awake. Well, why didn't anybody tell me? Ian? He's not -- ",
        "Maya: No, he hasn't come back. ",
        "Chief: It's just as I thought. He was given too much of the morca. ",
        "Maya: He had exactly the same as Eve. ",
        "Eve: Maya said that wherever he is, something is holding him there. It's very \r\npowerful -- so powerful that -- ",
        "Chief: He may never come back. ",
        "Eve: My God, there must be something we can do. ",
        "Maya: There is one possible hope. ",
        "Eve: What? What is it? ",
        "Maya: Though even that -- the thing that's bound both of you together since \r\nfar back in time -- your love for each other. ",
        "Eve: Our love? ",
        "Maya: Talk to him, Eve. Reach him however you can, before it's too late. ",
        "Eve: Ian, come back to me. Don't leave me, please. ",
        "",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Ian: I can't let you go. Not now. How can I? We -- we've only just found each \r\nother. I won't let you go. ",
        "Eve's Voice: I love you. Come back to me. Come back to me now. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Come on, Nellie, work! What is it with you? Here I go out and buy you \r\nthis sleek new monitor and this is how you thank me? Oh, I know. You want me to \r\nsweet-talk you, is that it? Yeah, you girls are a pushover for that. Karen sure \r\nwas on the phone this morning. But I can't think about that now -- not without a \r\nsurge protector. So come on, baby. Daddy wants to get your hard drive humming, \r\nfire up those integrated circuits -- at the very least, turn you on. Come on.\r\n",
        "Arianna: Frank? ",
        "Frank: Arianna. Hi. I -- ",
        "Arianna: Hi. ",
        "Frank: I bet you're wondering what I was doing here. ",
        "Arianna: No. No, no, not at all. ",
        "Frank: See, the thing is I've been trying to get this old computer running --\r\n",
        "Arianna: Oh. ",
        "Frank: And I -- never mind. Is there something I can do for you? ",
        "Arianna: Yeah -- I wanted to get your ok on something. I'd like to fix up the \r\nbasement apartment. ",
        "Frank: Fix it up? ",
        "Arianna: Yeah, you know -- maybe just a fresh coat of paint, some new tiles \r\nfor the bathroom. See, the INS, they're still coming around, checking up, and \r\nI'm afraid that if they're not going to believe my marriage to Ian is real, \r\nthey'll deport me. ",
        "Frank: And making the place homier might help. ",
        "Arianna: What do you think? ",
        "Frank: Honestly, I'm not so sure it's a great idea. ",
        "Arianna: Oh. ",
        "Frank: Look, I might as well tell you -- I've been a little uneasy about this \r\nwhole situation ever since Neil got back. ",
        "Arianna: If you're worried about Ben, he's -- ",
        "Frank: I know, I know, he's gone, but if your brother or one of his pals come \r\nback -- ",
        "Arianna: You have to think of your son's safety. ",
        "Frank: And yours. And living someplace else might give you that heads-up time \r\nyou need. ",
        "Arianna: I never thought of that. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. I think I might know just the place. ",

        "[Door opens] ",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not walking away this time. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, could you be any more annoying? ",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm just getting warmed up, thank you. ",
        "Livvie: What is your problem? Why can't you just accept that I am not \r\ninterested in you? ",
        "Jack: Look, stop acting like you don't care because I know you do. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, you know that, huh? ",
        "Jack: Why else would you be here? ",
        "Livvie: I already told you. ",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, yeah -- I forgot. Some lame excuse about losing some letter.\r\n",
        "Livvie: It's the truth. ",
        "Jack: Right, right. So you don't call Alison, and you just happen to come all \r\nthe way over here where, coincidentally, I just happen to live. Must be an \r\nimportant letter. ",
        "Livvie: Gosh, it was my application for pre-med. I would say that's pretty \r\nimportant! ",
        "Jack: Hey -- pre-med? ",
        "Livvie: It's just something I had thought about. I really wasn't going to \r\nmail it. ",
        "Jack: Studying medicine -- you want to be a doctor. ",
        "Livvie: What, is that so hard to believe? ",
        "Jack: No, I mean -- I -- I just had no idea. ",
        "Livvie: And you knew everything there was to know about me. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I guess not everything. ",
        "Livvie: No, you know nothing. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I know that you belong with me. I don't blame you for being \r\nupset about the whole Lucy thing. ",
        "Livvie: You know what? I am -- I am so past that. That is gone. ",
        "Jack: Oh, bull. Bull. You're madder than hell. You're mad enough to go date \r\nmy brother just to get back at me. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, everything's not about you, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Ok, maybe not. But you just can't stand here and pretend that we don't \r\nbelong together. You're just too stubborn to admit that. ",
        "Livvie: There you go again -- telling me what you think you know about me.\r\n",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm telling you that this isn't over. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Livvie: Hello? Chris. Hi. No, no, I'm here. I'm just -- I'm thinking about \r\nhow glad I am you called. And -- and, yeah, I really miss you and I'd love to \r\nsee you. The Recovery Room? Yeah, that sounds great. I'm on my way. I've got to \r\ngo. ",
        "Jack: This is what you want. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, it's exactly the way I want it. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Please. Listen to me, my love. I have so much to tell you. I know where \r\nyou are because I was there, too. I know what happened between us, and I know \r\nhow devastated you must be because you think you lost me. But you haven't. I'm \r\nhere. So many lifetimes have passed, and we're still together. Our souls belong \r\ntogether. Then, now, and always. Please tell me you can hear me. Please give me \r\na sign. I need you here with me in this world, in this time. So you have to let \r\ngo. Do you hear me? Just -- let -- go. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I can't let go. I won't. This is my life. This is my life. ",
        "Eve's Voice: But I'm waiting for you right here. Our love never died. It \r\nlives on. It will always live on. But only -- only if you come back and claim \r\nit. Why won't you talk to me? I know you can hear me. I know it. Damn it! Talk \r\nto me! Just think of what we've gone through to find our way back to each other. \r\nAnd if you think that I'm going to let you skip out on me now, well, you'd \r\nbetter think again! There's no way I'm going to let you back out of this -- not \r\nnow. Please. I'm begging you. Come back to me. Come back to me. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh, my God. I was so afraid. ",

        "Chris: Oh. ",
        "Livvie: Glad you could get away. I've been missing you. ",
        "Chris: Wow. I don't know what I did to deserve this, but I'm liking it. ",
        "Livvie: Deserve what? ",
        "Chris: Well, you, this warm greeting. ",
        "Livvie: Well, let's just say that I've been thinking, and I think I finally \r\nrealized just what and who I want in my life. ",
        "Chris: Hmm. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. It's also an amazing \r\ncoincidence. ",
        "Livvie: Well, what do you mean? ",
        "Chris: Well, have a seat. One of the reasons I called you was to talk to you \r\n-- ",
        "Jack: Hey, sweetheart. Howdy, big bro. How you doing? ",
        "Livvie: Do you mind? We are trying to have a conversation here. ",
        "Jack: Trying. I get that -- that's funny. Well, let me help you out because \r\nI'm sure you've been bored ever since you got here. ",
        "Livvie: You are -- are just really beyond obnoxious. ",
        "Chris: Listen, Jack, I was here to talk to Livvie about something that \r\naffects her future. ",
        "Jack: Well, shoot away, big bro, because I'm a part of that future whether \r\nyou like it or not. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I don't like it, and I don't want you here. Got it? ",
        "Jack: Sure. But that's not what I got when you laid that big, sweet kiss on \r\nme earlier. ",

        "Frank: Ok. Here's the address where Courtney and I were living. ",
        "Arianna: And the loft is really just sitting there empty? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. I couldn't get out of the lease, so it works out great for both \r\nof us. ",
        "Arianna: This is incredible. How can I ever thank you? ",
        "Frank: Don't worry about it. Ian taking over the rent is thanks enough. ",
        "Arianna: Well, when can we move in? ",
        "Frank: Anytime. The blue key is for the bottom lock, the silver is for the \r\ndeadbolt, and you have to jiggle it a bit -- it sticks. ",
        "Arianna: Ian's going to be so surprised. Yeah, we finally have a real home, \r\njust for the two of us. ",

        "Chief: He's awake. ",
        "Maya: You were able to call him back. ",
        "Eve: It was just like you said. We were together at the exact same time, \r\nhaving the exact same dream. ",
        "Chief: It was no dream. We believe you were there. ",
        "Maya: And you have seen your destiny -- a love that can never be broken. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: I can't even describe to you the pain I felt when I -- ",
        "Eve: Shh. No, no, no, no, no. It's ok. It's ok. We're together now. ",
        "Ian: I will never take you for granted -- not one minute, not one second. ",
        "Eve: Do you remember how I told you that I was afraid to go back to Port \r\nCharles? I'm not afraid anymore because I know that nothing can come between us.\r\n",

        "Jack: Livvie, why are you trying to deny that we made out at the bike shop?\r\n",
        "Livvie: This is not going to work, Jack. Chris is way too smart to believe \r\nyou. ",
        "Chris: You got that right. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, we both know what happened, and we both know what you're \r\nfeeling. I'm sorry, Chris, you never will. Got to run, guys. ",
        "Chris: Don't let him get to you. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, he's not getting to me. He's just so -- ",
        "Chris: Irritating. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. So, what was it you were going to say before -- before -- ",
        "Chris: Before we were so rudely interrupted? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Something about my future, or -- ",
        "Chris: Yeah. It is. Look, I did something that maybe I shouldn't have done.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Well, what is it? ",
        "Chris: I submitted your name to the pre-med program at PC University and \r\nwrote you a letter of recommendation. Now, before you say anything, here's all \r\nthe information on it. Look it over, see what you think, and -- I knew it. I \r\nshouldn't have done this. Livvie, I'm sorry. It's just -- I got to thinking the \r\nother day about how smart and compassionate and caring you are, and -- I don't \r\nknow, I just think you'd make a great doctor. ",
        "Livvie: I cannot believe this. ",
        "Chris: I know, I know. It's presumptuous. I'm sorry. I apologize. I can pull your name. \r\nIt's really not a problem. ",
        "Livvie: No, no. How did you know? How did you know? This is exactly what I've \r\nbeen thinking about. ",
        "Chris: You have? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I was going to send the application in myself, but I lost it. \r\nYou didn't happen to find it, did you? ",
        "Chris: Me? No, of course not. Well, you gave me the idea, actually. ",
        "Livvie: What? When? ",
        "Chris: Well, the other day when I fixed Jack's dislocated shoulder, you said \r\nsomething about how you wish you could help people like that. I put two and two \r\ntogether, and -- still, you know what? I shouldn't have taken it upon myself to \r\ndo this. I'm sorry. I apologize. ",
        "Livvie: No. Don't be sorry. This is my dream, and you knew it. I mean, do you \r\nreally think I can? ",

        "Frank: Oh-oh. You are killing me, Nellie. I finally get you to boot, and what \r\ndo you do? You freeze on me. Oh. And on top of that, you've made me late for \r\nwork. ",

        "Ian: The plane's on time. ",
        "Eve: Oh. For once, I'm not so happy to hear that. ",
        "Ian: We'll be back. And that time there'll be nothing and no one that will \r\nkeep us from staying as long as we want. ",
        "Eve: I love you so much. I wish we could start our life right here, right \r\nnow. ",
        "Ian: It might be sooner than you think. ",
        "Eve: What? What have you got planned, Thornhart? ",
        "Ian: I've got an idea to keep Arianna safe that doesn't involve me being her \r\nhusband. ",
        "Eve: How? ",
        "Ian: I have some friends that can help me find a new identity for her and a \r\nnew place to live. ",
        "Eve: You mean like the Witness Protection Program? Well, then -- then you'll \r\nbe free! ",
        "Ian: Yes, and Arianna will be safe. We can go wherever our hearts will take \r\nus. ",
        "Eve: Oh, as long as it's with you, I don't care where it is. ",
        "Chief: Ian? Eve? May I enter? ",

        "Eve: Come in. ",
        "Chief: I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's something I need to speak with you \r\nabout -- the both of you. ",
        "Ian: That sounds serious. ",
        "Chief: We've known each other a long time, Ian. In all those years, I've never \r\nseen you so happy. ",
        "Ian: I've never been this happy. ",
        "Chief: In this beautiful, courageous woman, you've found your true soul mate. \r\nBut now, it seems, just as fate has pulled you apart, testing your hearts in \r\npast lives, so it has brought you back together to test them again. ",
        "Eve: Chief, what are you saying? ",
        "Chief: I've had a vision. ",
        "Eve: A vision? ",
        "Chief: Your happiness will once more be threatened upon your arrival to Port \r\nCharles. ",
        "Ian: Threatened how? ",
        "Chief: I can only tell you that you'll have a decision to make. And should you \r\nmake the wrong decision -- ",
        "Eve: Wait a minute. What are you saying, chief -- that -- that we won't be \r\ntogether? ",
        "Chief: Not in this life. Not in any. ",
        "Ian: Chief, I -- I appreciate your concern, but after everything we've been \r\nthrough, everything we've experienced, there is nothing going to tear us apart.\r\n",
