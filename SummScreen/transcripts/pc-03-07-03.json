        "Elizabeth is convinced that Alison and Rafe are up to something, and she wants to be included. She insists that Caleb no longer has any power over her, but they don't believe that's possible. Rafe asks her to listen to the first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" and tell them what happens. As she listens, a change comes over her face, but she removes the headphones and claims to have felt nothing. She rushes out on the pretense of having a previous engagement, unaware that Alison and Rafe are following her. Alison realizes that her mother still loves the vampire who sired her. Caleb sleeps on the couch while Tess lies awake in his bed. After a nightmare about the night he became a vampire, he wakes up with a jolt and sees Tess looking at him with concern. Tess believes that Caleb longs to be the man he used to be, before he was turned into a vampire against his will. Now believing that they were meant to be together, she asks him to make love to her. Elizabeth lets herself into Caleb's loft and is stunned to see her husband making love to Tess. Meanwhile, Lucy blames Kevin for making her claustophobia worse. Kevin demands to know where they are and what they're looking for, but his questions go unanswered. When Lucy panics and says that she can't breathe, Kevin's suggestion to whistle calms her down. As they crawl through the cave, they see a light. It becomes much brighter as they approach it, and they hear the sound of running water. Ian breaks through into a cavern. The hot spring lies in the middle. To Ian, it feels as if there are answers there, but Lucy has a very different feeling, as if something is a little bit off. The cavern fills with the sound of moaning, and something odd is happening in the water. Lucy can't explain what's happening, but she doesn't think they're alone."

        "Elizabeth: I want to help",
        "Rafe: With what?",
        "Elizabeth: To get Caleb. I want to help you. I mean, I know -- I know that you don't trust me, but listen to me, Alison, I am begging you, if you have found something out about Caleb, a way to free me or help the others, I really want to be part of it. I mean, please just tell me that I can work with you.",

        "Lucy: He locked us in. We're locked in.",
        "Ian: Yeah, it's locked.",
        "Lucy: Oh. I really thought for a minute going to blow the whistle on us.",
        "Kevin: And miss out on all this fun? Skulking around in here with you and your boyfriend?",
        "Ian: Why don't you get a life for yourself?",
        "Kevin: You know, funny thing, Ian. I had a life until you came along and decided yet again that I had a wife that you couldn't stay away from.",
        "Lucy: Could you just stop it? Please just stop it!",
        "Kevin: You're getting claustrophobic, aren't you?",
        "Lucy: You know I hate small spaces like this, especially in this particular situation.",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe the universe is speaking to you, Lucy, because we're stuck in here.",
        "Ian: Come on, open up.",
        "Kevin: You know, it's pretty obvious that he locked us in from the outside. We're stuck.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Ian: It's ok. We'll find a way out. We will.",
        "Kevin: Great. You work on that, will you? In the meantime, Lucy -- Lucy, explain a couple of things to me, such as, A, what is this godforsaken place and, B, what are we supposed to be looking for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I want to thank you again, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: For what?",
        "Tess: For letting me stay here, for the clothes, for everything.",
        "Caleb: You don't have to thank me for anything. Here. Hop in.",
        "Caleb: Just -- I don't want you to worry about anything. Just feel safe and secure and make this your home.",
        "Tess: Where are you going to sleep?",
        "Caleb: I'll be on the couch.",
        "Tess: That doesn't sound very comfortable.",
        "Caleb: It'll be fine.",
        "Tess: All right. Then, good night.",
        "Caleb: Good night, Tess.",

        "Caleb: You, too, Tess. You, too",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What makes you think that we're doing anything to bring down Caleb?",
        "Elizabeth: Call it mother's intuition. Come on, I'm the mother. I have intuition.",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine. But let's be real here for a second. You haven't exactly shown a lot of willpower when it comes to Caleb.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, that was in the past. I'm free of him now. He doesn't have that kind of power over me anymore.",
        "Alison: What do you mean, he doesn't have that kind of power over you? He turned you into a vampire. Of course he does.",
        "Elizabeth: Hey, don't remind me every five minutes, all right?",
        "Alison: Oh, my --",
        "Rafe: Hey, wait a second. There might be something you can help out with. Can you excuse us for a second?",
        "Alison: Rafe, what -- you're not actually seriously thinking about letting her in on this, are you?",
        "Rafe: Just trust me on this one, ok?",
        "Joshua's voice: You want the brutal truth? He never loved you. He had many lovers before you, during you, and after you.",
        "Elizabeth's voice: Just never mind. I really don't care, anyway.",
        "Joshua's voice: Of course you do. Especially with what I am going to propose to you, give you the chance to get even with Mr. Caleb Morley, or should I say the artist previously known as Stephen Clay.",
        "Elizabeth's voice: How?",
        "Joshua's voice: I hear your lovely daughter, Alison, and the slayer Rafe and their little gaggle of tedious friends are planning to attack Stephen.",
        "Elizabeth's voice: All I have to do --",
        "Joshua's voice: Is to watch Alison and Rafe and their merry little band and find out what they're up to. And I prom-- I guarantee a revenge that will be satisfyingly full on Caleb Morley.",
        "Elizabeth's voice: Every time I think I hit rock bottom, I just slide a little further, and there you are.",
        "Joshua's voice: Can't you focus on trying to get rid of Caleb and stop obsessing on your pathetic love life?",
        "Elizabeth's voice: I deserve someone who loves me.",
        "Joshua's voice: Why don't you listen to me, and you'll have the chance to get back some of your pride. That way you won't end up as eternity's prettiest doormat.",
        "Elelizabeth: So?",
        "Rafe: So, I would like you to listen to a little song for me.",
        "Elizabeth: A song?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Well, actually, it's just five notes.",
        "Elizabeth: What does it have to do with me helping you destroy Caleb?",
        "Rafe: It could be nothing. It could be everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess' voice: You can do this, Stephen. Just try and connect to that place, that place inside deep down in your heart and your soul that's longing to live a normal human existence.",
        "Caleb's voice: I hate who you are! I will never be who you are! Don't you understand? I don't want to be you!",
        "Caleb's father: I never want to see you again!",
        "Caleb's voice: She met me. He sent her. He knew I trusted her. He had turned her. She was my stepmother, father's new wife, did his bidding.",
        "Tess' voice: All you have to do is reach inside yourself and find him again, that young man who was turned against his will. This is why you created me -- to be loved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: There's got to be another way out, some other opening or something. Come on, take a look.",
        "Kevin: You still haven't answered my questions. Such as, what is this place and what do you know about it?",
        "Ian: I don't know anything about it.",
        "Kevin: Oh, really? You know, I did see the map that I helped you finish. It means that you obviously had a reason to come down here in the first place.",
        "Ian: Let's get something straight. The three of us are not a team. We'll never be a team. If that's why you're here --",
        "Kevin: I'm here for the same reason you are -- to get Caleb.",
        "Lucy: Stop, stop, both of you. Just stop it. Ok, just please stop it. I cannot take it. I can't.",
        "Kevin: What's wrong, Lucy?",
        "Ian: You ok?",
        "Lucy: No, no, it's a little-known fact that when I get in small spaces like this, I'm a little panicky.",
        "Ian: What can I do?",
        "Lucy: Get me out of here. We're locked in. We're not getting out.",
        "Ian: No, I'll find a way.",
        "Lucy: No, I've got to get out of here. We can't get out because the door's locked, and I can't go that way, and I can't breathe. There's no air, so now I can't breathe.",
        "Kevin: Lucy, give me this, give me this. Look at me.",
        "Lucy: I can't catch my breath --",
        "Kevin: Lucy, look at me.",
        "Lucy: No.",

        "Ian: Watch yourself.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God.",
        "Ian: What is it? Is it coming back?",
        "Lucy: No. No, I'm ok. Look. There's a -- there's a light. Look. Over there. See it?",
        "Ian: I see it.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I see it, too.",
        "Lucy: Ok, then. Ok. Let's go, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Wait. I don't -- are you sure about this? We just told Ian and Lucy that we were going to help them find the spring.",
        "Rafe: And we will, ok? This will just take a second.",
        "Alison: What do you think my mother can help us with? I don't understand.",
        "Rafe: As you pointed out, she is a vampire.",
        "Alison: So?",
        "Rafe: So I'd like to know what, if anything, these five notes of Caleb's song do to her.",
        "Alison: You're going to let her listen to the notes?",
        "Rafe: I just need to know if Ian's reaction to this was a fluke, you know, if all vampires have the same reaction to these notes.",
        "Alison: But you're not going to tell her what Ian saw?",
        "Rafe: No, no, listen, I'm just going to give her the information she needs to know. She won't get sususpicious, promise.",
        "Alison: Ok, ok, ok.",
        "Rafe: All right.",
        "Elizabeth: All right. So, are you going to tell me what this is about?",
        "Rafe: Well, here's the thing. I've been listening to Caleb's music a lot lately, especially \"Naked Eyes.\"",
        "Elizabeth: Mm-hmm, yeah.",
        "Rafe: And, well, I've always had sort of an adverse reaction to it. You know, very hostile. Especially now. These five notes -- when I listen to them -- the thing is when Alison listens to them --",
        "Alison: Yeah, it's really good. It's a good feeling.",
        "Rafe: So I just want to see, you know, what affect they have on you.",
        "Elizabeth: You mean, on a vampire?",
        "Rafe: Exactly.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: What's wrong?",
        "Rafe: Did you see anything? Feel anything?",
        "Elizabeth: No. No, nothing unusual.",
        "Alison: You don't see anything?",
        "Elizabeth: No, the only thing is I completely forgot that I'm late for some dinner plans that I had for tonight.",
        "Rafe: Dinner plans.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, I have plans with an old friend.",
        "Alison: Mother, you don't have any old friends.",
        "Elizabeth: I -- do you mind if we do this again later?",
        "Alison: Well, I mean -- no.",
        "Elizabeth: Because I really have to hurry. I could probably still make it, all right?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Elizabeth: All right. See you.",
        "Alison: She did see something, didn't she?",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh.",
        "Alison: Well, do you think it was the same thing that Ian saw?",
        "Rafe: Only one way to find out.",
        "Alison: We follow her.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I think I know who her old friend is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Tess, you all right? Do you need something?",
        "Tess: Oh, I was worried. It sounded like you were having a bad dream or something.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I was, actually.",
        "Tess: I get nightmares sometimes, too.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, they're nothing to worry about.",
        "Tess: You know, sometimes, it helps maybe if you talk about it. What was the dream about? You can tell me, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: I -- I was dreaming about the night I was -- I was dreaming about the night I was turned into what a am.",
        "Tess: A vampire.",
        "Caleb: It's strange, you know. I haven't -- I haven't thought about that night in years, and then I meet you, and somehow it's haunting me now.",
        "Tess: No. It's touching, not haunting.",
        "Caleb: What does that mean?",
        "Tess: Touching. Don't you see? You want to be that man again. You want to feel the goodness and the love that you felt then, before it was all taken away. I want to feel that, too. Caleb, I want to be loved by that man.",
        "Caleb: You want me, too?",
        "Tess: Not the way you loved Livvie and not the way you loved since you were turned. I want to be loved by the man that turned his back on evil all those years ago, who left his home and his family in search of a better life. I want the best part of you to make love to the best part of me.",
        "Caleb: Tess --",
        "Tess: I believe you now. I was brought here to save you and to love you. And you were brought back to love me. It was what was meant for us all along.",
        "Caleb: I do. I want to be the man I once was, to love you as only he could.",

        "[Water runs]",
        "Ian: Do you hear that?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, sounds like running water.",
        "Ian: So it's not just in my head.",
        "Lucy: No. We are getting through. Keep going. It's a little bit brighter. Keep going. Oh. Oh, it's so bright, it hurts my eyes after all this darkness. What is that?",

        "Rafe: No, Caleb doesn't have a hold over you at all, Elizabeth.",
        "Alison: You know, I don't know why, but there's always this little piece of my heart that hangs on to hope that eventually my mother will change.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry, Alison, but as long as your mother's a vampire and Caleb's her master, as long as he's alive, she will serve him.",
        "Alison: Well, it's more than that.",
        "Rafe: What do you mean?",

        "Kevin: How can this be here? How can this be underground, right in the middle of Port -- you knew. You knew about this place. This is what you were looking for, right? From the map? The map that I drew from the music? What is this place? Where the hell are we?",
