        "Alison: Uh, Jack? ",
        "Jack: Yeah? ",
        "Alison: Can you hand me that dustpan over there? ",
        "Jack: Sure. ",
        "Jack: Here you are. ",
        "Alison: Thanks. It's ok. ",
        "Jamal: Yo, can somebody give me a hand with this over here, please? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, you might want to help him because, you know, I might kind of \r\nspaz out and he'd be pushed out the door. ",
        "Jack: Right, right. What's the problem? ",
        "Jamal: This ladder is tripping. Could you just hold it steady while I -- ",
        "Jack: Yeah, no problem. ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, this is your department. What color should this be? ",
        "Alison: Jack, could you please tell Jamal that I wouldn't possibly have a \r\nclue as to what color to paint that, seeing as though I'm not really even \r\nallowed to have an opinion about my own nana? ",
        "Jamal: You know what? You want me to stop treating you like a kid? Why don't \r\nyou stop acting like one?",
        "",
        "Frank: Come on. You send me a bunch of your messages and then you won't \r\nanswer one simple question? Who the heck are you? \"I got your other messages \r\nabout being lonely and just now how you've never felt like this before. Did you \r\nmean to write those to me?\" ",
        "Frank: \"I can't believe you can talk. What kind of machine are you?\" \"I'm not \r\na computer. I'm a person.\" ",

        "Eve: Uh -- I'm sorry to disturb you. ",
        "Ian: Oh, you didn't. ",
        "Arianna: Why are you here? ",
        "Eve: Well, uh -- this envelope came to the hospital for you, Ian. It looked \r\nimportant. I thought maybe lab results, and then I noticed that there was a new \r\naddress here, and -- on the label, so I thought maybe this might get overlooked, \r\nso I brought it here myself. Wow, this place looks amazing. You did a great job. \r\nHere you go. ",
        "Ian: Thanks. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Arianna: I thought you left town. ",
        "Eve: I did. I'm back. ",
        "Arianna: For a visit? ",
        "Eve: No, for good. ",

        "Karen: Hello. ",
        "Frank: Hey, congratulate me. I'm a genius. I finally got the e-mail working.\r\n",
        "Karen: Talk about a dog with a bone. ",
        "Frank: Hey, I like a challenge. Besides, I finally got the best of old Nellie \r\nBelle here. But I did connect to someone through this e-mail system. ",
        "Karen: You're a lonely man, Scanlon. ",
        "Frank: Right. You better get home quick. But it's really strange, Karen. \r\nSometimes messages will appear on the screen all by themselves. Other times, \r\nI'll type something and get an answer, but the messages are kind of weird. ",
        "Karen: Gee, thanks, since you thought one was from me. What exactly did the \r\nmessage say? ",
        "Frank: It said, \"I'm so in love.\" ",
        "Karen: You thought I sent that? ",
        "",
        "Alison: Jack, could you please tell Mr. Boyfriend-knows-best that we have a \r\nlot to do before the grand opening and it's not going to get done if we fight?\r\n",
        "Jamal: You are always bugging about talking things out, and now you're giving \r\nme the silent treatment. ",
        "Alison: I don't think that I sound silent. Do you think that I sound silent?\r\n",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah, yeah, you're talking through Jack. That's even better. ",
        "Jack: You know what? ",
        "Jamal: Come on. ",
        "Jack: I'll just be right over here. ",
        "Alison: Ok, fine. Let's talk, huh? Well, that was enlightening. Thanks, \r\nJamal. Thanks for sharing. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? You are so damn stubborn, you know that? No wonder why \r\nyou and your grandma don't get along. ",
        "Alison: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Excuse me -- now all of a sudden it's my \r\nfault? ",
        "Jamal: No, no, I'm just saying you should give her a chance. ",
        "Alison: Excuse me, Mr. Short-term Memory -- are you forgetting what she did \r\nlast summer? ",
        "Jamal: No, I'm not forgetting it or forgiving it. ",
        "Alison: Well, you could've fooled me. ",
        "Jamal: Look, your grandma, she loves you. Ok, she may have some messed-up \r\nways of showing it -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and if I let my guard down, she'll probably just work us again.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Look, would you just listen a second? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: Look, she knows she can't mess with you. Ok? And I think she misses \r\nyou too much to even try. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, if you think that she learned something from last summer, then \r\nyou don't know her. ",
        "Jamal: No, I don't know her, ok? But I know she's your only family you got \r\nright now, and that's something. Look, Jack and I, we can't bring back our moms. \r\nBut you can fix this thing with your grandma. Ok? You still have a chance. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, like a snowball's chance in hell. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? Just talking to you is just crazy. ",
        "Jack: You know what? You both are crazy. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I don't understand. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Arianna: I guess I'm just surprised you came back. ",
        "Eve: Well, this is -- this is my home. This is where I -- ",
        "Ian: You needn't worry about anything. ",
        "Arianna: How can you say that? You know the INS is watching us. ",
        "Ian: Eve and I are colleagues. They're not going to be upset about us talking \r\nto each other or working together in the hospital. ",
        "Arianna: You don't seem very surprised that Eve is back. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'm not. I knew she was here. ",
        "Arianna: And you didn't tell me? ",
        "Ian: No, I didn't tell you. I didn't think it was important. ",
        "Eve: Look, Arianna, I'm not here to get in the way, so you don't have to \r\nworry about me. ",
        "Arianna: The INS doesn't believe us as it is. I could tell by the way the \r\nagent looked at me when you were gone. ",
        "Eve: Well, Agent Lassen is just -- she's got that vibe, you know? I mean, \r\nshe's just doing her job. ",
        "Ian: That's right. And the INS is going to believe what we want them to \r\nbelieve. We've got it under control. ",
        "Arianna: You saw her, didn't you? The INS like -- she came -- that's how you know!\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah, Marika stopped by the basement apartment. ",
        "Arianna: When? ",
        "Ian: Earlier today. ",
        "Arianna: And you didn't tell me? Ian, this is my life! ",
        "Ian: I didn't want to upset you for no reason. ",
        "Arianna: No reason? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I took care of it. ",
        "Arianna: But Eve was there? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, she was there. What's the difference? ",
        "Eve: No, Ian -- he really did. He took care of everything. You should've \r\nheard the way he talked about you -- how much he missed you and how much he \r\ncouldn't wait to get back to his bride. ",
        "Ian: I promised I'd take care of you, and I meant that. All right? ",
        "Arianna: I still don't understand. ",
        "Ian: What? You don't understand what? ",
        "Arianna: If you smoothed things over with the INS then why take another \r\nchance? Why come by here? ",
        "Eve: Because I thought -- I thought that that envelope was important. ",
        "Arianna: You could've left it to be delivered. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Ian: Oh, that's me. Ahem. Thornhart. Oh, hey. Thanks for calling me back. \r\nYeah, one second. I got to take this. I'll be right back. Hey -- ",
        "Eve: I -- I'm going to go. I'm really sorry, Arianna. ",
        "Arianna: No, Eve, wait. Tell me the truth. Did you come back here to be with \r\nIan? ",
        "",
        "Karen: You think I have nothing better to do than send you love notes? Oh, \r\ntalk about conceited. ",
        "Frank: It's not conceited. I'm a great guy. It's called honesty. ",
        "[Karen chuckles] ",
        "Karen: Keep dreaming. ",
        "Frank: Well, you know, I thought you were playing a joke on me. ",
        "Karen: Ok, out with it. I want to hear every message, and don't leave out a \r\nperiod. ",
        "Frank: Well, the first message said, \"I feel so alone.\" Tonight it was, \r\n\"I'm so in love,\" followed by, \"I've never felt this way before.\" And finally, \r\n\"I can't believe you can talk. What kind of machine are you?\" And then \r\ncommunication stopped. ",
        "Karen: Ok, did you join one of those chat groups -- you know, for guys that \r\nspend too much time in their garages? ",
        "Frank: I told you it was weird. Someone's playing a joke on me, right? ",
        "Karen: Well, there's another possibility. Maybe you have a secret admirer. \r\nSounds like someone has a major crush on you. ",
        "",
        "Alison: What got into you? ",
        "Jack: Well, standing over there listening to the two of you for the past 10 \r\nminutes. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, because it's obvious, right? I mean, she shouldn't dump her \r\ngrandmother. ",
        "Jack: No, I didn't say that. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. Because he knows that I'm right to bag her. ",
        "Jack: No, I didn't say that, either. ",
        "Alison: But you do agree with me, though, right? ",
        "Jack: Do you guys know how lucky you are? Do you have any idea? ",
        "Alison: Well, yes, but I -- ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no. The two of you went through hell in order to be \r\ntogether, and you made it. And now you have this -- this great relationship. And \r\nto top it all off, you're -- you're starting your own shop, your own business. \r\nAnd you guys don't even realize it, but you're living a dream. Do you know how \r\nawesome that is? The two of you love each other, right? ",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Of course. Yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Then forget about the other stuff. Don't waste your time worrying \r\nabout it. Believe me, I know what it's like to fight over family things. \r\nAnd it's not worth it. But what you guys have is. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Well, thanks. Thanks for calling me back, Victor, and I -- I've got a \r\nfavor to ask you -- a big favor. I have someone who's in trouble. She needs some \r\nhelp. I need to find a new identity for her and a safe place to live. No, not \r\nPort Charles. I think she'd be much safer someplace else. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I came back because this is where I live. I have a job here, friends, a \r\nlife. ",
        "Arianna: One you hope will include Ian? ",
        "Eve: Ian is married to you, and I know that he will do whatever it takes to \r\nkeep you safe. ",
        "Arianna: But some things he cannot help. God, and things were going so well.\r\n",
        "Eve: Look, Arianna, I am not trying to ruin this for you. ",
        "Arianna: Do you mean that? ",
        "Eve: Yes. ",
        "Arianna: Then why -- ",
        "Eve: I'm on your side. ",
        "Arianna: Then why make things more difficult? ",
        "Eve: I'm not trying to do that. ",
        "Arianna: But it's what happens -- yeah, whenever you're around. And, Eve, \r\nlast time I saw you, you were kissing my husband. Now the INS saw you together.\r\n",
        "Eve: I know. But Ian really did take care of that. And it will never happen \r\nagain. ",
        "Arianna: Why should I believe you? ",
        "Eve: Look, trust is something that takes time. And I hope that in time you \r\nwill come to trust me. I saw the kind of fear you're living with. I saw it up \r\nclose in your brother. Believe me, I don't want anything to happen to you. ",
        "Arianna: I know. ",
        "Eve: I just -- I just want to help. Not that you need any help. I mean, you \r\nknow, you're doing a pretty good job making this look real all by yourself, you \r\nknow?",
        "Arianna: What do you mean?",
        "Eve: I mean making this marriage look real. Look at this place. It's so cozy \r\nand amazing. You did an amazing job. Everything that Ian loves is here. His -- \r\nhis history books. And the -- the black-and-white photos of children. Even -- \r\neven his Irish whiskey. You know how much Ian loves his Irish whiskey. \r\nEverything is beautiful and simple. Not fancy. Just like Ian. ",
        "Arianna: Stop it. Just -- just stop it! Ok, I know you're only trying to \r\nhelp, but don't you see? Every time you talk about Ian, you can't hide how you \r\nfeel. No one can know that. If you really want to help us, then just stay away \r\nfrom us! Just leave us alone! ",
        "",
        "Frank: So, who would have a crush on me? Besides you, of course. ",
        "Karen: Oh, get over yourself. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying \r\nto make me jealous so I come rushing home. ",
        "Frank: Rushing home sounds good. But that would kind of defeat the purpose of \r\nyou being in Tennessee. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, a little bit. Look, I'm up to my eyeballs in work, and this \r\ncourse means a lot to me, ok? ",
        "Frank: Well, can't blame a guy for trying. Well, I am going to rejoin the \r\nreal world. Enough of this computer and strange cyber messages. ",
        "Karen: Oh, and, Frank? If anyone proposes, remember -- ask to meet the family \r\nfirst. ",
        "Frank: Very funny. ",
        "[Karen laughs] ",
        "Frank: So, I'll see you when I see you. ",
        "Karen: I hope soon. ",
        "Frank: I really do miss you, but don't let that go to your head. ",
        "Karen: Too late. Bye, Frank. ",
        "Frank: Bye. Thanks for nothing. You really screwed me up big time. Karen's \r\ngoing to think I'm in here inhaling fumes. ",

        "Jack: All right, guys. What's it going to be? Because you know I'm right. ",

        "Man: And you're not going to be, either. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, right. Who do you think you are? ",
        "Man: Building inspector. Are you Jamal Woods? ",
        "Jamal: Jamal. ",
        "Man: Yeah, yeah -- Jamal. Uh -- then this is for you. ",
        "Alison: Well, what is it? ",
        "Man: It's a list of violations. ",
        "Jamal: A what? ",
        "Alison: Well, there could be, like, 50 things on here. ",
        "Man: Yeah, 52. And if each and every one of these problems isn't fixed up in \r\n48 hours, you're going to have to be closed down. ",
        "Jamal: 48 hours? There's no way we can get this done in two days. ",
        "Man: Then you're out of business. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: How could this happen? ",
        "Alison: I'll tell you. I'll tell you exactly how this happened -- Nana. I \r\ntold you -- this is what her love does. ",

        "Ian: What's going on here? ",
        "Eve: It -- it's my fault. ",
        "Arianna: No, Eve was only trying to help. I shouldn't have gotten upset. I'm \r\nsorry. ",
        "Eve: You don't have to apologize. It was me. ",
        "Arianna: No, it was wrong of me, and I -- I guess I'm just still tense. But \r\nit's no -- I have to go get dressed. ",
        "Eve: Arianna, wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. Why did you, really? ",

        "Ian: Hmm. So you thought you'd check up on me? ",
        "Eve: No! That's not what I was doing. I just -- I don't know! I wasn't \r\nthinking! And then I show up here and this place is all cozy and looks cute, and \r\nthe two of you are half-undressed and I know I'm -- ",
        "Ian: You're being ridiculous. ",
        "Eve: Ridiculous. Hey, I was going to say that. ",

        "Eve: I just keep thinking about -- about the warning that the chief gave us \r\nabout what would happen if we came back to Port Charles. ",

        "Eve: It was a lot more than a little misunderstanding. ",

        "Eve: Something became very clear to me tonight. ",
        "Ian: What's that? ",
        "Eve: I think Arianna is an amazing woman in a horrifying situation. And I \r\nknow that she's vulnerable and afraid. But there's more to that fear than the \r\nthreat she's facing. I could hear it in her voice. ",
        "Ian: What could you hear? ",
        "Eve: She's afraid of losing something very important to her, someone very \r\nimportant to her. I think Arianna's fallen in love with you. ",
