        "Alison: How could Nana do this to us? ",
        "Jamal: Come on, Ali, you don't know for sure it was her. ",
        "Alison: Well, who else would want to shut us down right before we open? ",
        "Jack: Hey, let me see that. What, are you kidding? Oh, most of these \r\nviolations are crazy. It won't take that long to fix. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, some will. ",
        "Jack: All right, then we'd better get started then. Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: I don't know how he thinks we're going to finish all this in 48 hours.\r\n",
        "Alison: Well, we have to, Jamal. We have worked too hard and I'm not giving \r\nup. ",
        "Jamal: Oh boy. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Mm. Hi. ",
        "Kevin: Hi. I am so sorry about dinner. ",
        "Lucy: Mm, is it -- is it really that late? ",
        "Kevin: Would you accept a peace offering? ",
        "Lucy: They're beautiful. ",
        "Kevin: So are you. ",
        "Lucy: I always did like your apologies. Doc, what is it? What happened to \r\nyour hand? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Arianna is in love with you, Ian. ",
        "Ian: No, she's not. She's afraid that Immigration's going to find out that \r\nthis marriage isn't real, that they're going to deport her back to her own \r\ncountry where her own family's going to kill her. ",
        "Eve: Well, it may have started out that way, but it's much more than that \r\nnow. ",
        "Ian: Do you think maybe you're overreacting a little bit? ",
        "Eve: I -- I've seen the way she looks at you. It's the same way I look at \r\nyou. She's not just afraid of the INS. She's afraid of losing the man she loves.\r\n",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ali, this isn't going to happen. ",
        "Jack: Ow. ",
        "Alison: Just don't talk, ok, just work. ",
        "Jamal: How we going to rewire the whole place in 48 hours, huh? And that's \r\njust the electrical. I mean, we're not talking about the plumbing, the \r\ninsulation -- ",
        "Alison: Look, stop being so negative, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm just being realistic. ",
        "Alison: Look, we cannot let Nana win. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we won't. We'll find a new place. ",
        "Alison: Where, Jamal? Where? Where are we going to find somebody who's going \r\nto back us, right, and give us a place rent-free with no startup costs and who's \r\ngoing to split the profits with us 50/50? Nowhere, that's where. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, now who's being negative? ",
        "Alison: Look, you want to be realistic? I'll be realistic with you. If we \r\ndon't get this shop off the ground, then we're going to be right back to where \r\nwe started, with nothing, and that's exactly where Nana wants us. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, we lost a round, ok? We didn't lose the whole fight. ",
        "Alison: Well, if a fight is what she wants, then a fight is what she's going \r\nto get. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on, what are you talking about? ",
        "Alison: I'm going to the press and I'm going to tell them that Nana knew all \r\nalong that it was me who killed Cedric. I warned her that if she interfered with \r\nour lives that this was going to happen. Just wait until I let them hear the \r\ntape of her and her little buddy Curtis. She wants to play dirty, I can play  dirty. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, you just leave it alone, ok? ",
        "Alison: No, I'm not going to let her walk all over us. Who knows what she'll \r\ndo next?",
        "Jamal: Well, it's not what she'll do next that I'm worried about. ",
        "Alison: Look, I am just trying to save this place. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you're not going to do anything. ",
        "Alison: Excuse me? ",
        "Jamal: You see the sign out there? It says \"Jamal's Bike Shop,\" ok? That's my \r\nname, it's my shop, it's my decision. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Just as I was leaving the hospital to meet you for dinner, the police \r\ncalled. ",
        "Lucy: And? And what happened? ",
        "Kevin: Well, this poor guy had gotten in way over his head. It's really no \r\nbig deal. ",
        "Lucy: It's no big deal? With this huge, bigger-than-average bandage on your \r\nhand that looks like it hurts, it's no big deal? I want to hear about the guy \r\nand what happened. ",
        "Kevin: Well, he got into a fight with his wife. Things got a little out of \r\nhand and -- well, when I got there, he was holding a gun on her. ",
        "Lucy: So this guy shot you? ",
        "Kevin: No. No, no, no, he didn't shoot anybody. I got through to him. It \r\nturns out the gun wasn't even loaded. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. So then how did your hand get hurt? ",
        "Kevin: Well, you see, his wife was pretty upset because he didn't go directly \r\nto jail. I had him admitted to the psych ward. ",
        "Lucy: So she shot you? ",
        "Kevin: No, no, she cut me. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Kevin: With a pair of scissors. ",
        "Lucy: With a pair of -- you could be killed with a pair of scissors. ",
        "Kevin: No, it's just a scratch. I didn't even need stitches. ",
        "Lucy: Are you -- are you absolutely sure? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, ER checked it out already. ",
        "Lucy: Really? ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, thank goodness. Just promise me you're never, ever going to \r\nget involved in anything like that again. ",
        "Kevin: Well, actually, I can't promise that. ",
        "Lucy: Why is that? ",
        "Kevin: I met the interim police commissioner tonight. He liked the way I \r\nhandled the situation, so we started talking and I told him about Mac's idea to \r\nstart up kind of a psychiatric swat team. ",
        "Lucy: So this police commissioner person wants you to go ahead with this? ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's like a joint effort between General Hospital and the Port \r\nCharles PD. ",
        "Lucy: Great. Ok, so sometimes, occasionally, from time to time, you might \r\npitch in and help out? ",
        "Kevin: Well, actually, he wants me to head up the team. ",
        "Lucy: Great. So let me -- let me just get this straight. You, instead of \r\nbeing in your nice, little, safe office in the hospital all fine and tidy, are \r\ngoing to be out on the street with cops and guns and bad guys and maybe \r\nscissors, where it's not so nice and very dangerous? ",
        "Kevin: I wouldn't put it like that. ",
        "Lucy: And I'm supposed to be ok with this? I just get you back and I'm \r\nsupposed to be ok with this? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Ok, Arianna is grateful to me maybe because I treated her better \r\nthan other men that she's known. It's only natural -- ",
        "Eve: That she'd fall in love with you. ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "Eve: Yes. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Eve: Can you just consider what I'm saying, just for a minute? ",
        "Ian: Ok, there is a possibility that she might be smitten by a ruggedly \r\nhandsome yet very sensitive man. It's not love. She's a young girl in a lot of \r\nways. ",
        "Eve: I know. But to a young girl who thinks she's in love, those feelings are \r\nso real. Ian, you are her hero. And I -- I'm the other woman. ",
        "Ian: Shh. No. There is no other woman. You are the only woman that I will \r\never love. ",
        "Eve: After everything we have been through together, I know that. But I can't \r\nhelp but think about what the chief was saying to us. I mean, this marriage has \r\nturned out to be a lot more trouble than we thought, right? ",
        "Ian: It's only temporary. ",
        "Eve: I know. I know, you're right, you're right. ",
        "Ian: Shh, shh, shh. That was Victor on the phone earlier and I asked him if \r\nhe could set up a new identity for her, find her a safe place to live. ",
        "Eve: And is he going to be able to help us? ",
        "Ian: He's already working on it. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: So we're going to be ok. It's going to be fine. Why can't you believe \r\nthat? ",
        "Eve: I can't help it. ",
        "Ian: Ok. We're going to settle this right now. ",
        "Eve: How? ",
        "Ian: We're going to sit down -- you, Arianna,  me -- going to sit down and \r\ndiscuss this right now. Arianna? Hey, can you come out here a minute? Arianna?\r\n",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: She's not there. ",
        "Eve: What? Where'd she go? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. Maybe she slipped out the back. I don't know. ",
        "Eve: My God, do you think she heard us? ",
        "Ian: I'm not sure, but she shouldn't be out there alone. Going to go find \r\nher. ",
        "Eve: Ok, I'm going to go with you. ",
        "Ian: No. You stay in here. I've got to do this alone. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Be careful. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Oh -- ",

        "Alison: So this is your bike shop? I thought that we were in this \r\ntogether. I thought that we were partners. Now it's all about you? ",
        "Jamal: Look, what I said was it's my name, it's my rep. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, only because I convinced somebody that you could do the work.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, I can. We can together if you don't screw things up, Ali.\r\n",
        "Alison: By letting Nana win? ",
        "Jamal: See, you're so caught up in this Nana thing and who beats who and all \r\nthis stuff. ",
        "Alison: So, what, you're just going to, like, give up, is that it? ",
        "Jamal: Did I say that? ",
        "Alison: Well, you're not exactly trying. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, because I'm not trying like you by going to the press. Ok, ok. ",
        "Alison: What, you got some better ideas? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. ",

        "Alison: Look, Jamal, I'm sorry, but I didn't start anything, ok? ",

        "Lucy: All right, but the unselfish part of me says go for it. Doc, this is \r\nwhat you're good at, this is what you're great at. I mean, I watched you talk \r\nthat poor woman down from the roof. She would've been dead right now, grieving \r\nfor her husband. And that guy with that hand grenade, just scared us all to \r\ndeath? We would've all been blown to smithereens if you weren't so good at what \r\nyou do. ",
