        "Karen: Eve? Hello? ",
        "Eve: What? What'd I miss? ",
        "Karen: Well, somebody is having a little trouble focusing today. ",
        "Eve: Hey, hey, I'm trying. I really am. I really am. ",
        "Karen: You and Ian must've had one heck of a night. ",
        "Eve: Oh, boy, did we. ",
        "Karen: You know, I still can't believe the two of you went back to that place \r\nwhere that madman kept you hostage -- Harris' compound? ",
        "Eve: You mean the place where we fell in love? ",
        "Karen: Hard to imagine. I saw the bunker. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but we fell in love all over again. Anyway, it's pretty \r\nincredible, isn't it? ",
        "Karen: Just like that? You walked in the door and, bam? ",
        "Eve: No, no, no, no. No, not just like that. I mean, we talked, you know, for \r\na long time. But then all of a sudden it was like all the pain and the anger -- \r\nit all just went away. It was like everything that has happened to us over the \r\nlast few months was just gone just like that, you know? ",
        "Karen: So what now, Dr. Love? ",
        "Eve: Happily ever after. All I know is that I am more in love now than I ever \r\nhave been. And I know from the bottom of my heart that nothing and no one \r\nwill ever come between Ian and me ever again. ",
        "",
        "Amy: Stay focused, Amy, on why I'm here. I promised my father. ",
        "Amy's Voice: I have to kill Ian. He killed my father. ",
        "Ed's Voice: The man who's shown you kindness, who opened your heart? ",
        "Amy's Voice: That's what you think. But I do not love Ian. ",
        "Ed's Voice: It's no crime to love someone. It's one of God's greatest gifts. \r\nAnd maybe that's the reason you came back -- to find out if love is possible for \r\neveryone. ",
        "Ian: Amy. ",
        "Amy: Ian. ",
        "Ian: Are you all right? Looked like you were miles away. ",
        "Amy: Oh, I'm fine. I -- I'm was just surprised, that's all. I'm trying to \r\nwork some things out. ",

        "Alison: My God. It's my name in the book. ",
        "Rafe: No. No, Alison, no, no, it can't be. It can't be, no. No, it can't be! \r\nYou have to live a long life, a wonderful life! Wait, wait, what are you doing? \r\nNo, no, this is the fifth chair, this is the fifth chair. Come on, come on, get \r\nup! Get up! You can do it! God, I don't want her to die! Come on, Alison, come \r\non, get out of there! Get out of there! I don't want you to die, please! No! \r\nNo! Alison, no. ",

        "Alison: Right here. What is it? ",
        "Rafe: Angel? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm right here. It was just a bad dream. ",
        "Rafe: It was just a dream, just a dream. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, no, it was a nightmare, but you're awake now. It's ok. Rafe?\r\n",

I'm doing my \r\nbest to -- no, sir, I am not taking it personally. I'm just -- you know how I am \r\nabout taking care of details. Even the tiniest details. Yes, sir. Everything's \r\nunder control, sir. Yes, sir, the fifth chair is ready. Well, no. Thank you, \r\nsir. Couple more days and one more soul will leave Port Charles. ",

        "Alison: Wow. Must have been some dream. ",
        "Rafe: Was it? Was it a dream? ",
        "Alison: Of course it was. What do you mean? Ow! What are you doing? Stop it.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Ok, maybe it was. May-- maybe it was just a dream. ",

        "Rafe: It's nothing. ",
        "Alison: What? No, it is something. I can tell by the look on your face. ",
        "Rafe: I was just afraid. ",
        "Alison: Of what? Tell me. Listen, you have to tell me because if you fall \r\nasleep again, you're going to dream the exact same thing -- ",
        "Rafe: No! No! ",

        "Rafe: Everything about everyone. ",
        "Alison: Even when someone's going to die. And you -- you read it in the \r\ndream? ",
        "Rafe: Well, no, I didn't -- ",
        "Alison: We were trying to find out who the fifth chair was, weren't we? ",
        "Rafe: We couldn't find it at first because we were nervous, you know, because \r\nwe weren't supposed to be there in the first place. ",
        "Alison: Ok, and what happened next? ",
        "Rafe: I got this really awful feeling in my stomach. ",
        "Alison: You were, like, afraid? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but it wasn't like anything I'd ever felt before, not when I was \r\nreally alive. Not ever before. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, ok, listen -- ",
        "Rafe: It was -- ",
        "Alison: Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It was just a dream, ok, and sometimes our \r\nworst fears and the scariest things that we can ever come up with or imagine \r\ncome out in them, but they don't really happen. ",
        "Rafe: You know what -- sometimes bad dreams do happen. ",
        "Alison: Hey, let it go. Ok? It'll fade away. ",
        "Rafe: You promise? ",
        "Alison: I cross my heart. ",
        "Rafe: You are so good to me. ",
        "Alison: Well, it is so easy. And it gets better. ",
        "Rafe: It does? ",
        "Alison: Yes. How about a cup of that really chocolaty hot chocolate that you \r\nlike so much? ",
        "Rafe: Hot chocolate? You're right. It just got absolutely better. ",
        "Alison: Exactly. And -- ugh -- I'm so hungry. I want breakfast. So I'm going \r\nto go get some, ok? ",

        "Amy: Well, my handler hasn't said much, but he made it pretty clear that it's \r\ngoing to be someplace very warm. ",
        "Ian: Can't be too bad. ",

        "Ian: I still just wish we could talk about, you know, the past, how you ended \r\nup in the Witness Protection Program in the first place. ",

        "Ian: Hmm. Ok. ",

        "Amy: Well, that must have been very hard. ",
        "Ian: Not really. See, life is too short to try to make something out of \r\nsomething that isn't. Just cut to the bone. You showed me how. ",

        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: You know? The fifth chair is not the thing that scares me the most. \r\nWhat scares me the most is not being able to spend every single second that I \r\nhave with you in your arms. ",

        "Alison: I don't know. Maybe it was from hanging around some tall, brilliant, \r\nsexy guy. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no. Ok, ok, you know what -- I'm almost human, basically, but I \r\ndefinitely don't have any powers and -- so you're right. It was a dream. It was \r\njust a dream. ",
