        "Paige: Lucy, what? ",
        "Lucy: Up. Up, up, up. Get up. ",
        "Paige: Where's Kevin? ",
        "Lucy: He -- let's see. Where did he go? He ran out of teal -- or was it that \r\nangel glow white color? So he had to go. Let's go. Come on. ",
        "Paige: Go where? I'm not leaving before Kevin's finished painting the \r\nportrait. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I don't really mean \"let's go,\" let's go. I mean let's really, \r\ntruly leave. ",
        "Paige: I can't be the only one who has difficulty understanding you. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, look. I just found out that you are an angel, right? ",
        "Paige: Yeah, so far. ",
        "Lucy: And supposedly you're on some sort of quest or journey or something \r\nthat you claim you don't understand. ",
        "Paige: \"Claim?\" ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. So as soon as we figure out why you're here, then I figure you're \r\ngoing to be gone. Which means instead of you sitting around just waiting for my \r\nhusband to finish your portrait and not caring what happens, I happen to really \r\ncare. So I want to figure this out. Let's get to work. ",
        "Paige: On what? ",
        "Lucy: Figuring out why you're here and where you need to go. ",
        "Paige: Lucy, you don't honestly think that those ridiculous cards can tell \r\nthe future. ",
        "Lucy: Paige, I do, so shut up and shuffle. ",

        "Casey: Jamal and Frank. ",
        "Jamal: Ricky -- ",
        "Frank: Ricky? ",
        "Casey: See, I told you -- he might have already split town by now. ",
        "Frank: In the condition you say he was in, Casey? ",
        "Casey: Fine. So he disappeared into thin air, ok, Frank? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, speaking of disappearing, where did you disappear to while \r\nwe were out searching the docks? ",
        "Casey: I had to hit the john. Is that all right with you, Daddy? ",
        "Frank: Look, look, he's not here. Let's grab a quick bite at the Recovery \r\nRoom and then head back out, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, that sounds like a plan to me. ",
        "Frank: All right. Let's roll. ",
        "Casey: That's cool. So I'll see you all later. ",
        "Jamal: What, you're not coming with us? ",
        "Casey: Man, actually, I'm kind of not feeling all that great, so -- ",
        "Jamal: Oh, all of a sudden? ",
        "Casey: Yeah, it happens. Look, I'm just going to chill and hang out, all \r\nright? I'll catch up. ",
        "Frank: Are you sure you're ok? ",
        "Casey: It's minor, all right? Just -- just -- you two keep looking for him, \r\nok? ",
        "Frank: Ok, if you say so. Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Uh-huh. Yeah. ",

        "Rafe: Right here. Got it all. ",
        "Alison: Ok, good. So we're just going to go in and enjoy a nice, quiet, calm, \r\n\"everything's fine, we're just going to enjoy every single last minute that we \r\nhave together\" romantic picnic. ",
        "Rafe: In our special place. ",
        "Alison: That's right, in our very special place where all of our good dreams \r\ncome true. I'm just trying to erase that terrible dream that you had about --\r\n",
        "Rafe: Angel, please, not another word about, you know -- ",

        "Alison: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ok? Listen to me. I'm very sorry. But I'm \r\nhappy. I'm healthy. Look at me. Everything's fine, ok? And I'm in love \r\nwith you. So let's go in and enjoy some of our time together. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. You're right. I know you're right. I mean, like I say, life is a \r\ngift and it's precious -- ",
        "Alison: That's right. ",
        "Rafe: And while things are going our way, we should just -- ",

        "Casey: Yeah. Me, too. Ok, look, Ricky, I'm not used to helping anybody, ok? \r\nThis is kind of new to me. I don't really know how to do this, so -- hey. Wow. \r\nOh, man, you are hot. Look, are you sure this is the right thing? Ricky, you \r\nsure this is the right thing, us staying down here? ",

        "Ricky: Yeah. Tell me the truth. ",
        "Casey: Ok. The truth? The truth is you have a fever, ok? And -- and the cuts \r\nand stuff on your face -- look, Ricky, you're burning up, ok? We got to do \r\nsomething! We can't just -- ",

        "Rafe: Ok, I said take it easy. ",
        "Boy: And I said to get lost, mister. You can go back to my parents and tell \r\nthem I'm not coming home and I'm not moving. ",
        "Girl: That goes for me, too. ",
        "Rafe: Kids, you need to calm down. ",
        "Boy: We're not kids. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no. Of course they're not. God, Rafe, they're almost teenagers. \r\nAnd they're armed -- or he's armed with a very dangerous pitchfork. ",
        "Rafe: Right. ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. You know what? Nobody sent us and we don't know your parents, so, \r\nyou know, put the fork down. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I mean, if you guys just sort of tell us what's wrong, then \r\nmaybe we could help you. ",

        "Girl: Uh-uh. No way. ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok, I understand. Ok, but, you know, you guys, there's lots of \r\nthings that you can do to stay connected even if you're not together. ",
        "Bernie: Yeah, that's what they say, too. ",
        "Girl: You just don't understand what it's like to have your best friend leave \r\nyou forever. ",

        "Paige: Lucy, you're out of your mind if you actually think that these -- ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, no, no, I don't just think. I know these cards can tell you \r\nwhat the universe has in store, what it has planned, even for someone who's \r\ncrossed over to the big side. ",
        "Paige: Yes, but I don't believe in these kind of -- ",
        "Lucy: Well, just -- would you just shuffle? I cannot believe this. I am \r\nsitting here talking to a dead person, and you say you can't believe in this?\n",
        "Paige: Well, I can believe in angels because I have evidence. I mean, I am \r\nevidence. But, I mean, to think turning over a silly card can tell the future --\r\n",
        "Lucy: It can -- the future, the past, and anything else that's in store for \r\nyou. Now, you just have to be very sensitive to the symbols on the cards, and I \r\nhappen to be very, very darn sensitive. So just please keep shuffling and focus.\r\n",
        "Paige: On what? ",
        "Lucy: Focus on what you're most desperate to know. I'll tell you what I'm \r\nmost desperate to know is why you're here. I'm sure you're anxious also. ",
        "Paige: Right. Well, it's obviously no use arguing. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Paige: There you are. Shuffled sufficiently. What's next? ",
        "Lucy: Ok -- well, you did that very nicely. ",
        "Paige: Hmm. ",

        "Lucy: Oh, my goodness. Look at it. Look. ",
        "Paige: And? ",
        "Lucy: It's the Angel card. It's staring right up at you. Don't you see? What \r\ndo you think? ",
        "Paige: Coincidence? ",

        "Lucy: Well, that's kind of a good question. I mean, my dumb cards came up \r\nwith the angel staring at us right away, right? But this I don't know. ",
        "Paige: It's a young girl. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. But the question is, what connection does she have to you and why \r\nyou're here? ",

        "Jamal: No, why don't you sit down? What do you mean about learn something \r\nfrom this? ",
        "Frank: Would you stop giving me a hard time when I'm trying to help? ",
        "Jamal: Look, well, your helping is ticking me off. Besides, Ricky is the one \r\nthat needs help, not me. ",
        "Frank: Ricky got cut by those guys in that back alley crap game, right? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. So what? ",
        "Frank: So you were there, too, Jamal. And from the size of that chip on your \r\nshoulder, you're lucky those guys didn't try to cut you up. ",
        "Jamal: Or maybe they're lucky that they didn't try. ",
        "Frank: Right. You would have driven them away with your attitude and your new \r\nand improved personality -- same thing you've been using to drive away most of \r\nyour friends. ",
        "Jamal: Well, maybe they weren't friends to begin with anyway. ",
        "Frank: So what are you going to do now, huh? Chase those guys down by \r\nyourself for some kind of payback? ",
        "Jamal: I know what I'm doing, Frank. I'm just doing what I got to do, just \r\nlike everybody else. ",

        "Paige: \"Ha-ha\" what? ",

        "Lucy: Well, you might be able to, Paige, if you would just open up your brain \r\nand try to focus here, ok? I'm going to do another one. Family. This is family. \r\nWait -- something about your family. ",
        "Paige: Well, that proves it, then. I mean, they're wrong or you're wrong \r\nbecause I don't have any family. I was the last one. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, no, no. That's not right at all. This is right. Paige, you're \r\nnot the last one. This is telling me that you do have a family and you're not \r\nthe last one of your line. ",

        "Alison: No, but it -- I mean, it helped me. It could. ",
        "Sara: How? ",
        "Rafe: Well, because she knows that whenever she thought of him, he would have \r\nher in his thoughts, too, and in his heart -- always. ",
