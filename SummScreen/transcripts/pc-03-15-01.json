        "Eve: All right. I'm ready. I would like a calzone, and please, make it hot \r\nthis time. ",
        "Lou: You doctors are so demanding. ",
        "Eve: That's right. Karen, you're back. ",
        "Karen: Hey! ",
        "Eve: Hey! It's so good to see you. ",
        "Karen: Well, I finished my course early, so I'm picking up pizza pie. I \r\nordered the large with everything. ",
        "Lou: Hey, I suppose you want that hot? ",
        "Karen: Uh -- yeah. ",
        "Lou: Ok. ",
        "Eve: A large? Did your appetite increase while you were in Memphis? ",
        "Karen: It's not just for me. I'm going to go surprise Frank. ",
        "Eve: So you just hit town and now you're going over to Frank's. ",
        "Karen: Uh, well, we kind of got close when I was away. ",
        "",
        "Frank: \"How are we communicating?\" \"Simple. We must be connected through the \r\ninternet.\" ",
        "Frank: Wait -- \"What's the internet?\" Oh. \"Where have you been? Mars?\" \"I \r\nlive in a small town.\" More like under a rock. \"Are you sitting at a machine \r\nlike me?\" Ok, all right. Now I know somebody is putting me on. \"Signing off. \r\nI've got to meet someone. Check your server. Our wires must be crossed.\" ",
        "Frank: \"Are you with the government?\" Right. And Elvis isn't really dead. \r\nThis is -- this is getting too weird. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Here. ",
        "Arianna: Thank you. ",
        "Ian: Your hands are shaking. ",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry. ",
        "Ian: Hey. You have nothing to apologize for. You were raped. It's a crime.\r\n",
        "Arianna: You can't understand what it's like for me. No man can. ",
        "Ian: I'd like to try. ",
        "Arianna: To have someone overpower you, strip you of your dignity, of your \r\nvery soul, it's something unspeakable. ",
        "Ian: Talk to me. Talk to me. Make me understand. I'm not like the other man.\r\n",
        "",
        "Karen: When I was in Tennessee, Frank and I talked on the phone almost every \r\nday. And pretty soon, I was waiting for his phone calls and I couldn't stop \r\nthinking about him. Does that sound real junior high? ",
        "Eve: Like, totally. But it is so good to see you happy. What happened? I \r\nmean, you went from, \"Yeah, Frank's a nice guy\" to \"Frank's really hot\" in a \r\nmatter of seconds. ",
        "Karen: I did kind of put on the brakes at first because of Frank's past. ",
        "Eve: Hmm. ",
        "Karen: I mean, he didn't exactly scream relationship material. But he's \r\nchanged so much, Eve. He's a different guy. ",
        "Eve: Well, he sounds like the kind of guy that really likes you. ",
        "Karen: And I was so ready to be liked. In fact, I trust him and I can't \r\nimagine him disappointing me or hurting me. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Man! I missed you so much. I missed our girl talk. ",
        "Karen: Well, you could've called. I was a phone call away. ",
        "Eve: Well, that would've been the smart thing to do. But I was so desperate. \r\nYou'll never guess whose shoulder I cried on. ",
        "Karen: Who? ",
        "Eve: Lucy. ",
        "Karen: Uh -- that's not desperation. That's insanity. You confiding in Lucy? \r\nWhat were you thinking? ",
        "Eve: I wasn't. I was just so mixed up. I mean, this is a time in my life when \r\nI should be the happiest, right? I mean, I -- I should be walking on air, I \r\nshould be singing in the rain, I should be whistling while I work. ",
        "Karen: I recognize those symptoms. You're in love. ",
        "Eve: I am so in love. ",
        "Karen: Well, why do I get the feeling there's a big \"but\" coming? ",
        "Eve: Arianna's fallen in love with Ian. And I'm afraid the longer she stays \r\nwith him, the harder it's going to be for her to let go. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I don't want to talk about what happened to me. ",
        "Ian: You can't keep it inside. ",
        "Arianna: It's -- it's so hard. ",
        "Ian: I would think that denying your feelings would be harder. ",
        "Arianna: I can't. ",
        "Ian: Ok. That's fine. I'm not going to push you. I'll wait till you're ready.\r\n",
        "Arianna: That night, I wanted to go to the library. Just down the street to \r\nthe library. ",
        "Arianna: It was already dark. My father forbade me to go. But I wanted a \r\nbook. That's all I wanted. A book. So I went out anyway. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. ",
        "Arianna: God, I didn't mean for -- look, I didn't know what would happen. I \r\nhad no idea. ",
        "Arianna: It was such a beautiful night. But I should have listened to my \r\nfather. He was trying to protect me. I shouldn't have gone out. ",
        "Ian: You did nothing wrong. You got to know that. You did nothing wrong. ",
        "Arianna: I should've come home, straight from the library. But it felt so \r\ngood to be out of the house, to feel free. So good. ",
        "Ian: So you went for a walk. ",
        "Arianna: I went down to the water. I loved the water. ",
        "Arianna: But the next thing I knew, he was there -- a friend of my brother's.\r\n",
        "Arianna: He promised not to tell my family that I'd disobeyed my father. So I \r\nthanked him. And then I tried to leave. Then he grabbed me. Tight. I could \r\nhardly breathe. And then, then he -- he started touching me. Then I asked him to \r\nstop -- stop -- but he wouldn't. I can still feel his hands on me now, his hot \r\nbreath on my neck, the way his eyes stared at me, through me. He forced me down, \r\ndown to the ground, and ripped off my blouse. ",
        "Arianna: My new white blouse. ",
        "Arianna: I begged him. I begged him to let me go. I begged him not to hurt \r\nme. ",
        "Arianna: But the more I fought, the stronger he seemed to get. And then I \r\ntried -- I tried -- ",
        "Ian: It's ok. You don't have to -- it's all right. ",
        "Arianna: No, I tried -- I tried to scream and I opened my mouth. I was \r\nscreaming out inside my head. But nothing came out. Nothing. ",
        "Ian: Well, you can scream now. ",
        "Arianna: I can't. ",
        "Ian: Oh, yes, you can. You scream at the bastard that brutalized you. You \r\nscream for what he did to you. Scream for what he took from you. You scream and \r\nyou keep screaming until you can't scream anymore. ",
        "Arianna: No! ",
        "Arianna: God, no! ",
        "Arianna: No -- ",
        "",
        "Karen: So does Ian know about his new bride's feelings for him? ",
        "Eve: Oh. Come on. You know men -- they're usually the last to know when a \r\nwoman's interested in them. ",
        "Karen: Well, there are no easy answers here. But at least my faith in Ian's \r\nrestored. I thought he was a jerk for marrying some stranger when it was clear \r\nto everyone that he was crazy about you. ",
        "Eve: I'm nuts about a guy who always does the right thing -- even if it's \r\nkeeping us apart for the moment. But that's why I love him. ",
        "Karen: Well, I can't say I'd be so cool if Frank married some other woman.\r\n",
        "Eve: You have nothing to worry about. It sounds like Frank is head over \r\nheels. ",
        "Karen: And the feeling's mutual. ",
        "Lou: Pizza with the works. ",
        "Karen: That's me. Will you be ok? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Just call me every five minutes, ok? I've got a lot of time on my \r\nhands. ",
        "Karen: Ok. I better get this pizza over to Frank while it's still hot. ",
        "Eve: And you are. ",
        "Karen: Ha. I'll call you. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Are you all right? ",
        "Arianna: Ok. Better. Thank you for listening. ",
        "Ian: Well, now I understand why you got so upset when that man approached you \r\ndown by the water. ",
        "Arianna: I -- I just got so scared. ",
        "Ian: You told me I could never understand what you went through -- the terror \r\nand how frightened you were, and you're right. I am ashamed that a man could do \r\nthat to a woman, that a man could hurt a woman in that way. And I'm ashamed that \r\nyour family abandoned you when you needed them most. ",
        "Arianna: In my country, it's always the woman's fault. ",
        "Ian: Listen to me. I don't care what your brother or your mother or your \r\nfather say. You're not to blame. ",
        "Arianna: I don't understand how a man could do something like that to me when \r\nI did nothing, nothing. ",
        "Ian: He's not a man. Women are to be cherished, honored, loved. Where would \r\nwe be without women -- huh? -- To balance us and sustain us, to bear our \r\nchildren? ",
        "Arianna: You feel like that about all women? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I do. ",
        "Ian: What's the matter? ",
        "Arianna: What you said was beautiful. ",
        "Ian: I meant it. ",
        "Arianna: Ian, could you -- ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Arianna: Hold me. ",
        "",
        "Woman: So I told my girlfriends no more blind dates. It's too scary, like \r\nbungee jumping. ",
        "Frank: Blind dates, just say no. ",
        "Woman: Ok, your turn. ",
        "Frank: What do you mean? ",
        "Woman: I know Neil's mom is out of the picture. Is there anyone else I should \r\nbe jealous of? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, there's someone, but sometimes I think she would be better off \r\nwithout me. ",
        "Woman: So, what is this girl that I'm getting jealous of like? ",
        "Frank: Hmm. Terrific, funny, smart. ",
        "Woman: I'm sorry I asked. I was hoping more for \"screwed up, controlling.\" \r\nAnd is \"plain\" too much to ask for? ",
        "Frank: She's beautiful, too. ",
        "Woman: Why did I know you were going to say that? ",
        "Frank: So, you know, maybe -- maybe this wasn't such a good idea, and maybe \r\nwe should call it a day. ",
        "Woman: We haven't even started. ",
        "Frank: What'd you have in mind? ",
        "Woman: Why don't you take me back to your place? ",
        "Frank: Oh, I -- I -- I don't know. ",
        "Woman: Come on. You were going to show me this computer you're always ranting \r\nabout. ",
        "Frank: Well, there really isn't much to see. ",
        "Woman: Come on. It'll be fun. Besides, if you're really trying to get this \r\ngirl off of your mind, this will be a good distraction. ",
        "Frank: Well, I guess. Why not? I've got no plans. ",
        "",
        "Karen: Well, Nellie, it's nice to see you, but no offense, I was kind of \r\nhoping to find Frank here waiting for my daily call. ",
        "Karen: Did you give him trouble, make him drive out there in search of some \r\nsleek, sexy little laptop? ",
        "Karen: Come on, Scanlon. Where are you? I hope you want to see me as much as \r\nI want to see you. ",
        "",
        "Chief's Voice: I can only tell you that you'll have a decision to make, and \r\nshould you make the wrong decision -- ",
        "Eve: What are you saying, chief, that -- that we won't be together? ",
        "Chief: Not in this life. ",
        "Ian: I appreciate your concern. But after everything we've been through, \r\neverything we've experienced, there is nothing going to tear us apart. ",
        "Eve: I believe it, Ian. I believe we will be together. I won't let anything \r\ncome between us. And I will wait for you for as long as it takes. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry. I haven't cried this much since I was a little girl. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. We can all do with a good cry once in a while. ",
        "Arianna: I tried to be so strong. ",
        "Ian: Hey. You are strong. Don't ever forget that. There's many women who \r\nwouldn't have survived this. ",
        "Arianna: I still have nightmares about what -- what still could happen to me.\r\n",
        "Ian: I'm going to make sure that you're safe. I will protect you for as long \r\nas you need me because one day, I want you to know what it's like to be adored \r\nand loved by a very lucky man. ",
        "Arianna: Do you really think that will happen? ",
        "Ian: I do. I do. So what do you say? Let's get out of here. ",
        "Arianna: I'd like that. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Do you need to talk to Kevin or some other doctor -- ",
        "Arianna: No. I feel better now. ",
        "Ian: Good. Let's take you home. ",
        "Arianna: That's where I'd really like to be -- our home. ",

        "Eve: I have had nothing to do around here but think about all the sexy things \r\nI'm going to do to you. ",
        "Jack: We make a good team. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we're only three people, though. ",
