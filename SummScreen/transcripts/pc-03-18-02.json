        "Rafe: My wife. God, I love the sound of that. ",
        "Alison: So do I. ",
        "Rafe: I wish this could go on forever. ",
        "Lucy: Aha. Ok. Ok, how about a Franklin Smith of Liverpool? ",
        "Paige: No. ",
        "Lucy: All right. Wait a minute. There's an Edna Smith or Charlie -- a Chucky \r\nSmith. ",
        "Paige: Lucy, come on, this is ridiculous! You are not going to find my \r\nrelatives on a genealogy website! ",
        "Lucy: You know what? I am because that's exactly how I found my relatives, \r\nthe Koviches. ",
        "Paige: Let me rephrase this -- you're not going to find any relatives \r\nalive. I've told you a hundred times -- I don't have any living family! ",
        "Lucy: Yes, you have. You've told ad nauseam. And I've told you the cards tell \r\nme that ain't so. ",
        "Paige: Why is this so important to you? ",
        "Lucy: For goodness' sake, I would think this would be obvious. If I do not \r\nfigure out why you're here and what journey you're on, then you are going to \r\nhaunt us for the rest of our lives! ",
        "Paige: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: What's going on? ",
        "",
        "Amy: Papa. I'm so glad you're here with me. I need you. ",
        "Harris: I tried to tell you, sweetheart. I tried to tell you that Ian \r\nThornhart is nothing but a cold, ruthless murderer. ",
        "Amy: How could I have been so stupid? He doesn't love me. He never did. He \r\njust used me, took from me. He took from me the only man that ever really loved \r\nme. ",
        "Harris: And I still love you. My darling, more than ever. Hey, you're still \r\nmy little girl. ",
        "Amy: Oh, Papa. I'm sorry. ",
        "Harris: Shh. You mustn't worry. There's still time. ",
        "Amy: Yes, there is. No one has figured out who I am. They have no idea that \r\nI'm your daughter. I can still do it, and I will, Papa. I'll make sure that Ian \r\nThornhart is dead on your birthday, just like I promised. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Go on. Open it. ",
        "Eve: A picture of Amy and some guy you think is her father -- what's the big \r\ndeal? ",
        "Chris: Well, I don't know. But I do know that she wanted to make damn sure \r\nthat nobody saw that picture. And it's my gut feeling that Mr. X -- he's the \r\nreason why. ",
        "Eve: I don't want to see this. ",
        "Chris: Well, sure, you do. ",
        "Eve: No, I don't. Ian and I are back. We're perfect. We're in love. ",
        "Chris: Oh, great. I'm thrilled. ",
        "Ian: There she is. I told you we'd find her. You owe me a dollar. ",
        "Eve: There's my buddy. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Eve: Hi. Pinch your little pink cheeks. ",
        "Ian: The dinner ended abruptly, so I got the kid and thought we'd find you, \r\nsee if you were ready to go home. ",
        "Eve: Yes, I'm certainly ready to go home. Are you ready? You've had a long \r\nday, haven't you? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: Yes, my buddy. You've had a long day. What do you think? Did you miss \r\nyour mommy? Did you miss your mommy? ",
        "Chris: Hey, you know what? I'll hold down the fort here if you want to get \r\nout. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Ok, thanks. Thanks a lot. Here. Take this. ",
        "Chris: Sure. ",
        "Eve: Sorry. I dropped that. ",
        "Chris: Hey, no problem. ",
        "Eve: Get it for me, will you? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: Bye. ",
        "Chris: Bye-bye. And don't bother thanking me. I think you'll be thanking me a \r\nlittle bit later. ",

        "Kevin: So, just what are you doing? ",
        "Lucy: Uh -- well, you know, it's really very simple, actually. The cards have \r\ntold me over and over and over again that Paige has some relative, some \r\nconnection here in Port Charles, and I figure for her to complete her journey, \r\nshe has to figure out what that connection is. So I am just simply trying -- ",
        "Kevin: Just trying to help. ",
        "Paige: Well, I'm impressed. I mean, I've been searching day and night for the \r\npast three months to try and figure out why I'm here. All Lucy has to do is flip \r\nover a few cards and -- presto -- she has the answer. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I do. And you know what? I don't care if you believe me or not \r\nbecause I believe enough for all of us. ",
        "Paige: What about you, Kevin? I mean, you don't honestly believe this \r\nnonsense, do you? Oh, God. Don't tell me -- ",
        "Kevin: Look, look, I honestly don't know what to believe. I mean, I'm having \r\na hard enough time looking at you knowing that you're -- ",
        "Paige: An angel. ",
        "Kevin: An angel, yes. ",
        "Paige: Yes, I know, which I'm not fully yet, at least, and I'm not going to \r\nbe if we don't stop looking at these silly cards! ",
        "Kevin: But what I have learned is not to underestimate my wife -- ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Even though she tends to go overboard once in a while. ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you need to back off just a little bit. Besides, we all agreed \r\nwhat was most important right now is finishing Paige's portrait. ",
        "Paige: Yes, and the sooner we finish it, the sooner we'll be able to take it \r\nhome where it belongs and hang it in the hall with the others. ",
        "Lucy: Home. Back to London. ",
        "Paige: Well, yes, of course. That's where all of the Smith portraits are \r\nhung. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, of course. It's really very simple, isn't it? Good. Paint. Doc, \r\nthat's -- that's what you need to do. You need to paint. Paint, paint, paint -- \r\nright now. Go ahead. ",
        "Kevin: What are you doing? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm going to sit right here and watch you paint, paint, paint. Go \r\nahead. ",
        "Kevin: No, you're not. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I am. ",
        "Kevin: No, you're not. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I am. ",
        "Kevin: No, you're not, Lucy, because I can't paint and play referee between \r\nyou two. If you want this thing to be finished, you have to leave us alone. ",
        "Lucy: Since when did you become Mr. Sensitive Artist? Ok. Ok, fine. I'll just \r\nbe moseying, then. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you for understanding. ",
        "Lucy: I do understand. You're welcome. But listen -- ",
        "Kevin: Hmm? ",
        "Lucy: Get busy. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Go. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. You have to forgive her. ",
        "Paige: Mm-hmm. Do I? ",
        "Kevin: Come on, give her a break. This has all been a little more than \r\namazing for all of us. ",
        "Paige: Yes, I know, but -- ",
        "Kevin: Like I said, Lucy's instincts are not something that I would just \r\ndismiss out of hand. And who knows -- she might be right. Maybe you are \r\nconnected to someone. ",
        "Paige: But who? And why is Lucy so certain that that person is here in Port \r\nCharles? ",
        "",
        "Amy: Evening, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Now, how did you know I was here? ",
        "Amy: Well, snakes make a distinctive sound when they slither across the \r\nfloor. ",
        "Chris: That's very cute. ",
        "Amy: Hmm. Why are you staring at me? ",
        "Chris: Not really staring. I was just thinking. ",
        "Amy: Heaven help us. ",
        "Chris: You remember a while back how you issued that little challenge for me?\r\n",
        "Amy: \"Challenge?\" ",
        "Chris: Yeah, you know, discovering your secrets, uncovering the truth. ",
        "Amy: Oh, what a relief. I thought you had forgotten it. ",
        "Chris: No, on the contrary, I've been working rather hard on it. Discovered \r\ninteresting things, too. ",
        "Amy: The proverbial dog with a bone. So, what will you fetch me now, rover?\r\n",
        "Chris: Well, for starters, you really do resemble your father. ",
        "",
        "Ian: It's a beautiful night. ",
        "Eve: Hmm. ",
        "Ian: What do you say we sit down and enjoy it? You up for that? ",
        "Eve: Yes. ",
        "Ian: Come on, little man. ",
        "Eve: Kind of in a strange mood tonight, aren't you? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I guess I am. ",
        "Eve: Does it have anything to do with your dinner with Amy? ",
        "Ian: I screwed up. ",
        "Eve: What'd you do, Ian? ",
        "Ian: I failed to mention to her that the reason I asked her out to dinner was \r\nto tell her that you and I are back together. And then when you didn't show up, \r\nshe got the wrong idea. ",
        "Eve: Great. ",
        "Ian: You know, and I know where she's coming from as well because the last \r\ntime I talked to her, our marriage was on the rocks. And then I asked her to \r\ndinner, said we should talk. ",
        "Eve: And she thought that you were going to leave me for her. ",
        "Ian: I'm so stupid. ",
        "Eve: No, no, no, no. Listen, that was her fantasy all along. It's ok. So, \r\nhow'd she take it when you told her the truth? ",
        "Ian: Was a wee bit embarrassed. But in the end she wished us well, I think.\r\n",
        "Eve: Well, good. Now she can move on. Come here, buddy. ",
        "Ian: Just think I could've handled it better, that's all. ",
        "Eve: You're my bud. You know what? She is a strong woman, Ian. She'll move \r\non. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. She's leaving in a few days to start her life over, start a new \r\nlife -- ",

        "Kevin: Paige, whatever your journey is, I'm sure you'll find it. And I have \r\nto believe that whatever that is, it must be something worthwhile. ",
        "Paige: Me, too. ",
        "Kevin: Somehow I believe that I must be connected to it. ",
        "Paige: I used to believe that, but -- ",
        "Kevin: For a reason. Look, you came to Port Charles. Your first instinct was \r\nto come to me. ",
        "Paige: That's because I wanted to see you one last time. ",
        "Kevin: I'm glad you did. ",
        "Paige: Even though I've been this dark cloud hanging over your family ever \r\nsince I got here? ",
        "Kevin: No, look, Paige, my close call was my own fault. And Christina's just \r\na little girl who happened to get sick. ",
        "Paige: Yes, and me, the angel of death, ready to take both of you over to the \r\nother side. ",
        "Kevin: But you didn't. That wasn't your purpose. But I'm sure that finishing \r\nyour portrait will lead you there somehow. ",
        "Paige: You're very sweet to say that. ",
        "Kevin: I mean it. And I'm sorry that you were taken before you had a chance \r\nto do everything you wanted to do. ",
        "Paige: Don't be sad. ",
        "Kevin: You were my friend, Paige. My best friend. And I'm just so sorry that \r\nyou died. ",

        "Alison: I have never been happier than I am at this very moment. I want to \r\ntell all of our friends and I want to -- I want to shout it from the rooftops \r\nthat I am your wife and you're my husband. ",
        "Rafe: So you're really not disappointed that we didn't have a real wedding \r\nwith all the trimmings? ",
        "Alison: What? No. No, this was as -- as real and as beautiful as any wedding \r\ncould get when two people are really, truly in love. ",
        "Rafe: I couldn't have said it better myself. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. But there just was one little thing that I wish maybe \r\nwould've been different. ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: I mean, our friends weren't here to celebrate it with us. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. Lucy would've loved this. And Serena -- she would've gone \r\nnuts over the whole thing. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and Livvie and Jack, they would've loved it, and my nana -- I'm \r\nso sorry -- my grandmother -- she would've loved it. ",
        "Rafe: Hey. You know what? Why don't we have a big wedding after all? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that would be great. I could meet your parents. ",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, I -- I wouldn't bet on that. ",
        "Rafe: What do you mean? They'd have to come. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. They would really try. But I'm sure that my dad would get \r\ncalled away on business or something to London on an emergency trip. And my mom, \r\nshe -- she really loves Paris this time of the year. I'm sure it would be really \r\nhard for her to get away. ",
        "Rafe: Come on, they can't be that bad. ",
        "Alison: No, they're not. They're not -- they're not terrible people at all. \r\nThey're -- they just should've never have had a child. ",
        "Rafe: Don't they know what they're missing? Don't they know what an \r\nincredible, amazing, beautiful daughter they have -- a daughter that could bring \r\nthem so much happiness if they would just let her? They can't know. Otherwise \r\nthey could never stand to leave her any more than I can. ",

        "Ian: You dropped this. ",

        "Chris: So I could only assume that the man standing behind you, looking so \r\nadmiringly at you, was your -- was your dear, old dad. I mean, the image was \r\nkind of blurry and I couldn't quite make it out, but then I got the idea -- hey, \r\nwhy not have it blown up and digitally enhanced?

Well, your name can't be Stradling because you had a necklace \r\non that said \"A.H.\" And whoever old man H is -- well, he must've been a real \r\nS.O.B. for you to be so ashamed to let anyone know that you're related to him.\r\n",
