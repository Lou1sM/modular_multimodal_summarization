        "Jamal: Yeah, he's about six feet tall, built like a Mack truck, goes by the \r\nname of J.D. No, no, no, don't -- don't do anything. You just call me. I'll \r\nhandle it. All right. Yeah. He's going to be sorry he ever messed with me. \r\nThanks. Later. What's up? ",
        "Jack: What do you think you're doing? ",
        "Jamal: Looking for J.D. ",

        "Casey: Ok, look, what are you going to do when you find him, huh? ",
        "Ricky: I don't know. ",
        "Casey: The guy who did this to you? ",
        "Ricky: I don't know, ok? I don't -- what do you do with pond scum? ",
        "Casey: Look, Ricky, just let it go. ",
        "Ricky: Mind your own business. ",
        "Casey: Now, we managed to keep the police out of this until now, all right? \r\nIf you start looking for revenge, they are going to be on you like white on \r\nrice. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah? Well, so what? ",
        "Casey: \"So what?\" Man, I thought that's what you were so afraid of. ",
        "Ricky: Well, I don't care anymore, Casey. ",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, I do. ",
        "Ricky: Why? ",
        "Casey: Because I -- I do, all right? That's all. I mean, anyway, how's that \r\nplastic surgeon going to fix you up if you're in the joint? ",
        "Ricky: Look, Casey, there's nothing that anybody can do for me, ok? ",
        "Casey: Ricky, look, Jamal and I talked to her, ok? She said she could help \r\nyou. ",

        "Eve: Oh! You should know better than to sneak up on a girl in the dark like \r\nthat. ",
        "Ian: There's worse things than being in the dark with you, believe me. ",
        "Eve: Forgotten how much I missed this. ",

        "Ricky: Bull. ",
        "Casey: Look, you cut your finger, I'm going to faint, ok? It's just because I \r\ncan't handle the sight of blood. Besides, man, it looks about 100 times better \r\nthan it did when you first -- ",
        "Ricky: Don't tell me that this is nothing, ok? Looks like a damn Halloween \r\nmask. ",
        "Casey: You know what? You know what's a lot scarier than your face? Huh? You \r\nsounding like some whiny baby. Man, I have never seen anybody so totally sorry \r\nfor themselves. Dude, you think this is the worst thing that would ever happen \r\nin the world. ",
        "Ricky: I don't care what you think, ok? Somebody messes up your life, you \r\ndon't just get over it. I'd rather die than look like this, Casey! ",
        "Casey: Don't say that, ok? You don't know what you're talking about, Ricky. \r\nKid, you don't know what it's like to die. ",

        "Jamal: Look, dude, you want to buy into this whole white picket fence thing \r\nyou got going on with Livvie, you want to pretend all that's real, go right \r\nahead, man. I'm booking out, all right? I walked away from all that. ",
        "Jack: No, you threw it away. ",
        "Jamal: Whatever, man. It's over. It's over. Look, why don't you back off? ",

        "Eve: Oh, no, we're not afraid of the dark, are we? No, we're not, because \r\nwe're a big boy now, huh? That's strange. The candle just went out all by \r\nitself. That's not good. That's not good at all, but you know what? Mommy's \r\ngoing to go and light a million more candles, ok? ",

        "Ricky: Yeah, what, did you read a book once? ",
        "Casey: Didn't need a book. ",
        "Ricky: Or, what, did you die and come back to life or something? ",
        "Casey: Or something. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, you've been watching too much \"Springer,\" Casey. ",
        "Casey: Is it really so hard to believe, Ricky? Huh? ",
        "Ricky: You're some piece of work, Casey -- a virgin who knows everything \r\nthere is to know about sex. One of the healthiest girls I've ever met who knows \r\neverything there is to know about being dead. ",
        "Casey: Oh, God, you make me nuts! ",
        "Ricky: Maybe you should go on one of those lecturing tours or get your own \r\nshow on a cable channel and tell people what it's like to die and go to heaven.\r\n",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, at least I know that someone like you won't get that, now, \r\nwill they? ",
        "Ricky: Well, thanks. You know what? Because at least you gave me a second to \r\nforget about this. Now get out of here, little girl. ",

        "Casey: Yeah, not like it matters, right? ",

        "Casey: Look, I can't get into details, all right? It's complicated. ",
        "Ricky: No, it's not complicated. So your time is up and you got bored, and \r\nnow you're getting out of here. ",
        "Casey: Yeah, pretty much. ",

        "Casey: Look, it's not pity, ok? Didn't you even hear a single word that I \r\nsaid to you? ",
        "Ricky: No. No, ok? Words are cheap. The past couple of weeks, you've been \r\nkeeping your distance from me. And now I get this, and you're telling me that \r\nyou're in love with me? ",
        "Casey: Look, I am, ok? And maybe, maybe seeing you all hurt made me finally \r\nrealize inside even more, Ricky. ",
        "Ricky: You're pathetic, you know that? You think I'm going to let a little \r\npunk like you get close to me? I will never give in to your pity. You are \r\nnothing but a joke. ",

        "Jack: Well, this is the first time I ever heard you speechless. Which is a \r\ngood thing because I'm not done with you. I've got more I want to say. No, just \r\nsit down. You want to fight after this, that's fine, but just hear me out first. \r\nNot too long ago, all I wanted to do was die. ",

        "Jack: No, it wasn't. ",

You stopped her from killing an innocent person. You saved \r\nAlison's life and probably mine and Livvie's, too. Hey, it sucks that Valerie \r\nhad to die, man. It does, but you had no control over her actions. It's not your \r\nfault. As far as I'm concerned, you're the hero. You kept your cool. You handled \r\nyour business and you did the right thing. Now, if you want to go kill yourself \r\nover that, then, well, I guess you're not the man I thought you were. ",
