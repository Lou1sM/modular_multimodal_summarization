        "Alison argues with Jack about the turn his life has taken. Jack fills Chris in on the situation with Tess and Caleb. Reese and Alison snipe at each other about Jack. Alison and Jack make up. Reese decides to turn Alison into a vampire. Caleb is displeased to find Tess looking at his family ring. Tess wants to throw it away, but he won't allow that. Instead, he places it on his finger. Rafe is convinced that the only difference between Ian and Elizabeth is that Ian never fed on anyone. Ian refuses to consider feeding. He would rather he dead than be like Caleb and the others. Caleb dreams that Livvie offers her neck to him, but when he tries to bite her, his fangs are gone. In the dream, Livvie blames Tess for this. Caleb is visibly shaken by the dream and has to get out of the villa. Rafe concedes that he may be missing something, but Ian doesn't think so. At Ian's insistence, Rafe agrees to kill him if there's no way out. Kevin catches Lucy stealing blood from the blood bank."

        "Jack: Tequila, straight up.",
        "Alison: Jack?",
        "Jack: What, Alison? You going to try to monitor my drinking now, too?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just wanted --",
        "Jack: Right, right. Here comes other lecture, right?",
        "Alison: No. Look, I'm worried about you.",
        "Jack: Well, you don't need to be.",
        "Alison: We're friends. I know you.",
        "Jack: Well, if you knew me, then you'd know I really don't want to talk right now. All right? So just let me live my life.",
        "Alison: Do you really want to live it like this? Jack, I know that Tess hurt you, and I just wanted to --",
        "Jack: Alison, Tess is not a part of my life anymore, so just drop it.",
        "Reese: Hey, lover. Who's the nuisance? Oh, it's only you. Still trying to save Jack's soul?",
        "Alison: Well, I guess somebody has to.",
        "Reese: And somebody has to teach you to butt out of it, sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Tess? What are you doing with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Look, Ian, I know you don't like this. But I think you have to be a full-blooded vampire before the hot spring cures you. You have to feed.",
        "Ian: Absolutely not.",
        "Lucy: Are -- are you sure? I mean, you think this is what he has to do?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I'm not 100% sure.",
        "Lucy: Well, then why are you even bringing it up right now?",
        "Rafe: It's the only thing that makes sense, all right? Just think about this. Think about it for a second. The only difference between your experience and Elizabeth's is that she's fed and you haven't.",
        "Ian: It's not an option.",
        "Rafe: Ian --",
        "Ian: I said it's not an option!",
        "Lucy: You -- you don't actually have proof that this will work, that this is what he has -- you don't have proof, right?",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth was cured by the healing pool. Ian wasn't. Nothing else makes sense. This does.",
        "Ian: Congratulations, you solved the mystery. I'm not doing it.",
        "Lucy: You might have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Can we please finish this talk alone?",
        "Reese: What are you, his keeper?",
        "Jack: Would you both give it a rest? Hey, big brother. Long time no see. Let me buy you a drink, huh?",
        "Chris: No, I'm good. What's with the blonds?",
        "Jack: Ah, never mind them.",
        "Chris: Is that the one from the Stephen Clay Experience?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Chris: She looks like she wants to devour you.",
        "Jack: That's an interesting choice of words.",
        "Chris: Well, where's Tess?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: It's all over.",
        "Chris: What do you mean, it's all over? She's the most remarkable girl in the world. You're not cheating on her with that, are you?",
        "Jack: Sit down. We really need to talk more, Chris.",
        "Chris: What's going on?",
        "Jack: Things just keep getting weirder here in Port Charles.",
        "Chris: Yeah, ok.",
        "Jack: What if I were to tell you that Tess was created from Livvie? Caleb had his sights set on Livvie, ok? But in order to get her, he had to send the good part of her out to the woods. That became Tess. Well, I find the good part and I fall in love with her. And over a period of time, she happens to be drawn to Caleb just like Livvie. And now --",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: Now they live happily ever after.",
        "Chris: I think I will take that drink, after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Jack's a big boy. Why don't you let him play like one?",
        "Alison: Because I don't trust you, and neither should he.",
        "Reese: What, you afraid I'm going to bite him?",
        "Alison: Well, that is what you do, isn't it?",
        "Reese: You don't have to worry about it because it's too late.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Reese: I already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I was looking for something else when I found that ring.",
        "Caleb: Why didn't you just leave it where it was?",
        "Tess: Because I had a bad feeling about it. It has dark powers.",
        "Caleb: I'll put it away. You won't ever have to see it again.",
        "Tess: No, Caleb, I -- I don't want it here. I'll throw it away.",
        "Caleb: No, you won't. It's part of my heritage.",
        "Tess: A heritage you didn't -- you didn't want and you didn't choose.",
        "Caleb: You can't just erase your past.",
        "Tess: But I thought that's what you wanted -- to break away from your past, from the darkness you lived in, Caleb. You can just be a man with me.",
        "Caleb: It's still part of who I am.",
        "Tess: This isn't just about the ring. This is about last night when I got up-- upset and scared by your fangs.",
        "Caleb: No.",
        "Tess: I thought we made up.",
        "Caleb: I'm not mad at you, Tess.",
        "Tess: But you're scared. You don't think you can change, but I know you can. I can help you be the man you've always wanted to be. You didn't need those fangs to make love and you don't need that ring.",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry you don't like it. But you can't just throw it away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: What are you saying, that I should hit the streets of Port Charles and find myself a donor?",
        "Lucy: No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all.",
        "Ian: Good. That's good because I'm not going to turn into some animal --",
        "Rafe: Ian, I don't like this any more than you do, but if I thought there was some other way, I wouldn't even be suggesting this!",
        "Lucy: This -- this is your life we're talking about.",
        "Ian: I know it's my life, and it's my choice. And if I did this, I couldn't live with myself. You know that.",
        "Lucy: I -- I do. But we're trying to save your life, and if this is the way we have to do it, then we have to find a way to do that.",
        "Ian: How?",
        "Lucy: I -- I don't know how.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: What I do know is I -- I love you, and there's no way in hell I'm about to lose you.",
        "Ian: And what do you think, I want to lose you? I want to drive this out of me and I want to have a life with you. That's what I want.",
        "Lucy: Ok, then, please --",
        "Ian: But, you know --",
        "Lucy: Please --",
        "Ian: If I -- if I feed on someone, I'm -- I'm just like Caleb.",
        "Lucy: No, you're not. That's not true at all.",
        "Ian: What I want is to fight this so that you can be with me, the man you love, and I can be a father to my son.",
        "Lucy: You would still be that man, and you will always be that man. Yes. Yes.",
        "Ian: If I put my teeth in someone's neck, I would be just like them. And I'd rather be dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You're lying. I would know if you bit Jack.",
        "Reese: Oh, would you? He tasted so good.",
        "Alison: You are such a little bitch.",
        "Reese: Gotcha. Just relax. I haven't bitten Jack -- not yet, anyway.",
        "Alison: You need to stay away from him.",
        "Reese: Sorry, honey, he doesn't want to stay away from me.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Alison: That's funny. It kind of looks like he's a little sick of you already.",
        "Reese: The only thing he's sick of is your whining. Look, Jack knows what I am, and he likes it. Actually, he'd like some for himself, too.",
        "Alison: Really? I'm surprised anyone would want to be like you.",
        "Reese: Ha. You have no idea.",
        "Alison: No, I do. I suppose, since you know him so well, he told you that he was bit before?",
        "Reese: Of course. We share everything.",
        "Alison: So then I'm sure he told you about how he tried to kill himself because he was so disgusted and tortured by what he was. No? Oh, no, he didn't tell you, did he? I was there. I saw it all, ok? You got to leave him alone. He's hurting, and he's looking for something else so that he can hurt more. Just stay away from him.",
        "Reese: You know, you need to stop listening to that slayer boyfriend of yours because he leaves out all the good parts.",
        "Alison: Look, don't, ok? Don't sit here and talk to me like what you do is some sort of hobby. You feed off of other people. You're like a nasty little monster.",
        "Reese: Hey!",
        "Alison: I promise you, I will do whatever I have to to make sure that you stay away from Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Ok. You're telling me Livvie and Tess are one and the same, except for a while when they weren't?",
        "Jack: They were looking to come home to each other, and I just happened to be the pit stop on the way. I sure know how to pick them, don't I?",
        "Chris: That doesn't make sense. I mean, Tess could heal. I mean, when she touched me, it was unbelievable. And Livvie -- there's no way --",
        "Jack: Chris -- look, don't even try to figure it out, all right? It's not worth it. Besides, I am done thinking about both of them.",
        "Chris: Unbelievable.",
        "Jack: You know, I used to think you were a jerk, the way you could just live your life always thinking of yourself.",
        "Chris: Thanks.",
        "Jack: But I got to tell you, I agree with you 100%. Because all you can do is take care of yourself.",
        "Chris: That's your new philosophy, too?",
        "Jack: Try to be a hero, end up a sap. And I'm done being that guy.",
        "Alison: You know what? That's too bad because I didn't think that that guy was a sap. I thought he was a pretty good guy. As a matter of fact, I thought that he was my best friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I am not going to allow you to die. Our world will go back to normal. We will make it go back to normal. So you have to -- we have to try something.",
        "Ian: Yeah. We'll try something.",
        "Lucy: Right, because there has to be another way. There has to be so that you don't have to live with the idea of feeding on anybody.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry, guys. I -- I really wish I had better news.",
        "Ian: That's all right. It's what it is. You know?",
        "Lucy: I -- I need to go just for a walk, you know, and clear my head. Ok?",
        "Ian: Sounds like a good plan, then.",
        "Lucy: Um -- you never know, you know. Maybe I'll come up with something.",
        "Ian: Maybe you will.",
        "Lucy: Maybe I will.",
        "Ian: Go.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok. Cousin.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rafe: You know, people consider me a vampire expert, but there's one thing I'll never know -- I've told you this before and it's true -- I will never know what it is you're going through right now. I mean, I've seen so many people get bit, and they just embrace and give in to what they've become. I can't even imagine how hard it is to fight that. So, for what it's worth, I am in complete awe of you.",
        "Ian: That means a lot.",
        "Rafe: We are going to do whatever we have to do, anything we have to do to get you out of this.",
        "Ian: Sure. We'll do that. But I think we both know that there may not be a way out for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Tess?",
        "Livvie: Don't let her do this to you. Don't let her do this to you.",
        "Caleb: Do what? Olivia.",
        "Livvie: I love all of you, Caleb. All of you.",
        "Caleb: She saved me. Tess knows the man I want to be.",
        "Livvie: I know the person you are. The man that you've become. I love you, Caleb. I love you, Caleb. I love you, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: What do you want from me?",
        "Livvie: Nothing. Just be yourself. You don't have to hold anything back with me. Feed on me, Caleb.",
        "Livvie: Your fangs -- they're gone. What has she done to you?",
        "Tess: What's wrong?",
        "Tess: Did you have another nightmare?",
        "Caleb: No. No.",
        "Tess: Where are you going?",
        "Caleb: An idea for a -- for a song just came to me. I want to get to the studio while it's still in my head.",
        "Tess: I was hoping we could talk when you woke up.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, we will talk. Not now, later.",
        "Tess: You're -- you're still upset with me.",
        "Caleb: I'll be back soon.",
        "Livvie's voice: What has she done to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Well. Livvie is Tess, Tess is Livvie. Caleb's alive. Think I'm going to move to Guam.",
        "Jack: Don't move too far, all right?",
        "Chris: Yeah, take care. And keep your good news to yourself next time.",
        "Jack: Listen, Alison, I'm not going to go at it with you again.",
        "Alison: I didn't come here to talk to you about Reese.",
        "Jack: Oh, you didn't?",
        "Alison: No. Jack, I love you and you're my best friend.",
        "Jack: You make it real hard to stay mad at you, don't you?",
        "Alison: I just want you to be safe, ok?",
        "Jack: I can handle Reese. I promise. Come here.",
        "Reese: Probably telling Jack what a monster I am. Well, let's see how you feel when you're like me, Alison. Let's see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You've been fighting these creatures most of your life, so you tell me, are we missing something? I mean, other than killing Caleb, there's no way to get me back to normal.",
        "Rafe: No. But we'll find another way.",
        "Ian: We found another way -- the healing pool. It's not working for me.",
        "Rafe: Ok, maybe I was wrong, all right? Maybe there's another difference.",
        "Ian: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think there is no other difference. I think you're right.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Ian: I need you to promise me something.",
        "Rafe: It won't come to that.",
        "Ian: Maybe not. But if it does, I want Lucy, I want Danny, I want everyone to be safe.",
        "Rafe: They will be. They will -- we found a way! They'll be fine!",
        "Ian: Yeah. All the vampires are fed, so the healing pool will work for them. That includes Caleb.",
        "Rafe: Yes. Yeah, and then he won't be able to come back. All of his vampire powers will be gone.",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. And not just his powers -- all the vampires are going to be cured. Everyone except me. And, eventually, I'm going to lose control.",
        "Rafe: No.",
        "Ian: I have already, and if Lucy hadn't been there -- and she saved me, you know --",
        "Rafe: And she will keep saving you! Don't you get that?",
        "Ian: And what kind of man does that make me? What kind of a father to my son?",
        "[Rafe sighs]",
        "Rafe: What are you saying?",
        "Ian: We both know that eventually I will feed, and this nightmare is going to start all over again. And everyone that's in my life in any way is going to be in danger.",
        "Rafe: But --",
        "Ian: We can't let this happen, Rafe. So when I'm the last vampire standing, you got to do the right thing. Promise me. Promise me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Ian needs to feed for that pool to cure him. So, this way, I guess he doesn't have to bite anybody.",
        "Kevin: Picking up takeout for the boyfriend?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Kevin: The girls -- I don't even want to imagine how upset they'd be if they knew Mommy was dating Dracula.",
        "Caleb: Something's missing.",
        "Tess: You'll find it, Caleb. I know you will.",
        "Livvie: Maybe I can help you fix it, my love.",
        "Joshua: I'm starving!",
        "Elizabeth: No! No!"
