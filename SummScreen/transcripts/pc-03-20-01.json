        "Jamal: Oh, man. I still cannot believe we pulled it off. ",
        "Jack: Oh, hell of a thing your friends \r\npitching in to help us pass inspection. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, man, yeah. Tell me about it. I mean, when Alison -- when she \r\nsprained her ankle, man -- I thought it was over. ",
        "Jack: Where is she, anyway? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, she'll be here. She said she has something to do first. I don't \r\nknow. ",
        "Jack: I just didn't think she'd miss something like this. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. What about Livvie? I thought for sure she'd be dropping by \r\nfirst thing in the morning, checking things out. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I don't think so. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, dude. I saw you guys working yesterday, and I was \r\ndefinitely getting a vibe between you two. ",
        "Jack: Yeah? So was I. Till she put up that big wall she puts up -- you know, \r\nher usual M.O. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, man, what's up with that? ",
        "Jack: Honestly, I don't care. I basically told her to have a nice life. \r\nBesides, man, forget about all that. It's showtime, baby. Let's go, open up, \r\nopen up. ",
        "Jamal: Easy, easy, man. Come on. It's not like there's a big line of people \r\nwaiting outside my -- ",

        "Lucy: Oh, wait. Here. Hey. Here. I can help you. Let me help. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no. Actually, Lucy, I got this part, but could you get the door \r\nfor me, please? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Wait, don't tell me you deliver now? This is so great. I don't \r\ncook! ",
        "Alison: Oh, no. No, actually, we don't. It's just it's the opening day at the \r\nbike shop, you know, so I'm just bringing some -- ",
        "Lucy: Oh, the bike -- ",
        "Alison: Coffee for the guys. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that's right. I heard about that. I heard about that. I heard \r\nabout the bike shop. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, it's going to be fun. You should stop by. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I will. You know, I would like to see it. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Victor: So we're all set? That's excellent! All we have to do is wait for the \r\nword from Ian. Now, Pete -- no, no, no, no. I'll be in touch with you. And, \r\nPete? Nobody -- that means nobody -- can know about this. No, no, I know you do. \r\nAnd thanks for all your good work. ",

        "Amanda: I assure you -- ",
        "Jamal: Let me fill in the blanks. All right, you sent a building inspector on \r\nus to try to shut us down. ",
        "Amanda: You give me far too much credit. I simply came by to wish you both \r\nwell in your new venture. ",
        "Jamal: That's the only reason why you came by? ",
        "Amanda: And to extend an invitation. ",
        "Jamal: An invitation. ",
        "Amanda: An old family friend of Alison's came back into town. ",
        "Jamal: So? ",
        "Amanda: I'm planning to give a dinner party in Chad's honor, and I would like \r\nfor you both to come. ",

        "Jack's Voice: Livvie, do you want to let one stupid night -- when I got drunk \r\nand nothing happened -- stand in the way of us being together? Or do you want to \r\nlet yourself feel all the good stuff that you really feel? ",

        "Livvie: Oh, hi. ",
        "Kevin: This a bad time? ",
        "Livvie: No, actually. Grandma's out with the nurse, and I was just -- why \r\ndon't you come on in? ",
        "Kevin: Thanks. I'm sorry I didn't call first. I was in the neighborhood, and \r\n-- to be honest, I've missed you. ",
        "Livvie: So I heard you and Lucy got back together. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. And I know you're still angry at her for what happened with \r\nJack. ",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe you can get over her and Jack being together, but I \r\ncan't. ",
        "Kevin: Well, try and remember there were extenuating circumstances. First, \r\nyou and I had just broken up with them both. Second, they didn't know who each \r\nother were. And, third, they'd done a fair amount of drowning their sorrows -- \r\nover us. ",
        "Livvie: And, four, you were all keeping it from me. ",
        "Kevin: So we're hereby convicted of being flawed human beings and therefore \r\nbanished from your life. Is that how it works? Livvie, I know a lot of people \r\nhave let you down, but if you start closing the door on everyone who makes a \r\nmistake, the world is going to get pretty lonely pretty fast. ",
        "",
        "Victor: Lucy, I'm so glad to see you because maybe I won't forget again that \r\nMary wants to have you and Monk come over for dinner. Any night would be good. \r\nExcept Monday -- Mary works Mondays, and Wednesdays I have my Toastmasters. \r\nFridays -- but Fridays we just started our bambuca classes. Bambuca, of course, \r\nis the national ballroom dance of Colombia. You know, you and Monk really ought \r\nto take advantage of their trial class -- no obligation -- because you're tall. \r\nAnd bambuca is a -- ",
        "Lucy: Stop, Victor. Just stop. You're changing the subject. You know me \r\nbetter than that. I will get back to the subject I want to speak about, so let's \r\ndo it now. ",
        "Victor: What? ",
        "Lucy: You know what I'm talking about -- Ian. There is some sort of big thing \r\ngoing on with Ian, and I want to know what it is, and no one will tell me, which \r\nmakes me more determined to find out what it is, so just tell me. ",
        "Victor: Lucy, hush. ",

        "Lucy: M.Y.O. what? ",
        "Victor: Mind your own business. And I mean it, Lucy. ",

        "Eve: Oh, I love you so much. I'm so afraid. ",
        "Ian: Afraid of what? ",
        "Eve: That this is getting away from us. Somehow we're losing control. ",
        "Ian: I'm losing control right now. ",
        "Eve: No, no, I'm serious. Wait. Wait. Last night this couple came into the \r\nER. And every time he tells her that he wants out of the marriage, she hurts \r\nherself. So now he's stuck in this loveless marriage. ",
        "Ian: The way I'm stuck with Arianna. ",
        "Eve: I'm afraid you're never going to leave her. And not -- not because -- \r\nlook, I'm afraid that you are worried that she won't be ok without you. And I \r\nknow this is not her fault, but this situation is just taking on a life of its \r\nown. ",
        "Ian: We just have to be patient. ",
        "Eve: She told you she loves you. The longer this goes on, the harder it's \r\ngoing to be for everyone. ",

        "Ian: And what's that? ",
        "Eve: Arianna is your wife, and you share everything with her, and she is this \r\nbeautiful, amazing woman who loves you and adores you, and she, most of all, \r\nneeds you. She needs you, and I'm me. ",

        "Livvie: How do I let go when every time I remember I just get angry all over \r\nagain? ",

        "Livvie: That you two really love each other. ",
        "Kevin: And we've been able to do that by learning how to forgive. ",
        "Livvie: All right. What do you do when -- when your head tells you one thing, \r\nbut your heart completely tells you something else? ",

        "Amanda: So what am I supposed to do? Leave Chad hanging? ",
