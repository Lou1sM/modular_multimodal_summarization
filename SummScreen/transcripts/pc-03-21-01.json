        "Frank: Hi. ",
        "Karen: Sorry. Do I know you from somewhere? ",
        "Frank: I am sorry about last night. I said I would call. I should have \r\ncalled, but -- ",
        "Karen: You got hung up. Let me guess -- she's about this high, this wide, \r\nugly as sin, lives in your garage? ",
        "Frank: I know you think I'm crazy, but that old computer works. I made \r\ncontact again. ",
        "Karen: I'm sorry. You've mistaken me for someone that gives a damn. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I am actually capable of keeping a secret, you know? ",
        "Ian: Can I buy you a beer? ",
        "Lucy: You're changing the subject. All right, but I want you to know you can \r\ntrust me. ",
        "Ian: I know I can trust you, but I don't know if I can trust myself to \r\nexplain what may be a very sensitive situation. ",
        "Lucy: Aha, sensitive. You said that word. Ok, so this situation between you \r\nand Eve and your little wife Arianna is sensitive, complicated, and dangerous, \r\nright? ",
        "Ian: I didn't say dangerous, did I? ",
        "Lucy: But maybe you wanted to because Victor said it. And Victor told me I \r\ncouldn't ask him any more questions, but that doesn't mean if you feel the need \r\nto talk to me, you go ahead. Don't stop yourself. ",
        "Ian: I'm a man of few words, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, then why don't you use those few choice words and just explain how \r\nEve's doing in this situation. How is she? ",
        "Ian: Eve is going through more than any woman should have to. ",
        "Lucy: Because she loves you. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. I must be a lucky man, indeed. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. So, ok, Mr. Lucky, I have a little advice for you. I've known Eve \r\na long time, and she's not going to just wait around forever, you know. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Listen, Arianna -- ",
        "Arianna: No, you listen, Eve. Stay away from my husband. Immigration is \r\nwatching every step Ian and I make, trying to prove our marriage isn't real. ",
        "Eve: I know that and -- ",
        "Arianna: Do you know what would happen if they saw you the way I just saw you \r\nand Ian, kissing -- like lovers? I'd be deported. And I would be killed the \r\nmoment I set foot back home in my country. You're playing with my life with your \r\ndisgusting behavior. ",
        "Eve: Hey! Just a minute. I'll be damned if I will stand here and let you call \r\nour behavior disgusting. Ian and I love each other. ",
        "Arianna: That doesn't mean -- ",
        "Eve: No, listen to me. We have survived a lot together. We almost died. ",
        "Arianna: I understand. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Then understand this -- Ian and I will be together. We only stopped \r\nalong the way to help you before we move on with our lives. Arianna, I know it \r\nlooks like I'm the bad guy here, ok? But really, I'm not. ",
        "Arianna: You really are a beautiful woman, Eve. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Arianna: A beautiful, educated, passionate woman -- and a doctor. You're \r\neverything a man in this country could wish for. It's only natural Ian wants to \r\nbe with you. ",
        "Eve: But? ",
        "Arianna: But we both know I can't let Ian go. I can't and I won't. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Livvie told me you'd done a job fixing the place up, but she didn't do \r\nit justice. Congratulations. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. I'm so proud, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: You should be. ",
        "Alison: You know, and Livvie was right there. You know, anytime we needed an \r\nextra hand, she was right there to give it. ",
        "Kevin: I'm really glad that you two have become friends. She needs people \r\nthat she can count on. ",
        "Alison: I know. Who doesn't, you know? Oh, ok, well, let me give you a tour.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Alison: Um, it's really not that big, so there's not a lot to show you, but \r\n-- ",
        "Kevin: You hurt your leg. ",
        "Alison: Oh -- no, just an ankle, but I'm fine. Just another battle scar from \r\nNana. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you've had plenty of those lately, haven't you? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Actually, I have. But they just kind of seem to get easier and \r\neasier to get over, you know? What -- what is that look for? ",
        "Kevin: I'm really proud of you. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Listen, you, I am serious here. I just don't think Eve is going to wait \r\naround forever, even for you. ",
        "Ian: She knows what's going on, and she knows how I feel about her. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Well, that's very logical and that's great, and sometimes in your \r\nhead, you know, you wait -- you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait. \r\nThen sometimes something happens in your heart and you can't wait anymore and \r\nyou just snap and you got out and do something dreadfully stupid. ",
        "Ian: You're speaking from experience? ",
        "Lucy: Um, I'm an expert on something stupid. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. And who made you an expert? ",
        "Lucy: I'm not going to tell you. I don't want to share that right now. What I \r\nneed to tell you is I don't want Eve to go out there and do something stupid.\r\n",
        "Ian: Because? ",
        "Lucy: Because it could hurt or affect a lot of people. ",
        "Ian: Including you. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, me, and -- and Doc. I mean, you know, just for a minute, picture \r\nEve going out and doing something stupid like throwing yourself back at Kevin. I \r\ndon't want that to happen. I want to be the person throwing myself at Kevin \r\nevery day for the rest of my life throughout time, thank you very much. ",
        "Ian: You can do that. It's nothing to worry about. ",
        "Lucy: You really think so? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I know Eve a lot better than you think I do. In fact, I've always \r\nknown her. ",
        "Lucy: That's very sweet. I mean, I get that part -- I mean, through the sands \r\nof time, through the facets of the Iwo Jima sands of time -- I get all that \r\nromance stuff. That's what you're talking about, right -- forever? ",
        "Ian: That's it. ",
        "Lucy: That's it. What do you mean that -- that's it. You're serious, aren't \r\nyou? Are you -- wait, wait, wait, you're saying literally? Are you -- no, no, \r\nno, no, don't you dare do that. You're serious, aren't you? You literally \r\nbelieve that you knew Eve before in another lifetime? That's it, isn't it? ",
        "",
        "Arianna: My life is at stake, Eve. I can't let Ian go. ",
        "Eve: You can't blackmail him, either. ",
        "Arianna: I don't intend to. ",
        "Eve: You know damn well that he won't walk away from you if you're in \r\ntrouble. ",
        "Arianna: That's just one of the reasons why I care about him so much. ",
        "Eve: Then if you care about him, why are you pushing him to be someplace that \r\nhe doesn't want to be? ",
        "Arianna: Ian makes his own choices. ",
        "Eve: So do you, Arianna. Look, you have come so far and fought so hard to get \r\nhere. You left your whole life behind -- your family, your friends, everything \r\n-- just so you could start a new life here. Now, is this the type of woman you \r\nwant people to see you as? The kind of woman that will hold a man hostage to his \r\nhonor? ",
        "Arianna: You just don't know. ",
        "Eve: What I know is that you will be forcing a man who doesn't love you, a \r\nman who saved your life, to give up his happiness and his dreams just to stay \r\nmarried to you. Is that the kind of woman you are? Is that the kind of woman you \r\nwant to be?",

        "Kevin: Wow! Would you look at this baby. ",
        "Alison: Well, you know about bikes, too? ",
        "Kevin: A little. ",
        "Alison: Well, Jamal bought this one cheap, and he's fixing it up for sale.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I used to have one of these. ",
        "Alison: You used to ride a motorcycle? ",
        "Kevin: When I was younger. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: When I lived in Switzerland, and, no, you don't have to act so \r\nsurprised. ",
        "Alison: No, no, I'm not. I'm not surprised. Huh. I've got a great idea. Why \r\ndon't you take this out for a ride? ",
        "Kevin: It's been a long time since I was on one of these. ",
        "Alison: Huh? ",
        "Kevin: No, I -- oh, what the heck. Ah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, there you go. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, admit it -- I look as out of place as you thought I would. ",
        "Alison: No, no. Actually, I think you look kind of cool. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Karen, look. ",
        "Karen: Sorry, Frank. I'm on duty. ",
        "Frank: I would like to make this up to you. I know I screwed up, but this \r\nthing is nagging at me. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, obviously. ",
        "Frank: I just wish I knew who was sending me those messages and why she's \r\ndoing it. ",
        "Karen: She? Oh, so your imaginary cyber buddy is a she? Well, now I \r\nunderstand why you're so interested. It's not a computer thing. It's a guy \r\nthing. ",
        "Frank: I'm not crazy, Karen. ",
        "Karen: I think old Nellie did her job. Ok, because of her, she got us \r\ntogether, and because of her, we started hanging out and getting close. ",
        "Frank: And Nellie's been our good-luck charm. ",
        "Karen: But three's a crowd, Frank. I don't think we need Nellie anymore. ",
        "Frank: You're talking about throwing her out? ",
        "Karen: No. I'd give her a decent burial first. But, yes, I think it's time. \r\nAnd I think it's time we got out of the garage and into another room before \r\nNellie pulls apart what she brought together. ",
        "",
        "Ian: All I meant was that Eve and I are on the same wave length, rather like \r\nyou and Kevin think you are. ",
        "Lucy: Don't do that to me. Look, you know me better than that. Don't -- don't \r\nsnow me like that. Come on. We've talked about this. I really -- I do believe \r\nthat people can be together in past lives and they keep meeting each other over \r\nand over again and they're together. ",
        "Ian: You do believe that, don't you? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I do with all my heart. But all I have to go on is blind faith. I \r\nthink what you're saying is you actually have proof. Don't you? I can feel that \r\nyou do. ",
        "Ian: Let me tell you this. If -- if -- there were a way to go back to a past \r\nlife, I probably wouldn't be talking about it. ",
        "Lucy: But you are talking about it. So you did -- you did. Oh, my God, you \r\nreally had an experience with Eve, didn't you? Tell me. Ok, fine. You know what? \r\nIf you won't tell me right now, I am going to climb up on this stool and I am \r\ngoing to yell to everybody loudly that I know something that they'd like to \r\nknow. ",
        "Ian: Lucy, please -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I'll get on my knees and beg you. ",
        "Ian: Please, no. Listen, listen. Don't make a spectacle of yourself, woman.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Tell me, then, now. Tell me everything, please. Tell me. ",
        "Ian: Eve and I -- no. Eve and I had an experience. We went to a past life, \r\nand we were lovers. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. I want to do that. You have to show me how. ",
        "Ian: No. No, no, no. ",
        "Lucy: Take me there. At least show me how. Please let me try. I want to do \r\nthis. ",
        "Ian: Woman, there's no kit for this. It's a complex, dangerous thing, all \r\nright? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Then just tell me this -- how many lives did you actually see? ",
        "Ian: I saw one. Eve saw two. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Ok. So in both, did you live happily ever after? ",
        "Ian: No. No, in both lifetimes, we died without being together. But I do \r\nthink that this is the time. Right now, this is the time. No matter what the \r\nobstacles are, this is it. ",
        "Lucy: But you have to feel it, right? Don't you? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, and I do, but, um -- ",
        "Lucy: But, um, but, um, what, Ian? Eve doesn't? She doesn't? ",
        "Ian: No, Eve thinks this is going to end the same way the others did. ",
        "Lucy: You don't believe that, do you? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I know you're not a horrible person, Arianna. You're just making a \r\nhorrible choice. You know this isn't right, and in your heart, you know that Ian \r\ndoesn't want this. ",
        "Arianna: Ian married me to save my life, but things have changed. We've grown \r\nso much closer over time. Ian cares for me. I know. I could tell when he kissed \r\nme. And it was wonderful. And there was much more behind it then he's willing to \r\nadmit. ",
        "Eve: You misunderstood. ",
        "Arianna: Eve, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I didn't mean to \r\nfall in love with him. ",
        "Eve: I know that, Arianna. I believe you, I really do, but that doesn't \r\nchange things. You know what Ian wants. ",
        "Arianna: It's only what he says he wants. ",
        "Eve: You have to listen to what Ian is telling you. You have to listen to \r\nwhat I am telling you. ",
        "Arianna: All I know for sure is that he's everything I've ever dreamed about. \r\nI love him. ",
        "Eve: This dream doesn't belong to you. ",
        "Arianna: Then Ian and I will have to make a new one together. ",
        "Eve: I won't let you do that. ",
        "Arianna: I won't let you stop me. ",
        "Ian: What's going on, here? ",
        "Eve: Ask your wife. ",
        "",
        "Frank: So you think I'm banging my head up against the wall trying to make \r\nNellie work? ",
        "Karen: Right. And as a doctor, I must warn you that sustained head trauma \r\nisn't good. And as someone who cares about you, I think you could put your time \r\nto much, much better use. ",
        "Frank: What are you getting at? ",
        "Karen: Well, I prescribe lots of human companionship, long walks with me, \r\nromantic dinners with me, and lots of dancing with me. ",
        "Frank: All that matters is that you're home now with me, where you belong. \r\nAnd I guess I'm going to be pretty busy showing you how much you mean to me. ",
        "Karen: What about Nellie? ",
        "Frank: Well, looks like I've got a date with a dumpster. ",
        "Karen: Good. Because I don't want you looking at a screen. I want you looking \r\nat me. Frank, it took us a long time to find our way to each other. Let's not \r\nwaste a moment on anything with us. ",
        "Singer: o/~ If I could save time in a bottle the first thing that I'd like to \r\ndo is to save every day till eternity passes away just to spend them with you \r\no/~ ",

        "Lucy: It said I couldn't wait to see you. ",
        "Kevin: How come? ",
        "Lucy: Do I need a reason? Wait a minute. Is this -- you look amazing. ",
        "Kevin: I'll get to that. And, no, you don't need a reason, but I have a \r\nfeeling that you do. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, yes. I do. I do. It's about soul mates. It's about how I believe \r\nthat. You know how I believe that, you know, lovers could have been past lovers \r\nin past lives somewhere in time, right? I believe that, you know. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, what about it? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok -- Doc, what if told you that it could actually happen? What if \r\nI told you there's a place that we can go -- maybe an island or somewhere -- \r\nthat we could actually go back and relive our past lives together. What would \r\nyou say? ",
        "Kevin: I'd say you'd be on the first boat there. ",
        "Lucy: Of course I would, but I certainly wouldn't go without you. ",
        "Kevin: Well, now, of course islands like that are always people BYOS. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Kevin: Bring your own soul mate. ",

        "Kevin: I guess it's possible. ",
        "Lucy: It is. I think it is. Like, what if you were a pirate and maybe I was \r\nyour wench, hmm? Or, but -- wait, wait, better, better. You were emperor of the \r\nentire world. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I like it. ",

I am not going to allow my feelings to go there because \r\nthe old Eve would have been right out that door after them causing some trouble. \r\nYeah. Nope. It's the new Eve. I am patient and understanding and patient. Screw \r\nit. To hell with the old Eve. Maturity's for wussies, and patience is for \r\nsomebody else. Hey, it's me. I was just checking to see if you were there. Well, \r\nwhy do you think? I want to come over. I am ready to party. Yes! The old \r\nEve is back in town. Oh. Well, good. Line them up.
