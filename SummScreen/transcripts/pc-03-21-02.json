        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: And we're almost to the place where your special surprise is. ",
        "Alison: Ok, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Rafe: What? What? ",
        "Alison: Wait, I know where we are. ",
        "Rafe: No, you don't. ",
        "Alison: We're at the barn -- ",
        "Rafe: No. ",
        "Alison: In our special place. ",
        "Rafe: How do you know that? ",
        "Alison: We are! Because -- ",
        "Rafe: How do you know that? ",
        "Alison: Because it's the purple little flowers, the wildflowers. It's the \r\nonly place that I've seen them. I'm sorry. ",
        "Rafe: Leave it to you to remember how they smell. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you have ruined my surprise. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no! ",
        "Rafe: We might as well go home. ",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no. No. Just being with you makes me really happy, ok? \r\nBecause every minute we have together is a gift. ",
        "Rafe: Well, I just, you know, had a little picnic planned. Maybe we could \r\ntake a nap, and, you know, maybe stay the night again. ",
        "Alison: Well, I think that maybe I'm a little overdressed for the loft. ",
        "Rafe: Well, let's just see about that. ",
        "[Alison gasps] ",
        "Alison: Oh, Rafe. ",

        "Kevin: Paige? ",
        "Paige: In here, Kevin -- the studio. Time, isn't it? ",
        "Kevin: Almost. Ready to go? ",
        "Paige: Not remotely. I don't have the slightest desire to go back to London \r\nat all. I don't want to leave, Kevin -- this place, this house, you, Christina, \r\nthe life I've found here. I -- I just can't let it go, Kevin. I just can't walk \r\naway. I just can't. ",
        "Eve: Amy? I'm waiting. ",
        "Amy: I don't know what to say. ",
        "Eve: Ok, well, then let me help you get started. You broke into our apartment \r\nlast night with the key that you never returned. ",
        "Ian: What is this all about? ",
        "Eve: Ask her. She broke in and stole something. ",
        "Chris: There was a picture of her and her father. You remember that one, \r\nright, don't you there, Amy? ",
        "Amy: How could I possibly forget? ",
        "Ian: This doesn't make any sense. ",
        "Chris: Well, it does if you know how hard she's tried to prevent anyone from \r\nseeing the picture and the person who's in it with her. ",
        "Eve: Her father, apparently. ",
        "Chris: A real cold-looking S.O.B., too. ",
        "Amy: You go to hell! ",
        "Chris: Hey, I told you I'd figure it out, A.H. ",
        "Ian: A.H.? ",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah, Ian, how could you possibly have known? See, in this \r\npicture, Amy's wearing a necklace with her initials. The initials are A.H. Not \r\nA.S., so Stradling is not her last name. Unless, of course, the H is silent. ",
        "Ian: Amy? ",
        "Amy: I don't have the faintest idea about any of this. And if you think I'm \r\ngoing to stand here and let you interrogate me for no reason, you can think \r\nagain. ",
        "Ian: Amy, wait a second. Hang on. ",
        "Chris: Hey, you know what? Let her go, because she probably destroyed that \r\npicture by now, anyway. ",
        "Ian: I think I helped her shred it. ",
        "Chris: Well, that's ok, because I have my laptop here, and I happen to have a \r\ncopy of that picture on disc. ",
        "Amy: No! I won't let you look at it! ",
        "Chris: Hey, what are you doing? ",
        "Amy: No, stop it! People, just leave me alone! ",

        "Alison: Oh, Rafe, it's beautiful. ",
        "Rafe: Well, it's -- pretty. Yes, but beautiful is you. ",
        "Alison: I don't even know where to look first. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you just keep looking right here till you see how much it means \r\nto me to see you happy like this. ",
        "Alison: Oh, I see. ",
        "Rafe: So now you can feast your eyes on the rest of it. And then we'll work \r\non hearing and tasting -- ",
        "Alison: Wait, smell. Wait. What is that smell? ",
        "Rafe: Hey, all your favorites. ",
        "Alison: Oh, good, because I'm starving! ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, you can't touch it till the company comes. ",
        "Alison: What? Company? Who? ",
        "Rafe: Well, that's the real surprise. ",
        "Alison: Well, give me a hint and -- a big hint, a good one. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok. ",
        "Alison: Who? ",
        "Rafe: All right, here it is. Tonight in our special place, where all good \r\ndreams come true -- ",

        "Chris: I'll tell you, for a psychologist, your anger-management skills need a \r\nlot of work. ",
        "Eve: What's your problem, Amy? ",
        "Amy: I need to talk to you in private, Ian, please. ",
        "Ian: Ok, you and me in private. We won't be long. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. I'll bet. ",
        "Chris: Bet you 100 bucks she figures another way to worm out of this one, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Eve: I don't think so, Ramsey, not this time. ",
        "",
        "Amy: I didn't know what else I could do, Ian. I couldn't let Chris just show \r\nanybody that photograph. ",
        "Ian: So Eve was right. You broke into our loft. ",
        "Amy: I didn't have a choice. I had to get that picture back of me and my \r\nfather. I can't explain everything now, so please don't ask. But my father is \r\nthe reason why I'm running, ok? ",
        "Ian: No, it's not ok. You scared my wife half to death. ",
        "Amy: And if you don't help me stop Chris Ramsey from spreading that picture \r\naround, it could happen to all of us. He's going to get me and everybody close \r\nto me killed. ",

        "Kevin: Paige -- ",
        "Paige: Don't, Kevin, please. I shouldn't have said what I said. I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No, it's just that I could tell you you can stay in this room as long \r\nas you want, but if I did, you wouldn't be able to complete your journey, would \r\nyou? ",
        "Paige: No, I wouldn't. And I would have missed out on my second chance. Look, \r\nI know I don't belong here. I know this isn't my place. It's just that the \r\nmoments that I've spent here with Christina and with you have been so rich and \r\nso full of beautiful moments, I just -- God, I mean, letting go of it, it's just \r\n-- God, it hurts so much. ",
        "Kevin: But letting go doesn't mean you'll forget. ",
        "Paige: I know. I never will. But it's just that -- I mean, all I have is \r\nmemories. That's all I have. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if there's anyone I know who knows the power of memories, I \r\nmean, more than anyone -- Paige, there will be lots of wonderful things waiting \r\nfor you once we get to London and hang your portrait next to your ancestors in \r\nthe home that was home to your family for generations. ",
        "Paige: Thank you, Kevin. God, I pray that you're right and that Lucy's right \r\nand that somehow, somewhere there is someone else that I'm connected to in this \r\nworld, although I don't understand how that can be. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I've learned that nothing's impossible and miracles do happen, \r\nand life is full of surprises. ",
        "Paige: Not my life. At least not the first time around. Except when we were \r\nyoung and I was with you. Then and now, the time that I've spent with you here \r\nare the only two times in my life when -- I mean, God I know it sounds really \r\nfunny coming from me, being an angel, but the only times that I've really felt \r\nalive -- ",
        "Kevin: I think you're wrong. I think you're wrong about this place not being \r\nyour place. Paige, I'll never walk into this room again or even pick up a \r\npaintbrush without thinking of you and remembering all the time we had. Not just \r\nhere but long ago. ",
        "Paige: You are the greatest of all blessings, then and now. Always remember \r\nthat and the best of me. ",
        "Kevin: Well, there's only one thing left to do. Are you ready for that? ",
        "Paige: If it's with you, Kevin, I'm ready for anything. ",

        "Chris: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Ian: Lambert? ",
        "Chris: Well, it's about time. Hope you have a clearer picture now than the \r\none we have here. ",
        "Eve: So what's going on? ",
        "Amy: Go on, Ian. ",
        "Ian: The more we keep snooping around in her business, the more we're going \r\nto put her in danger. ",
        "Eve: Why? ",
        "Chris: What kind of danger? ",
        "Ian: She's running. She's in the Witness Protection Program. Before you say \r\nthat you don't believe me, know that I met the man who's in charge of it. ",
        "Eve: Whoa. Well, wait a minute. When? ",
        "Ian: A couple of weeks ago. The reason I didn't tell you about it -- ",
        "Amy: Because he wanted to keep you all safe, every one of you. ",
        "Eve: So that's why you lied about your past and your family when you first \r\ncame to town? ",
        "Amy: Yes. That's it's the only way I could be sure that I would be safe. ",
        "Chris: We're supposed to just believe this? ",
        "Ian: Yes, we are, Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Well, if it's true, Amy, I'm sorry. I mean, I wish you would have told \r\nme. I could have -- ",
        "Amy: What, Chris? You could have done what? You could have sold me to the \r\nhighest bidder? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, why would she trust you? You're like a damn truffle pig around --\r\n",
        "Eve: Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's enough, that's enough. ",
        "Amy: Please, stop, please. Look, we've all just had enough for one night. The \r\nsooner we drop the subject, the better. ",
        "Eve: Amy, I guess I owe you an apology. ",
        "Amy: Eve, you are way behind me on this score. I'm sorry for scaring you, but \r\nI hope now you understand. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Subject closed. We just need the disc. ",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. What do you want me to do with this? I mean -- ",
        "Ian: It's done, Ramsey. It's taken care of. ",

        "Rafe: Both of them -- they should be here by now, and don't you ask, no. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no, but it would be a lot easier for me to help you if I knew who \r\nthey were. ",
        "Rafe: No, no. Forget it, huh? ",
        "Alison: But I'm starving. Please, I just want one -- ",
        "Rafe: What are you doing? No, no, no, no -- ",
        "Alison: Please! I'm going to eat it! ",
        "Rafe: No, no, not one bite until they walk through that door. Believe me, \r\nyou'll be thanking me, all right? ",
        "Alison: Yes. I'm sure. ",
        "Rafe: What's that sound? Ok, you know what? They might be out there. I'm \r\ngoing to go check. You -- you, beautiful, wait right here. ",
        "Alison: Yes, mmm, yes, of course! Be very careful, it's treacherous. \r\nGo on. Oh. Rafe Kovich. If you were not actually an angel, you would still be \r\nmy angel just because everything you do is a little miracle. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Alison: Rafe Kovich's phone. This is -- hi. How did you get this number? Oh, \r\nI -- oh. Right. No, I -- I understand. No, that's ok. Yeah, you be sure and tell \r\nthem I say hi, and I'll talk -- to you later. ",
        "Rafe: Well, false alarm. There's nobody out there. There's -- there's no -- \r\nAlison? ",
        "Alison: Rafe, I know what you did -- what you tried to do here -- and I \r\nreally love you for trying, but it just -- ",
        "Rafe: Oh, please, no, no. ",
        "Alison: They're not coming. My parents are not coming. ",
        "Rafe: I am so sorry. I was so sure. ",
        "Alison: No, it's ok. I know. I know. I know you meant well. It's the thought \r\nthat counts, but, Rafe, they really don't -- they don't have time. They never \r\nhave. ",
        "Rafe: I just talked to your father. He promised me -- ",
        "Alison: I know. I'm sure he did. And had I known that that's what we were \r\nwaiting for, I would have just spared us the time. Rafe, my parents promise all \r\nkinds of things. They don't come through on them. ",
        "Rafe: Well, why? Why do they do that to you? ",
        "Alison: You know what? Listen, it's ok. Just forget about it, ok? Just forget \r\nabout it. Don't think about them. Hey, don't make me think about them, not here. \r\nOk, not in this place that is so special for the both of us that you've worked \r\nso hard on to really make a loving place for both of us, ok? There's much more \r\nimportant things to think about. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, all the promises we made to each other right here, huh? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. And out of all of those promises, there's one that you \r\nhaven't quite come through on for me. ",
        "Rafe: I haven't? What do you mean? What? What? What? ",
        "Alison: See, we're man and wife now, or sort of man, sort of wife. See, we're \r\nmarried now, and -- ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Before God and each other, and that's all that matters, right?\r\n",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. But when people have a marriage, when \r\nthey have a wedding, there's one thing that they do before the celebration \r\nactually begins, and that's the first dance. ",
        "Rafe: So that's the promise that I haven't come through on yet? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. So to make it officially unofficial, there's this one little \r\nthing, ok? ",
        "[Music plays] ",
        "Alison: How about it? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Definitely. Are you sure you're ok? ",
