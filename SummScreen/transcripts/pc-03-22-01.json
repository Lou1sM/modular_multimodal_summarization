        "Alison: This really bothers you, doesn't it? ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Alison: You know, Jack and \"Leather Slut.\" ",
        "Livvie: Hmm. I could not care less about that. Hanging out with some kind of \r\nmotorcycle mama seems to make sense for a guy like Jack. And he's going to have \r\nmore in common with her than he's ever had with me. ",
        "Alison: Look, Livvie, why don't you tell me another bedtime story I can \r\nbelieve, all right? Look, I saw you guys getting all cozy again, remember? The \r\nopening at the bike shop? ",
        "Livvie: You know what? It does not matter now, so -- ",
        "Alison: Oh, it doesn't? ",
        "Livvie: Not to Jack. He seems to think that every time -- ",
        "Alison: Ow! Ow! ",
        "Livvie: We start getting close, I put up some kind of a wall. ",
        "Alison: Well, do you? ",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe if I do, I've got a really good reason for it. Maybe I am \r\njust trying to keep Jack from being a part of my life for my own good. ",

        "Sam: Recover from our ride yet, Jackie boy? ",
        "Jack: Hey, Sam, how you doing? ",
        "Sam: Hey. Ready for another spin whenever you are. ",
        "Jack: Well, it looks like you've already got company. ",
        "Sam: Who, them? Potential customers. I told them about your shop and they \r\nwanted to check it out. ",
        "Man: Not bad. ",
        "Jamal: Check it out. ",
        "Jack: Sam, this is my buddy, Jamal. He kind of runs this whole joint. ",
        "Man: Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Zach. ",
        "Sam: Hey, you two know each other? ",
        "Zach: It's been a long time, man. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, not long enough. What are you doing here? ",
        "Zach: Nothing, just sniffing around. Sam's part of my crew. She said \r\nsomething about a new shop in town. I heard the name, figured now how could \r\nthere be two Jamals into bikes around here? Glad you're back in the game. ",
        "Jamal: I'm not in the game. I'm in the repair business. ",
        "Zach: Oh, and everybody knows you're the fastest thing on wheels. Nobody just \r\nwalks away when they can race like that. Who are you kidding? ",

        "Chris: All right, all right, I'm coming! My -- ",
        "Eve: Well, it's about time. Out of my way, Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Oh, I see. You call, say you're looking for some action, and suddenly \r\nI'm supposed to -- we're just going to be buddies again, is that it? ",
        "Eve: Yep. Got ice? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, freezer. ",
        "Eve: Thank you. ",
        "Chris: Wait a minute. What makes you think that I'm just going to welcome you \r\nback with open arms? ",
        "Eve: Because it's been a long time since you've had a really, really good \r\nmartini. ",
        "Chris: Hey, what's going on? I mean, what are you doing? ",
        "Eve: Wrong question, Ramsey. The question should be, what are we doing? ",
        "Chris: Fine. What are we doing? ",
        "Eve: We are getting really drunk -- really, really drunk. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: Oh, wait. Here, let me do that for you. You sit, I'll bring you your \r\ndrink, and some food if you're hungry. ",
        "Ian: I'm not hungry, and I pour my own whiskey. Ahem. ",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy. ",
        "Ian: What isn't easy, Arianna? What is -- ",
        "Arianna: I hope you don't mind me talking to Eve. ",
        "Ian: I -- I'd rather not talk about that, all right? You know, I -- I don't \r\nwant to talk at all. Is that ok? ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Arianna: I'll get it. ",
        "Ian: I got it. I'm already up. ",
        "Marika: Good evening, doctor. ",
        "Ian: Well, well, well. Here I thought with a new president, maybe you'd get \r\nthe evening off. ",
        "Marika: This isn't a bad time, is it? ",
        "Ian: Matter of fact, we've both had a long day. Maybe we can do this some \r\nother time. ",
        "Marika: Uh -- sorry, but this can't wait. ",
        "Ian: What is it? ",
        "Marika: Because of professional documentation we've just received, it's all \r\nhere -- field reports, transportation records. ",
        "Ian: What's all this about? ",
        "Marika: You took a professional trip to a place called Tirama Island \r\nrecently. Is that correct? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. What of it? ",
        "Marika: You weren't engaged in professional business at all. From what I can \r\nsee there, you spent all of your time on that island with Eve Lambert. Isn't \r\nthat the case, doctor? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Here's to the times we used to destroy our brain cells eight nights a \r\nweek. ",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. To the bad old days. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. Yeah, to the days when everyone hated us and we hated them right \r\nback. ",
        "Chris: Ah, well, nothing's changed for me. I mean, you're the turncoat. \r\nYou're one of the good guys now. ",
        "Eve: Don't rub it in. Gosh -- you know, there's something to be said for not \r\ngiving a you-know-what about anybody else. I used to fight for what I wanted and \r\ntake it. And now, I'm just -- I -- ",
        "Chris: You take it. ",
        "Eve: Hey, I don't roll over for anyone. That's not my style. ",
        "Chris: Well, it never was -- of course, that's before Dr. Riverdance took a \r\nwife, right? And don't give me that look. Ok? I mean, isn't this the drink-fest \r\nin honor of the happy couple? ",
        "Eve: Congratulations. You win yourself a refill. You know, it wouldn't be so \r\nbad if -- if I didn't like her so much, you know, if I didn't understand where \r\nshe was coming from. We are in love with the same guy. ",
        "Chris: So? What, that makes you sisters? ",
        "Eve: No. I'm just saying that she went through hell to get here, you know? \r\nShe really -- she left her whole life behind -- ",
        "Chris: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: Everything she ever knew. ",
        "Chris: Ooh. How courageous. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Well, now she is as needy as she is brave. Ian is the only human \r\nbeing on the face of this earth that she trusts. And she's not going to let him \r\ngo. ",
        "Chris: Never fall in love, Eve. That's always been my advice. ",
        "Eve: You did. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but I learned my lesson. ",
        "Eve: Does that mean Livvie's safe? Oh, good. Whew. Aha. ",
        "Chris: I wouldn't go that far, but I -- look, I know you don't approve. ",
        "Eve: Bingo! ",
        "Chris: I'll live, and so will she. And she'll learn a lot of things along the \r\nway. ",
        "Eve: And she'll never break your heart. ",
        "Chris: Our minds come protected. But our hearts -- see, they need a hand. I \r\nkeep mine in a lock box, which keeps me from -- ",
        "Eve: Ending up just like me. ",
        "Chris: Exactly. ",
        "Eve: Ha. ",
        "Chris: Been there, done that. I'm never going back -- never, ever, ever. ",
        "Eve: Ah. ",
        "",
        "Ian: It seems to me like you don't have all the information. I was there on \r\nprofessional business. I've been treating the islanders for years. And, yes, Dr. \r\nLambert was there. But she wasn't there with me. ",
        "Marika: Is that right? ",
        "Ian: Eve was there on a holiday. And while she was there, a young child got \r\nvery sick. Now, the child's father happens to be a very good friend of mine, so \r\nhe called me to see if I could come out and help the boy. But by the time I got \r\nthere, Eve had taken care of it. ",
        "Marika: Convenient. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. I don't think \"convenient\" is the right word here because Eve got \r\nsick herself. It was touch and go for a while. But I can tell you this -- when I \r\ngot to the island, I didn't know that she was going to be there. ",
        "Marika: And you knew all about this. ",
        "Arianna: My husband and I don't keep any secrets. ",
        "Marika: Or travel together, Mrs. Thornhart? Why not go along? ",
        "Ian: And, what -- take a chance of you letting her back in the country? I \r\ndon't think so. ",
        "Marika: The last time you were asked a few questions about your wife, you \r\nweren't so smooth, doctor. ",
        "Ian: Why don't you ask me now. Ask me anything. ",
        "",
        "Marika: Is your wife a good cook? ",
        "Ian: She's all right. But I do all the cooking around here. I like for her to \r\nrelax. ",
        "Marika: And how does she relax? ",
        "Ian: She likes to go for walks. Likes animals and trees and things, you know?\r\n",
        "Marika: But she's from the city. ",
        "Ian: And for the first time in her life, she can walk around without being \r\nafraid. And maybe one day we can walk around without having INS agents \r\nlooking over our shoulder. But we still have a good time, don't we? Hey. We have \r\na scrapbook. We take pictures of everything. Let's see. Got pictures of the zoo \r\nand this little restaurant here and the park. ",
        "Marika: I don't see very many pictures of Arianna. ",
        "Ian: Well, she likes to take pictures more than be in them, which is funny \r\nbecause she looks like a runway model. ",
        "Arianna: Ian, please. ",
        "Ian: Am I embarrassing you? ",
        "Marika: I've heard plenty for one night. ",
        "Ian: Now, why don't you stay? Why don't you stay for dinner? I'd love to talk \r\nabout my wife all night if I can. ",
        "Marika: I think that's enough for now, doctor. ",
        "Ian: All right, then. Good night. I -- I'm sorry about earlier. It's been a \r\nlong day. ",
        "Marika: For me, too. You'll be hearing from me. ",
        "Arianna: Goodnight. ",
        "Marika: Goodnight. ",
        "Arianna: That was quite the performance. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, huh? ",
        "Arianna: I believed every word. Especially the part about Eve almost dying. \r\nOf course, I had no idea Eve was there. ",
        "Ian: Well, she was. Sorry. ",
        "Arianna: No, don't apologize, and especially after what you just did. You \r\nsaved my life again. ",
        "Ian: Oh, that's exaggerating it a bit, isn't it? ",
        "Arianna: Not much. I'm amazed. You learned so much about me in such a short \r\ntime. How? ",
        "Ian: It's easy with a crib sheet. ",
        "Arianna: A what? ",
        "Ian: Let me show you. They're note cards. I write things down here. There.\r\n",
        "Arianna: This is all about me -- things I like, don't like. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, after the last meeting with the INS, I thought maybe I should \r\nmemorize some stuff. ",
        "Arianna: Memorize? ",
        "Ian: This system got me through med school. You know, I make a list, \r\nalphabetize it, and then -- well, like here. You know, I talk about the foods \r\nyou like -- ",
        "Arianna: Oh, just stop! Please! God. ",
        "Ian: What? What is it now? ",
        "Arianna: I don't need a list! What you like, don't like -- I know by heart! \r\nYou need this paper to remind you of the color of my eyes. I'm -- I'm such a \r\nfool. God, I'm such a fool! ",

        "Zach: Come on, man. You're the best there was. In one race you'll make more \r\nthan you would in a month at just fixing these broken-down crates. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, you may be right. ",
        "Zach: Turn your back on a pocket full of presidents? Give me one reason. ",
        "Jamal: Ain't none of your business. Speaking of business, I got lots to do \r\naround here. ",

        "Jamal: Not old friends. See you. ",

        "Jamal: Just some people I used to know, man. Just leave it alone, Jack, will \r\nyou? ",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, I would, but my new best friend is best friends with them, so \r\nyou might want to clue me in. ",
        "Jamal: Look, here's your clue -- if that lady in leather's a friend of that \r\nbunch right there, you make a hard left and you don't look back. ",
        "Jack: Hey, Sam. My buddy here says that you might be some kind of trouble \r\nfrom the company you keep. Is that true? ",

        "Alison: And you think that Jack's going to hurt you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, he would if I gave him a chance to, so I'm choosing Chris. He's \r\nsomeone I really feel I can count on, and that is important to me. ",
        "Alison: Well, I'm not saying that that's not important, but if you think that \r\nit should be at the top of your list, then you're so wrong -- and so is choosing \r\na guy just because you think that he's not going to hurt you. ",
        "Livvie: You want to know something, Alison? I don't care what you think -- \r\nyou or anyone else. My dad tells me to follow my heart -- so do you -- and every \r\ntime I do, I just end up feeling so -- ",
        "Alison: What? ",

        "Chris: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: Really? But that must be tough -- I mean, not ever letting anyone know \r\nhow you feel. Livvie doesn't even know how you feel. I'll bet you haven't even \r\nshared your hopes and your dreams with her. ",
        "Chris: Oh, come on, why would I? ",
        "Eve: Hmm? ",
        "Chris: She'd have to stop singing my praises just to listen. ",
        "Eve: That's right, and then she'd find out that you had flaws, too. ",
