        "Frank: \"How come you're never there when anyone else is around? No one \r\nbelieves you exist.\" ",
        "Frank: \"This scares me.\" \"But you don't have to be afraid. I just want you to \r\nmeet my friend. She needs to know you're real.\" ",

        "Karen: I'm glad to see you, too. You haven't gotten rid of the computer yet.\r\n",
        "Frank: Not yet. See? There's a new message. Read it for yourself. You'll see \r\nI'm not crazy. ",
        "Karen: It's blank. There's nothing there. ",

        "Arianna: Yes. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Good. That's -- that's good. I'm -- I'm just a little curious after \r\neverything you said about not wanting to let go. ",
        "Arianna: I -- I guess I had to let go of a lot of things recently. You're \r\njust the last on a very long list. ",
        "Ian: Just know what you're getting in return -- the chance for freedom, the \r\nchance for a wonderful new life. ",
        "Arianna: And what you're getting is the woman you love. You're getting Eve.\r\n",

        "Chris: See, there's nothing wrong with us getting to know each other a little \r\nmore intimately after all these years. ",
        "Eve: Exactly. I am a woman with needs. ",
        "Chris: Which the good Irish doctor clearly isn't meeting. ",
        "Eve: He said that we'd be together always. ",
        "Chris: Oh, sweetie. Guys tend to say that. ",
        "Eve: I mean, what am I supposed to do? Wait around forever? ",
        "Chris: You have way too much self-respect for that. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. You know, I'm so tired of all this fate and \"being together \r\nthrough the years\" crud. You know, it's all just a bunch of heartache. It is.\r\n",
        "Chris: What have I been telling you all this time? Love isn't worth it, \r\nespecially when you can have so much fun simply being friends. ",

        "Kevin: Like my moves, huh? ",
        "Lucy: I love your moves. I've always loved your moves. But this -- you outdid \r\nyourself. What prompted you? ",
        "Kevin: What prompted me to take my biker babe for a ride? ",
        "Lucy: No, to buy a motorcycle. ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. I guess I figured you shouldn't be the only \r\nunpredictable one in the family. ",
        "Lucy: You just called us a family. ",
        "Kevin: Ah! Well, I guess we are -- you and Serena, me and Livvie. Kind of \r\nlike a family. ",
        "Lucy: Except for Livvie. She's still very angry, I think. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I had a talk with her, and I think we worked it out. ",
        "Lucy: She actually forgave you for lying to her about me and -- ",
        "Kevin: Jack? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I think she did. ",
        "Lucy: I am so relieved. I cannot tell you how relieved I am that she -- and \r\nhappy. Really, I am very, very happy for you and for Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. I'm pretty happy about it myself. ",
        "Lucy: She just didn't happen to maybe mention, you know, somebody else she \r\nmight be interested in forgiving, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Didn't mention you once. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: But she did bring up Jack. ",
        "Lucy: She did? What did she say? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I think she's about this close to taking him back, and I didn't \r\neven try to talk her out of it, as much as I wanted to. ",
        "Lucy: See? Along with that motorcycle, you are making karmic progress. ",
        "Kevin: Then why do I have such a bad feeling about it? ",
        "Lucy: Because you're her dad and dads are supposed to worry. I mean, you're \r\nher father. It's ok. But you know what? I really believe that Jack's going to \r\nsurprise you. ",
        "Kevin: That's what I'm afraid of. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, come on. He has a good soul, you know, underneath that cocky little \r\nsmile and that misdirectional haircut, you know? He's ok. He's going to be ok.\r\n",

        "Ian: I know this is hard on you, but you're a beautiful young woman and you \r\nhave your whole life. ",
        "Arianna: That's what I said to Eve. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Arianna: I told Eve that she was beautiful, smart, and funny and that she \r\ncould get any man she wanted -- except you. ",
        "Ian: Why would you say that? ",
        "Arianna: Because I knew how committed you were to me. ",
        "Ian: Committed, yes. ",
        "Arianna: But not in love. ",
        "Ian: Funny thing about love, Arianna. When it happens to you -- and it will \r\n-- there will be no trying involved. All you'll have to do is sit back, love, be \r\nloved. Arianna, come on. ",
        "Arianna: No, I -- ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "Arianna: Oh, I am sorry for all the troubles I've caused. ",

        "Livvie: Yeah, I -- I needed someone to talk to. It's kind of been a rough \r\nweek. ",
        "Chris: I'm sorry to hear that. ",
        "Livvie: Thanks. What took you so long to answer the door? ",
        "Chris: Oh, a patient. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, a patient at home? ",
        "Chris: No, not at home. Of course not. It's on the phone. It's a serious \r\ncondition. It's heart trouble. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, I'm sorry. But, look, if it's ok, I'll just wait because I could \r\nreally use a friend right now. ",

        "Livvie: Your patient? The phone? ",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, we're finished. We're not finished. I mean, I have \r\nto call her back. Her -- you know, Mrs. Martini. Look, you know, I'm really \r\nsorry. I'm so preoccupied with this, it's -- can we do this later? ",
        "Livvie: What do you say we meet at the recovery room in, like, a half an \r\nhour? ",
        "Chris: Um -- you know, I'm probably going to need about an hour, hour and a \r\nhalf, and then I'll -- I'll be all set. How about I see you there? ",
        "Livvie: You really give me something to look up to. I just hope I'm as \r\ndedicated as you are when I'm a resident. ",
