        "Kevin uses blackmail to try to force Lucy to go back to him. He's prepared to make her lose custody of Christina over her belief in vampires. Christina tugs at Lucy's heartstrings. Rafe tells Alison of his reluctant promise to kill the last remaining vampire, which will likely be Ian. After going off alone to drink the blood that Lucy brought him, Ian returns to the healing pool. The first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" begin to play as he submerges himself in the water. Rafe runs from the Recovery Room when he senses that something is wrong. Alison tries to follow, but a fanged Reese stops her. Caleb tells Tess that he was wrong to separate her from Livvie. He would do anything to have his Olivia back as a whole person. Tess and Livvie merge into one person. Livvie tells Caleb that all he had to do was want all of her instead of only part of her. Caleb believes that nothing can stop them now."

        "Rafe: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey, there you are.",
        "Rafe: You're still here.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I mean, I wanted to talk to you. I thought you said you were going to be right back.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, you know, things didn't go so well with Ian.",
        "Alison: Wait, what do you mean? What -- what -- Ian? What things? You didn't even tell me why you left so fast.",
        "Rafe: Yeah -- look, come here.",
        "Alison: What is it?",
        "Rafe: Sit down a second. See, I think I figured out why the hot spring didn't cure Ian the same way it did your mother.",
        "Alison: Good. Good",
        "Rafe: No, no, wait a second. Don't get too excited. See, the reason is that Ian has to feed. And since that's obviously not really an option for him --",
        "Alison: Wait -- so then he would be stuck being a vampire?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And see, that's not the worst of it because he's not going to be able to fight his instincts forever. Pretty soon he won't have a choice and he's just going to give in to them.",
        "Alison: Rafe, I don't understand. So if we -- if we cure all the other vampires, then --",
        "Rafe: Then this whole nightmare is just going to start all over again.",
        "Alison: So what's the answer?",
        "Rafe: Ian made me promise him that I would slay the last standing vampire in Port Charles.",
        "Alison: You mean --",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know, it's funny, I -- I spent so much of my life alone, I wouldn't even know what it was like to have a best friend. But I figured out today that I've got one. I've had one for a while now. I just might have to drive a stake through his heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: I pray you're right, Lucy. I pray this works.",
        "Lucy: Carmen, . . How's Christina? Did you tell her she has to eat those little carrot thingies whether she wants -- what do you mean, her daddy picked her up? It's not -- it's not Scott's night tonight. He knows -- Kevin picked -- what -- Kevin was there? Ok, ok. Yeah. Oh, my God. Ian!",
        "Lucy: Ian!",
        "Ian: Leave me alone.",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ian: Leave me alone, please.",
        "Lucy: I need to --",
        "Ian: Leave me, Lucy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin and Christina: Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream",
        "Kevin: You know all the words. That's really good.",
        "Christina: This is fun, daddy.",
        "Kevin: Oh, just wait till your mommy gets here. That's when the fun really begins.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: What mistake?",
        "Caleb: I was wrong to try to create you from Livvie and to pull you two apart the way I did.",
        "Tess: You don't want me anymore.",
        "Caleb: Oh, no. No, I do want you. But I want you the way you were before, the way you were when we first met. I want Olivia. I want her to be whole again.",
        "Tess: No. No, I'm sorry, that's not going happen. It's never -- it's never going to happen. Not ever.",
        "Caleb: Please try and understand.",
        "Tess: No, I don't understand. You think you can just snap your fingers and have everything go back to the way it was? That's impossible. What's done is done. I'm my own person now.",
        "Caleb: I know you are.",
        "Tess: And I'm a good person. People love me. You love me -- at least, I thought you did.",
        "Caleb: I do love you. You gave me back the best part of me.",
        "Tess: I restored your soul. But you're scared. You turned your back on the dark side, and that frightens you.",
        "Caleb: Tess --",
        "Tess: Oh, my God. You don't have to worry, Caleb. I don't blame you for being afraid. This is all so new to you. You're looking at the world with completely different eyes now, and that must be so terrifying. But don't worry. I'm here, and we'll get through this together. Little by little, you'll be able to accept the man that you've become and even embrace him. But you --",
        "Caleb: Tess --",
        "Tess: You don't have to erase me, Caleb. Please --",
        "Caleb: Tess, shut up! Listen to me. Listen to me. I do love you. I love you. It's because of that love, it's because of what you've taught me and what you've shown me about myself that I have to make this decision.",
        "Tess: What decision?",
        "Caleb: I -- I tried to change Livvie into something that she wasn't. And then she tried to destroy me. You're trying to change me into something I'm not, something that I don't want. Her soul was this dark thing, and yours is pure light. But it's the two of you together that I am in love with.",
        "Tess: You do want to erase me. I'm not good enough for you.",
        "Caleb: That's not true. I'm trying to restore you to your best self. That's what you did for me.",
        "Tess: But I -- I thought -- I hoped --",
        "Caleb: I never meant to hurt you, Tess. I know that seems hard to believe right now. All I'm trying to do is do what's best for all of us.",
        "Tess: What's best for all of us is if you would have left me alone in the first place. Why did you have to do this to us? Why couldn't you just leave us alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Lucy? Look at that, probably scared her off. Just as well. I got to do this alone.",
        "Lucy: Oh! Hey, sweet pea.",
        "Christina: Hi, mommy.",
        "Lucy: Hi. How are you? Are you ok?",
        "Christina: Uh-huh.",
        "Lucy: You are?",
        "Kevin: Hey, look who's here, just in time. Hot cocoa?",
        "Lucy: Uh -- no, thank you. No hot cocoa for us. We're just going to be leaving.",
        "Kevin: No. You just got here.",
        "Lucy: What do you want?",
        "Kevin: Honey, why don't you go and finish our surprise for mommy, ok?",
        "Christina: Ok, daddy. Wait till you see, mommy.",
        "Lucy: How dare you. How dare you involve Christina in all of this.",
        "Kevin: In what?",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, just tell me what it is you want. What sick game are you playing now?",
        "Kevin: A game. A game, a game, a game, a game. Today? Well, I guess we could call it truth or consequences.",
        "Lucy: Truth in what?",
        "Kevin: Well, I know the truth about Ian being a vampire. So, Lucy, I guess it's time for you to suffer some consequences.",
        "Lucy: I knew you were going to try and do something. I just wondered what took you so long.",
        "Kevin: Well, a good plan takes time, Lucy. You have to think these things through.",
        "Lucy: If you actually think I'm going to stand here and listen to your psychotic ramblings, you're crazier than I thought. I'm going to go get Christina, and I'm leaving.",
        "Kevin: No, you're not going anywhere, Lucy. If you want Christina back, you'll leave your feet right where they are a listen to what I have to say.",
        "Lucy: You know no court in the world would ever give you custody.",
        "Kevin: Who says I'd ask for it? But that's not to say that you wouldn't lose her.",
        "Lucy: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Kevin: Do I have to paint you a picture? Self-proclaimed slayer? Mistress to a real, live vampire? I don't know a court in the world that wouldn't find you unfit.",
        "Lucy: Why are you doing this?",
        "Kevin: You're really going to ask me that? I guess I have to take a trip down memory lane. Or can I just sum it up by reminding you how you've turned your back on me? How you've humiliated me?",
        "Lucy: You did that to yourself!",
        "Kevin: I lost everything, Lucy! My wife, my kids, my job.",
        "Lucy: That's not my fault.",
        "Kevin: It's precisely your fault. You did this to me, Lucy, and now you're going to help me put it all back together again. And I refuse to be the one who keeps losing time and time again.",
        "Lucy: Well, I -- I refuse to stand here and listen to your stupid, empty threats.",
        "Kevin: Empty threats?",
        "Kevin: Have a listen.",
        "Lucy's voice: Ok, all right, so we've got it. We found Caleb's secret stash. What does that mean? What do we do with this now?",
        "Rafe's voice: Legend says that this water was used to heal. It almost made people feel reborn.",
        "Lucy's voice: Ok, so what --",
        "Rafe's voice: So, Caleb -- he made a special cocktail out of it, using Chris' special formula to hide the vampire --",
        "Lucy: That's enough. That's enough! Turn it off.",
        "[Kevin stops tape]",
        "Kevin: I wonder what a judge would think about a mother who believes in vampires and magic pools that heal them.",
        "Lucy: I could explain all that.",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm sure you could. But how do you explain these? Yeah, that's a little bit tougher, isn't it, Lucy? I mean, come on, let's face it. You got caught red-handed -- no pun intended -- stealing blood from a hospital. Now, don't look so glum. You don't have to lose Christina. There is another option.",
        "Lucy: What? What's another option?",
        "Kevin: Now I have your attention. Have a seat.",
        "Lucy: What -- what is it that you want?",
        "Kevin: Well, it's simple, really. You come back to me as my wife -- and I mean my wife in every sense of the word -- or I will make sure that you never get near your children again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: No, I mean, there's got to be some other way to this, then.",
        "Rafe: I wish I could find it.",
        "Alison: I mean, it's horrible enough just even thinking about losing Ian. I mean, he's sort of like a part of our family. But then to think that maybe you would be the one to -- no. I mean, this has got to be killing you.",
        "Rafe: I don't know. The slayer in me knows that it's the only way to end this once and for all.",
        "Alison: Well, what about the other part of you, the friend part?",
        "Rafe: Is not even sure if I can do it. I mean, you know, I was trained to fight evil, and Ian, despite what he's become --",
        "Alison: He's still a really good person. I mean, he's got his heart.",
        "Rafe: Right, but I -- I promised him. You know, he's counting on me to come through for him. I promised him I would do it, and that's the only thing that's keeping him going right now, and -- oh, this is stupid. I'm feeling sorry for myself, and he's the one going through hell.",
        "Alison: Has anybody even told Lucy?",
        "Rafe: Nope.",
        "Alison: Rafe, this will destroy her.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it. Damn it! I mean, I finally have an answer. I finally figured out a way that I can get rid of these bloodsucking monsters, and I can't save the one who still has a soul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Ok. This is it. I've done all I can. So, please, God, let this cure work for me. I want to be a good father to my son. I want to have a life with Lucy. I'm going to keep fighting, and this way we can be a family again. All right? Whatever happens, make sure they know how much I love them.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: How, Caleb? How can you -- how can you do this? You created a person, a separate identity with a heart and feelings and thoughts of her own. You can't change your mind as if I were nothing. It's too late. Especially after everything we've been through, after you've held me in your arms and you've -- and you've made love to me. How can you look me in the eyes and tell me I'm a mistake?",
        "Caleb: You are not a mistake. It was my mistake to try to divide you. You were wonderful when you were whole. That's what I want back again.",
        "Tess: What you want is to make me disappear.",
        "Caleb: No. What I want is for you to let Livvie back in because I love you both, both parts of you, and they belong together.",
        "Tess: I can't help you.",
        "Caleb: I need you to help me. Because I can't reach Livvie anymore. The Livvie that I first met. And I would give anything to have her back. Anything.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Caleb: Tess. Hey. Hey.",
        "Livvie: Caleb. Oh --",
        "Caleb: Oh, my God, it's you.",
        "Livvie: You did it, my love. All you had to do was want all of me. You just had to ask. And not for the Livvie you stripped of all conscience and not for your Olivia and not for Tess, who wouldn't let you be who you are. You had to ask for the real person -- the good, the bad, the selfish, the whole person.",
        "Caleb: Olivia. My Olivia. I finally have you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: It's time to come home, Lucy. It's time to leave Ian and come home and be a wife to your husband.",
        "Lucy: Never.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Say goodbye to motherhood. It was fun while it lasted, though, wasn't it?",
        "Lucy: You really are a heartless son of a bitch.",
        "Kevin: Hey. I brought Christina back to you. I can take her away again. But on the bright side, it's your call. Hey.",
        "Christina: All done, daddy. Just seal it with a kiss.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Christina: Open it, Mommy. Me and daddy made it for you.",
        "Kevin: That's right. We sure did, didn't we? Ooh.",
        "Christina: Daddy says we're going to be a family again.",
        "Kevin: You bet we are.",
        "Christina: Did you tell Ian yet, Mommy? Did you?",

        "Alison: Hey, do you want to maybe get out of here? Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Huh?",
        "Alison: What is it? Is there something else wrong?",
        "Rafe: I don't know.",
        "Alison: What do you mean, you don't know?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. Something's off. Something feels different.",
        "Alison: What feels different? What is it?",
        "Rafe: Just -- wait here, ok?",
        "Alison: What? Rafe -- wait. Rafe!",
        "Reese: Going somewhere, goldilocks?",
        "Alison: Reese.",
