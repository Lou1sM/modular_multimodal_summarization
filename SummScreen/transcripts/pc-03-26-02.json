        "Amy: When I was given the chance to return to earth, to experience love \r\nagain, I wanted a man that I respected, a man that would sweep me off my feet. \r\nThat man is you, Ian. ",

        "Casey: Can I at least just come in? ",

        "Ricky: Yeah. Ever since you've known me, you nearly got killed. ",
        "Casey: It's not a problem. No, see -- I've just never found it easy to, you \r\nknow, trust people. And I've never let myself, you know, care about anyone. At \r\nleast not till I met you. I kind of hide behind this tough-girl stuff sometimes \r\njust a little, you know, kind of. ",
        "Ricky: I noticed. ",
        "Casey: You caught me off guard, man. You touched me, made me laugh, made me \r\nfeel safe and excited at the same time. And at first, you drove me crazy because \r\nyou knew me so well. And then I thought -- I thought and I loved it. You totally \r\nturned my life upside down and it scared me. ",
        "Ricky: I know what that's like. ",
        "Casey: You do? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I used to have a pretty good act, too. You know, flash a big \r\nsmile, tell a joke. Charm them and then con them. I was never like my sister -- \r\nsmart. Or a big hero like my brother. But, hey, I was charming. I mean, why do \r\nyou think Amanda Barrington hired me and gave me a job, which I probably lost by \r\nnow because who wants a chauffeur that looks like Frankenstein? ",
        "Casey: Hey, it's not your face that's gotten you through life, Ricky. It's \r\nyou. ",

        "Amy: I always wondered what love would be like. Would it sneak up on me? \r\nWould it shake me, would it change me, would it make me feel complete? I have \r\nall these questions. ",
        "Ian: You know I'm not the answer. ",
        "Amy: Well, don't think of it as betraying your wife. Think of it as you \r\ngranting a wish to a dying friend, a friend that you care about, a friend that \r\nyou're never going to see again. I know that you are a kind and generous man.\r\n",
