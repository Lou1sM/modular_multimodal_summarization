        "Alison gets away from Reese, who catches up with her at the apartment. Ian informs Rafe that the healing pool failed him again. Rafe believes that they have to proceed with the plan now, because Caleb's power is becoming stronger. Lucy threatens Kevin with a knife, but he talks her into putting it down. She agrees to pack, explain things to Ian, and return the next day. Despite his assurances that he loves Lucy, Kevin is fascinated with the knife and the idea of \"till death do us part.\" Reese tries to bite Alison but can't. Alison stops Rafe from staking Reese. Ian gives Lucy the bad news, but Lucy doesn't tell him what happened with Kevin. After Caleb and Livvie repeat their wedding vows, he takes her to the villa. When she urges him to bite her, Caleb prepares to honor her request."

        "Alison: Reese.",
        "Reese: You should have worried a little less about Jack and a bit more for your own safety.",
        "Alison: You need to stay away from me.",
        "Reese: Or what are you going whine and cry --",
        "Alison: I'm warning you.",
        "Reese: All you want, little girl, but as soon I sink my teeth into that scrawny little neck -- round one to the princess, but the fun is just beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Hello? Someone's here. I can feel it. Something's changed. I just --",
        "Rafe: The battery's dead. This must have been on before. No. Ian! Come on, man! Ian! What are you doing? What the hell are you doing?",
        "Ian: What do you think I'm doing? I thought I could be cured now that --",
        "Rafe: What? What?",
        "Ian: I drank human blood! Lucy got it for me. I drank it, I came here, played that stupid song, jumped in here --",
        "Rafe: Nothing?",
        "Ian: No. I'm still a damn vampire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: She finally fell asleep.",
        "Kevin: Good.",
        "Lucy: How can you do this? How can you be so cruel?",
        "Kevin: Cruel? Did you see the smile on Christina's face?",
        "Lucy: Because you lied to her. You lied to her and told her we were going to be a family again.",
        "Kevin: I love her, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Don't say that. Don't say that.",
        "Kevin: Don't tell me how I feel. And I got her mama home to stay, didn't I?",
        "Lucy: Home? Home to what?",
        "Kevin: Our family. Nothing has to change.",
        "Lucy: Everything has changed. We are not a family. This is not a home. This has become some sort of prison.",
        "Kevin: Well, you're the one making it a prison, Lucy. Look around. Look, this is your home, and I am your husband.",
        "Lucy: Why would you even want me when I cannot stand the sight of you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Will you look at me, Caleb? Look into my eyes and never look away.",
        "Caleb: Never again.",
        "Livvie: Do you know how it makes me feel when you look at me that way?",
        "Caleb: Warm. Inviting. Inviting me in.",
        "Livvie: Please. Don't ever let us part again.",
        "Caleb: From this moment on, beyond all powers of life and death, all forces seen and unseen, my love, I take you.",
        "Livvie: And I take you, my love, my darkest heart forever.",
        "Caleb: You remember the words.",
        "Livvie: I remember, my love.",
        "Caleb: Bound through the ages to each other --",
        "Livvie: Of our own free will.",
        "Caleb: In a compact eternal. Keepers and guardians of each other's flesh and bone.",
        "Livvie: Ever on.",
        "Caleb: Ever on. For now and all time, we are --",
        "Livvie: Complete.",
        "Caleb: At last, it begins.",
        "Livvie: Here where I gave my body and blood to you.",
        "Caleb: Here in our private world.",
        "Caleb: I want to devour you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Damn!",
        "Rafe: All right, easy, all right?",
        "Ian: That's what we thought, right? Drink some blood, go for a swim, and everything's back to normal.",
        "Rafe: No, come on, let's go.",
        "Ian: That's what we believed -- this could happen.",
        "Rafe: Maybe we just need to be doing something different.",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Rafe: Think about this is a different way.",
        "Ian: No, I can't just drink blood. I have to feed on someone.",
        "Rafe: Yes, yes, you do.",
        "Ian: Well, I'm never going to do that.",
        "Rafe: All right, fine! Ok. So let's just do what we have to do, all right, what we know we can do.",
        "Ian: We'll make Caleb and all his little friends -- have them go for a swim, and they'll be healed.",
        "Rafe: All right. We're going to have to do that now. I feel somehow his power's grown stronger.",
        "Ian: Well, we can, we will. When it's all said and done --",
        "Rafe: No, don't say it. I know what you want me to do.",
        "Ian: As far as we both know, I'm the only vampire that didn't feed, and that means I can't be cured.",
        "Rafe: I know, but --",
        "Ian: You can and you will. You have a job to do, slayer.",
        "Rafe: Ian --",
        "Ian: You promised me! When it's time, you will kill the last vampire standing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Now you can't stand the sight of me.",
        "Lucy: What do you expect? You kidnap me, you tried to kill me, and now you're doing this?",
        "Kevin: And here you are in my living room.",
        "Lucy: Because you're holding Christina hostage.",
        "Kevin: You know I'd never hurt her. I think you're just using Christina as a way to get back into my life.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. You are crazier than I thought!",
        "Kevin: Look at the passion in your eyes. You're trying so hard to hate, but you can't.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, um -- I -- I think maybe you're right. Maybe I'm a little confused and I need to rethink this, so I need to go and think. I need to take Christina and leave --",
        "Kevin: Oh, no, no, no, you'd wake her up. I don't think you should do that.",
        "Lucy: I'm -- I'm sorry for what I said. I need to leave --",
        "Kevin: You don't have to apologize, Lucy. You see, that's just it. I'm not -- I don't blame you. I blame him.",
        "Lucy: Don't do that. You leave Ian out of this.",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm happy to do that. You see, all I'm asking is for you to give us some time with no other voices, no interference. And then we can be --",
        "[Lucy gasps]",
        "Kevin: Now that makes me sad. I'm trying so hard to be gentle and caring and be the man that you loved.",
        "Lucy: Kevin was the man that I loved, and he would never do this. He wouldn't hold me prisoner. He wouldn't hold me against my will like this.",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe I have changed. The old Kevin never knew how to fight hard enough, not when it came to people he loved. But the new Kevin does, and that's exactly what I'm doing, Lucy. I'm fighting.",
        "Lucy: Well, then you're going to force me to have to fight back, because blackmail is not love.",
        "Kevin: I'm just keeping the promises that I made to my wife and my daughter.",
        "Lucy: Don't come any closer to me.",
        "Kevin: Come on, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: No! Just don't. I'm done. Don't force me to do this, please.",
        "Kevin: Well, then do it. Do it. Straight through the heart, Lucy. You might as well. And then when I'm dead, and they take you away, and Christina's in a foster home -- will you feel better?",
        "Lucy: No, I would be sick -- sick that it's come to this.",
        "Kevin: No more than I. I brought Christina back for us to be a family, Lucy. Don't tear that apart.",
        "Lucy: That would be very wrong, wouldn't it?",
        "Kevin: Unfair. But there's still the problem of you living with a vampire, and it's awfully hard to get custody under those circumstances. Now, why don't you put that down so you can give this some thought?",
        "Lucy: What about Christina? What happens to her?",
        "Kevin: She'll stay here with me, of course.",
        "Lucy: Oh, she'd live here alone with you?",
        "Kevin: You're welcome to stay with us. You, me, Christina -- try again.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "Kevin: You have to make him understand. Ian. You need to make him understand that you want what's best for our family.",
        "Lucy: Right. Right, I'd have to do that. He'd never understand if I leave and if I didn't make him see that I need to do this.",
        "Kevin: Want to do this.",
        "Lucy: Want -- because I don't want to uproot Christina again. She's been through so much.",
        "Kevin: Exactly. So, you see, it's worth giving it another try.",
        "Lucy: Christina's very important --",
        "Kevin: To both of us.",
        "Lucy: And she would be safe with you here tonight?",
        "Kevin: That hurts. That's a line I would never cross, and you know that.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Then you love me, and you want this -- us to be all together?",
        "Kevin: With all my heart. That's never changed.",
        "Lucy: So Christina will be safe here tonight. Then I will come back tomorrow.",
        "Kevin: To stay.",
        "Lucy: I'm -- I need to go pack a few things.",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- I'm glad we've finally come to an understanding about this. I know we can make this work. So, you go pack. Christina and I will be waiting for you to come back.",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Kevin: Till death do us part.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, so this is what we're going to do -- we're going to get the vampires to take care of business, and then we'll start looking for other ways to take care of you.",
        "Ian: There are no other ways. What if I can't control these urges?",
        "Rafe: You don't know that. You don't know what's going to happen.",
        "Ian: Yes, I do.",
        "Rafe: All right, then you know what? Call me.",
        "Ian: I'll call you. What if I hurt someone? What if I kill somebody?",
        "Rafe: Ok, just look, hold on a second, ok? Everybody -- everybody's got these \"what ifs\" in their lives. We can't live like that.",
        "Ian: That's right. So I'm asking you as a friend.",
        "Rafe: Asking me as a friend. This is great. So you really want to do this?",
        "Ian: Choose how I live my life or not live my life? You bet I do.",
        "Rafe: I can understand that.",
        "Ian: It's going to be up to you to explain to Lucy, you know, try to make her understand.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry, but I don't think she will ever understand.",
        "Ian: I know. I really do love her more than life itself. Nothing left to say, is there?",
        "Rafe: Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Olivia?",
        "Livvie: Here I am.",
        "Caleb: Come to me.",
        "Livvie: Find me.",
        "Caleb: I'll always find you.",
        "Livvie: That felt so good.",
        "Livvie: But it's not enough. I want to feel your lips against mine again.",
        "Caleb: And what else do you want?",
        "Livvie: Your warm breath on my neck.",
        "Caleb: The taste of your sweetness.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yes.",
        "Caleb: And our bodies touching close. You're finally home, my love.",
        "Livvie: To stay, this time.",
        "Caleb: Evermore. My Olivia. My reason. My song.",
        "Livvie: My love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Thank God I lost her. Finally safe and sound.",
        "Reese: Not quite.",
        "Alison: Oh, God.",
        "Reese: Well, I am your personal angel of death, and that's God-like enough. Welcome home, sweetie.",
        "Alison: Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Reese: Because you hurt my feelings, Alison. I'm very sensitive. You told me I was disgusting. You told me I wasn't worthy of being loved. Do you know how that feels? Never to have been loved? Never to have been worthy of love? Can you even imagine?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Reese: Well, you're about to find out. It's time for you to become one of us.",
        "Alison: Please, don't. Don't do this to me, please.",
        "Reese: Let's see how your slayer boyfriend feels when he can't even bear to look at you because you're as disgusting as I am.",
        "Alison: No. Rafe. No. No!",
        "Alison: No! Please don't do this to me.",
        "Reese: Shut up! Shut up! This time you can't stop me, Alison.",
        "Alison: No!",
        "Reese: What have you done to me? I'll kill you with my bare hands if I have to.",
        "Alison: No, please, don't. Rafe!",
        "Rafe: Alison!",
        "Alison: Rafe!",
        "Reese: Oh -- oh!",
        "Rafe: It's your time now, vampire. You're banished from this world.",
        "Alison: No, don't. Don't.",
        "Rafe: Alison, what are you doing?",
        "Alison: Rafe, don't. Just stop it. Please. Don't.",
        "Reese: You lose, slayer.",
        "Alison: Rafe --",
        "Rafe: What? What is it? Why'd you stop me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Ian: Hi.",
        "Lucy: You went to the hot springs without me, didn't you? It -- worked?",
        "Ian: I tried.",
        "Lucy: Oh.",
        "Ian: I drank the blood and I listened to the music and I jumped in the water, and I -- I --",
        "Lucy: Oh, God, I -- I have to -- I -- I have --",
        "Ian: You have to what?",
        "Lucy: God. God. God. I --",
        "Ian: It'll be all right. We'll be fine. We'll find another way.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, of course we will. You're right.",
        "Ian: What is it?",
        "Lucy: Nothing. I just -- I need you to hold me. We will -- we'll find another way, I know it. We'll -- we'll win in the end. We can win this.",
        "Ian: We'll just keep fighting.",
        "Lucy: You just keep holding me and not let go.",
        "Ian: I'll always be here.",

        "Caleb: I love you.",
        "Livvie: Then show me -- the sting and the sweetness as everything else drains away and I feel your life flood through my veins please. Let me be who you want me to be -- who I want to be. Let me take my place and make us complete.",
