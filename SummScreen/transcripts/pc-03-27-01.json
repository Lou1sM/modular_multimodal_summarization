        "Lucy: Oh, pooh! I can't believe we have to do without our beautiful chopper.\r\n",
        "Kevin: It's just a little diagnostic. It won't be long. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Kevin: Oh, ho, ho! You're hooked. ",
        "Lucy: I am. I really am. I love it! I love the whole feel of it. I love the \r\nwind in my hair and I love all of the places I can put my hands and arms around \r\nyou. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: But you know the best part? ",
        "Kevin: Not your hands and arms around me? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, that -- that's the best part. But the second best part is I get to \r\nbuy a whole new wardrobe. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, yes, of course, as if you need more leather. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I have a lot of leather, but, see, this -- this leather is my \r\nsophisticated leather. ",
        "Kevin: Of course it is. ",
        "Lucy: I mean -- yeah, it is, it is. Come on, look at this. This is gorgeous \r\nleather, but now I need sophisticated, biker-babe, hot-chick bike leather. ",
        "Kevin: Of course you do. ",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Kevin: What was I thinking? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. I am so glad Alison talked you into buying this bike. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I think Alison could talk anyone into anything. ",
        "Lucy: What? Does -- ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I just started thinking about Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Which means Chris Ramsey had to cross your mind. ",
        "Kevin: He's going to hurt her. He's going to hurt her, I just know it, and \r\nthere's nothing I can say to her because she just thinks I'm being an \r\noverprotective father. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you are, which you should be, but the problem with those girls \r\nthat age is they only listen to other girls their same age. ",
        "Kevin and Lucy: Alison. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Well, since you brought up Chris, you know, do I get to give you my \r\nopinion or are you going to bite my head off again? ",
        "Livvie: I did not come here for a lecture. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Well, I guess I got my answer. ",
        "Livvie: Alison, look, I told you why I wanted to be with Chris -- because I \r\nwant you to support me and stop putting him down. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, you can't just say, \"I'm going to be with this guy, you know. \r\nHe's my one and only.\" I mean, you've got to, like, feel it. Chemistry is really \r\nimportant. ",
        "Livvie: But he gets me. You know? He -- he understands me and that's what \r\nfeels good. ",
        "Alison: Not as good as chemistry. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I -- I have just been too distracted to appreciate him in that \r\nway. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, you have been, and that little distraction's called Jack, ok? \r\nHe's the one who makes your toes curl. ",
        "Livvie: I am going to see what I have with Chris -- for real, this time. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Kim? Hey, it's Dr. Ramsey. Listen, I want to step things up a little \r\nbit with Livvie -- you know, really get into her heart. So this is what I want \r\nyou to do -- poke around her room, see if you can find a diary. Yeah. Yeah, if \r\nyou do, just give me a call. Ok, thanks. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "[Chris growls] ",
        "Eve: Go ahead, Ramsey. Get it all out. Go on. Take your potshots. ",
        "Chris: Come on. You know I'd never kick you when you're down. Besides, I \r\nconsider you wanting to sleep with me a step up for you. ",
        "Eve: Please. You know that there is no way I would ever let that happen. ",
        "Chris: Hmm. Well, your loss. Don't spend all those lonely nights dreaming \r\nabout what might have been. ",
        "[Eve chuckles] ",
        "Eve: Thanks, but that won't be a problem. My nights are about to get a lot \r\ncozier. ",
        "",
        "Victor: Oh, I can understand why you're in such a hurry to get Arianna \r\nrelocated. ",
        "Ian: Well, Gabriela's pretty sure she convinced Ben that he's still wanted \r\nfor Joe's murder. ",
        "Victor: So he couldn't risk coming back here. ",
        "Ian: I didn't want to take a chance. ",
        "Victor: Well, considering everything you've told me about him, I think you're \r\nvery wise. What does Arianna say? ",
        "Ian: I haven't told her. ",
        "Victor: Why? ",
        "Ian: She's scared enough as it is. ",
        "Victor: Well, I understand -- ",
        "Ian: But I do have to tell her something. I don't know how she's going to \r\ntake leaving early. ",
        "Victor: Arianna. How very nice to see you. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Arianna: You, too. I got your message. What's going on? ",
        "Ian: Well, good news. Uh -- the things we're working on are working out \r\nbetter than we expected. ",
        "Arianna: What do you mean? ",
        "Ian: Well, the family you're going to be staying with is -- is ready for you \r\nnow. ",
        "Victor: They're very excited to hear that you're going to be staying with \r\nthem. ",
        "Ian: So, you're going to be leaving a little earlier than we thought. ",
        "",
        "Pilot: Mr. Shapour, we will be leaving for Port Charles momentarily. Please \r\nfasten your seat belt. ",
        "Ben: \"Two Port Charles doctors home safe.\" Not for long. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Is this the same woman who was drowning her sorrows in a martini \r\nglass? ",
        "Eve: Save it, Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: I'm serious. What changed? ",
        "Eve: I'm serious. It's none of your beeswax. ",
        "Chris: Oh, and just think you were so forthcoming with me. ",
        "Eve: What happened between us and what didn't happen between us is between \r\nus. Comprende? ",
        "Chris: Uh-oh. I better go erase your name off the bathroom wall, huh? ",
        "Eve: Ha ha. ",
        "Chris: You know I won't say anything. ",
        "Eve: Good answer. ",
        "Chris: Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve. You are about the closest thing I have to a friend \r\naround here, and believe it or not, I do want you to be happy. ",
        "Eve: I believe you. ",
        "Chris: Of course, if, you know, you had given me the opportunity, I could've \r\nshown you what true happiness is all about. ",
        "Eve: Oh, that's what I love about you, Ramsey -- you are truly a man with no \r\nego. ",
        "Chris: You know, and I'm fair, too, because I'd be willing to give you a \r\nsecond shot at paradise. ",
        "Eve: Ok. All joking aside, you, underneath it all, are a really good friend. \r\nI know that. You do have a shred of decency. ",
        "Chris: Oh, how generous -- a whole shred. ",
        "Eve: No, I'm serious, and you proved it by not making a move on me. ",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. Don't think it has anything to do with the fact that I \r\nprefer my women conscious. ",
        "Eve: Come on. I'm serious, Ramsey. You are a really good guy -- ",
        "Chris: Hmm. ",
        "Eve: Who would never, ever take advantage of a woman who was not ready for \r\nyou. ",
        "Chris: So is that some sort of subliminal message about Livvie? Because don't \r\nworry -- I haven't corrupted her. ",
        "Eve: Yet. ",
        "Chris: You know something? I've shown so much restraint where that's \r\nconcerned. I'm taking things slow. ",
        "Eve: Uh-huh. Meaning you are just going to let things happen in your time. Do \r\nyou want my advice? ",
        "Chris: No. ",
        "Eve: You will never get anywhere by manipulating people. It won't work. I've \r\ntried to do it. It's a disaster. People who are meant to be together come \r\ntogether on their own. It's not forced. ",
        "Chris: Well, that's very, very sweet, Eve, but I'm not a big believer in \r\nfate. ",
        "Eve: You're impossible, Ramsey. I'm going to get something to eat. Do you \r\nwant me to bring you back anything? ",
        "Chris: No. But thank you. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Chris: I'm just fine, and leaving nothing to chance were Livvie's concerned.\r\n",
        "",
        "Alison: Ok, so, back to our conversation. ",
        "Livvie: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: Are you mental? ",
        "Livvie: Oh -- thanks for the support, Alison. ",
        "Alison: What? I'm sorry. I just -- I don't understand why you are so gung ho \r\nall of a sudden for Chris. ",
        "Livvie: This is not sudden. Chris and I have always been good friends. I've \r\njust been too turned around to see him as something more. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, you've been turned around looking at Jack. All right? Look, \r\nthose are real feelings. I'm sorry, but it's true. ",
        "Livvie: No. Jack and I are over. He made that real clear to me. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, and come on. It's even clearer now that he's seeing someone new.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, please! You think he really takes that skanky biker chick \r\nseriously? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know what Jack takes seriously anymore. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, come on. ",
        "Livvie: No. Really, it's -- it's better this way. Everything happens for a \r\nreason. ",
        "Alison: So then why are you trying to make it happen with Chris? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not. I'm -- I'm just trying to give him a fair chance. I mean, I \r\n-- I have not let myself be with him, like let myself really, really be with \r\nhim, you know? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, but you really shouldn't have to try and feel something for the \r\nguy. I mean, either you do or you don't. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I do. Chris is great. And, come on, he knows me so well, and we \r\nhave got so much in common. Chris is a doctor. Gosh, I want to be a doctor so \r\nbad. We like the same music. ",
        "Alison: Oh, wow. Look, you're not going to sell me on this, ok? So who are \r\nyou really trying to convince? ",
        "Livvie: Hi, Victor. ",
        "Victor: Hi, sweetheart. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to seem ungrateful. I just wasn't expecting \r\nto leave so soon. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I understand that, but the family's ready for you now. ",
        "Arianna: I didn't see the name of the place I'd be living. ",
        "Victor: Well, Ian can't know that information. ",
        "Arianna: What? Why? ",
        "Ian: We don't want anyone to be able to track you down through me. ",
        "Arianna: So you can't call me? I'm never going to talk to you again? ",
        "Victor: No, just -- just for a period of time. It's much safer if there's \r\nabsolutely no contact whatsoever. ",
        "Ian: Right. And once you're safe, I'll tell the INS you left me and that we \r\ndon't know where you are. ",
        "Victor: Which will be perfectly true because you and I will be the only \r\npeople who know where you're living. ",
        "Ian: Family sounds really nice. ",
        "Victor: And as you requested, we even managed to arrange training for you as \r\na teacher's aide. ",
        "Ian: So what do you say? ",
        "Arianna: Nice. It sounds nice. ",
        "Ian: No, no, it's so much more than that. This is what you wanted -- a new \r\nplace, a new life, and a chance to be your own person. ",
        "Arianna: You're right. And -- ",
        "Victor: Excuse me. ",
        "Ian: So, do you have any other questions? ",
        "Arianna: Just one. ",
        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Arianna: I already told you that I would go away, leave you, and won't make a \r\nfuss. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? ",
        "Arianna: I was just wondering -- are you rushing me away because you can't \r\nwait to be with Eve? Is that the real reason why you're in such a hurry?",

        "Lucy: Ok, I have been seriously thinking about how we can get Alison to talk \r\nto Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: So have I and I've decided it's a bad idea. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Kevin: What I have to do is respect Livvie's wishes. She's a grown woman and \r\nI have to treat her like one. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, that's a great idea. Let's do that -- as soon as we get her away \r\nfrom Chris. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I've already told her how I feel about him. And she's asked me \r\nto trust her to make her own decisions, so, I -- the only thing I can do is \r\ntrust her to see Chris for who he really is. ",
        "Lucy: That is not all you can do, Doc. Come on, you can't just send Livvie \r\noff into a lion's den and watch while she gets devoured. That'd be like knowing \r\nthe Titanic is going to sink and waving bye-bye to Leo, or that blimpy thing is \r\ngoing to crash and you go ahead and bye a ticket for someone and give them a \r\nfree ride or -- ",
        "Kevin: Ok! Ok. Enough with the analogies. Maybe you're right. ",
        "Lucy: I am. I know I am. I'm absolutely right. So, what are we going to do?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, I can't just let him ruin my daughter's life. ",
        "Lucy: No, you can't, Doc. You know, he has ruined a lot of people's lives.\r\n",
        "Kevin: This means some serious action. ",
        "Lucy: You are right. What's the plan? What are we going to do? ",

        "Kim: What do you want me to do with it? ",
        "Chris: Um -- you know what? Why don't you bring it over to my office? I would \r\nlike to look over the results and double-check the pathology report. Ok? Great. \r\nBye-bye. Hey. ",

        "Chris: No, no. ",
        "Livvie: But they told me that you were on a break, so -- ",

        "Chris: Livvie, stop. ",
        "Livvie: No, please. Please, Chris, let me finish. I am so sorry for all the \r\nback-and-forth with Jack. It was stupid and it wasn't fair to you.

I've been in Port Charles all my life and it's got everything. \r\nAlthough, we could use a better mall, you know. That could use some work. But, \r\nyou know, as far as, like, the people, the really important stuff, the people \r\nand the community and everything, they are just the coolest. And they say that \r\nit's a really great place to raise kids. Although, you will probably find that \r\nout much sooner than I will. Can I get you anything else? ",
