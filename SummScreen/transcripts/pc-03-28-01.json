        "Karen: Hey. ",
        "Frank: Hey. Wow, you're a sight for sore eyes. ",
        "Karen: Any luck connecting with our computer pal, Cookie? ",
        "Frank: Now who's obsessed? No, I've sent messages out there, but no answers. \r\nI think Cookie's really a 60-year-old trucker with a beer gut who's just doing \r\nthis for a joke. ",
        "Karen: No way. It's pretty obvious that this is a kid that's going through \r\nthe same torture I went through in high school. ",
        "Frank: I just wonder why she cut us off so suddenly, when we were having such \r\na good discussion. ",
        "Karen: Who knows? She's a teenager. Remember? ",
        "Frank: You got to admit, though, it's mysterious. I mean, all of a sudden, \r\nout of the blue, I am in contact with this 16-year-old girl. ",
        "Karen: I know. The computer guy said we're not connected to the Internet. \r\nCome on, let's send her another message. ",
        "Frank: I thought you had to be back at the hospital. ",
        "Karen: Well, there's time. I want to know more about Cookie and how we \r\nconnected to her. ",
        "Frank: All right. ",

        "Man: Cookie! ",
        "Cookie: Yes, Daddy? ",
        "Man: Don't \"Yes, Daddy\" me! I told you about this. ",
        "Cookie: I know, but -- ",
        "Man: I warned you over and over not to mess with my machine. ",
        "Cookie: I just was using it for a minute. ",
        "Man: You spend way too much time on this damn thing, and I am sick and tired \r\nof it. ",
        "Cookie: Please, Daddy -- ",
        "Man: It's too late for that now. You went against me again. Give me that \r\nlocket. ",
        "Cookie: No, not this. You know who gave it to me. ",
        "Man: Damn right I know. That's why I'm taking it. Maybe now you'll understand \r\nI mean what I say when I'm saying it. Now, give it. ",

        "Kevin: Jamal, you're supposed to be done. When can I get my bike back? ",
        "Jack: Well, as soon as it gets ready. ",
        "Kevin: I thought Jamal would be working on it. ",
        "Jack: Don't worry. It'll be done in a few. Then you can take it for a ride.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I'll wait, then. ",
        "Jack: I'll work, then. ",
        "Kevin: So, how's the tug of war coming? ",
        "Jack: I'm not sure what you're talking about. ",
        "Kevin: I mean the game that you and your brother are playing with my daughter \r\n-- the one that's ripping her heart out. ",

        "Chris: So, Livvie, you really meant it when you said that you wanted us to be \r\ntogether. ",
        "Livvie: I mean it. I -- I just need some time to figure some things out, but \r\nyou will not be sorry you waited. I promise I'll make it up to you. ",

        "Frank: It's not connecting. Man, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\r\n",
        "Karen: When the poor girl was going on about high school, it was like I was \r\nright back in those hallways, counting the seconds for the bell to ring. ",
        "Frank: It's too bad I went to another high school. I would have kept you \r\ncompany. ",
        "Karen: Oh, you would not have been caught dead with me. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you're probably right. What can I say? I was a dumb jock. ",
        "Karen: Well, you sure looked great on the field. ",
        "Frank: You came to the games? ",
        "Karen: Only when PC High played St. Edward's, and maybe a couple of other \r\ntimes. ",
        "Frank: I thought you said football was stupid. ",
        "Karen: Well, I pretended it was. I used to stand underneath the bleachers and \r\nwatch. ",
        "Frank: I made some good plays. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, on and off the field. I used to watch you during the off season. \r\nYou were sitting in the bleachers with your dates, eating hot dogs, laughing, \r\nmaking out. God, you looked so normal. ",
        "Frank: You know, it suddenly struck me. All the things I missed doing with \r\nyou -- you know, proms, games, school activities, making out before fourth \r\nperiod. ",
        "Karen: Do you ever wonder what it would be like if you and I had connected \r\nback then? ",
        "Frank: Only all the time. ",

        "Chris: Be back as soon as I can. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, please tell me I didn't see what I think I just saw. ",
        "Livvie: Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: You aren't -- tell me you're not thinking of going to bed with that \r\nidiot Chris. ",
        "Livvie: Look, Lucy, either you accept that I'm with Chris, or I have nothing \r\nto say to you. ",
        "Lucy: Come on, you know I'm just trying to help. ",
        "Livvie: I know, I know. I know what you're trying, and I appreciate it, but I \r\ndon't want your advice on Chris. Ok? He has been incredible to me. You just \r\nwon't give him any credit. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I'll give him lots of credit -- credit for trying to pull the wool \r\nover your eyes. ",
        "Livvie: He knows my heart, Lucy. Things I've wished and hoped for, Chris \r\nfigures them out. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Such as what? ",
        "Livvie: Music. I mean, he got me tickets to the Brad Masters concert, and \r\nthey are, like, my absolute favorite group. I didn't tell him. He just knew. ",
        "Lucy: Well, of course he knew that. All kids your age today like Brad \r\nMasters. ",
        "Livvie: Ok -- pre-med. Helping me get into the program at PCU, and I never \r\nsaid a word to him about wanting to be a doctor. What, you think all kids my age \r\njust want to be doctors? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, no, but -- ",
        "Livvie: It's like he's -- he's like a soul mate, like the universe is sending \r\nme a sign. You know, your friend the universe -- it's telling me that we are \r\nperfect for each other. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Livvie, please. ",
        "Livvie: Come on. How else could he know? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. But I do know him, and believe you me, simpatico is not \r\nChris Ramsey's middle name. Come on, Livvie, really. He is incapable of ESP. \r\nThat is certainly not his strong suit. ",
        "",
        "Chris: I was hoping this was you. ",
        "Kim: I saw you and Livvie when I came in, so I beeped you. ",
        "Chris: That's a smart move. Oh, is that her diary? ",
        "Kim: Yes, I -- you're welcome. ",
        "Chris: Perfect. Ok, I'm going to make copies of the pages I need, and then \r\nI'm going to put the diary back in that drawer. ",
        "Kim: Where I can pick it up. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, and put it back where you found it. ",
        "Kim: When? ",
        "Chris: Stop by tomorrow morning. ",
        "Kim: What if she misses it before then? ",
        "Chris: Believe me, I'll be keeping Livvie too busy. She -- don't worry about \r\nher diary. You need to get back to Estelle. ",
        "Kim: Yeah. I told her I wouldn't be gone long. ",
        "Chris: Well, then go. ",
        "Livvie's Voice: I still can't believe Chris is doing all he's doing to help \r\nme get into college. He's amazing. ",
        "Chris: Yes, he is. ",
        "Livvie: All my dreams are coming true. Except -- ",
        "Chris: \"Except -- if I do get into the program, it means so much studying. I \r\nguess I'll have to give up the idea of taking a year and traveling around the \r\nworld with Jennifer. We talked about it all through high school, but as much as \r\nI want to see Paris and sit in a little cafe and look out at the most romantic \r\ncity on the planet, I guess it'll just have to wait. Or maybe I'll never get \r\nthere.\" ",

        "Karen: You and I would've never gotten together in high school, even if we \r\nhad gone to the same one. I mean, you were the star jock. I was the outsider \r\nliving this weird double life -- honor student by day, lonely kid with mom \r\npassed out on the couch at night. Am I sounding sorry for myself or what? High \r\nschool was not a lot of fun for me. ",
        "Frank: I wish you'd come and talked to me. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, right. ",
        "Frank: No, no, really. You know, my dad, he went on his share of benders, \r\ntoo. And being the older kid, I guess I always kind of felt like the man of the \r\nhouse -- you know, protecting my mom and Joe. ",
        "Karen: So, in a way, we were connected and didn't even know it. ",
        "Frank: Oh, I'm so sorry I never paid more attention to you back then. ",
        "Karen: That's just what you needed, somebody else to take care of. ",
        "Frank: No. No, I would've told you how beautiful you were, how special. ",

        "Jack: If you want to talk, don't start by lumping me in the same category as \r\nmy brother. Ok, I know you don't like me. Hey, you know, I can live with that.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, I have a lot of reasons for that. ",
        "Jack: And good ones, too. I'm not saying you don't. I made some lousy \r\nchoices. But Chris -- well, Chris is his own -- pick your favorite animal -- and \r\nI'm me. ",
        "Kevin: But you tried to use Livvie. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I did. In order to get back at my brother. And believe me, it was \r\na mistake. ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. That was a big one. ",
        "Jack: Look, Dr. Collins, I don't think you understand. But from the moment I \r\nmet your daughter, there was something different. And that's the truth. \r\nSomething incredible happened between us for the first time in my life, and \r\nhers, too. ",
        "Kevin: Which was? ",
        "Jack: We were honest with each other. We were honest with each other in a way \r\nthat we had never been with anybody else. ",
        "Kevin: Well, Livvie was. ",
        "Jack: Look, I know I screwed up from the beginning with her -- you know, for \r\nall the messed-up reasons. And I know there's nothing I can say or do, you know, \r\nthat can make up for it. I learned my lesson. You know, you can't take it back.\r\n",
        "Kevin: That's a hard one. ",
        "Jack: Well, it's over. I lost her to Chris, and I don't blame her for that. \r\nAnd now I got to live with that for the rest of my life. But just so you know, \r\nthere's nothing you can do or say that'll hurt me, not more than I've hurt \r\nmyself. ",

        "Lucy: Hey, Chris. You got a minute? ",
        "Chris: Why, Lucy? So you can jump all over me about Livvie again? You know, \r\nwhy not? Let's do it. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, no, no. Au Contraire, I'm not here to give you a hard time, \r\nactually. I'm just here to tell you I had a wonderful conversation with Livvie \r\nabout you. It was very mature, a very calm and understanding thingy. You know \r\nwhat she said? She explained to me why the two of you are just so good together.\r\n",
        "Chris: And you agreed with her 100%. ",
        "Lucy: Ooh, I guess that would be a bit of an overestimation. ",
        "Chris: Oh, right, right, because you can't stand the sight of me. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy, that's an underestimation. But hey, you know, it doesn't have \r\nanything to do with how I really, really feel about you. What's important here \r\nis that I respect Livvie and I respect her wishes. That's what I want to try and \r\ndo. So, if she's going to choose to have you in her life, then Kevin and I are \r\njust going to have to come to accept that. I guess we're going to have to learn \r\nto tolerate you. ",
        "Chris: I see. So you stopped by to let me know that you're going to do your \r\nbest to tolerate me. Gee, thanks. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, actually, that's not quite the only reason I stopped \r\nby. I really wanted to tell you I just want you to treat Livvie right. ",
        "Chris: This coming from the woman that Livvie found in bed with my little \r\nbrother -- a guy that Livvie happened to be dating at the time. Hey, you know \r\nwhat? What do I care, right? I should be thanking you. I mean, if Livvie hadn't \r\nfound out about you two, then she wouldn't know what kind of a guy Jack really \r\nis. So thank you so much for opening her eyes. ",

In fact, Bennie, I'm going to leave Dr. Ramsey 50 little surprises. So \r\nI just thought, you know, since I can't get in with my key, I thought maybe that \r\nif you had the 50 little surprises, maybe you could let me in with your \r\nsuper-duper, handy-dandy, janitor-type key thingy, huh?
