        "Paige: Hello, Rafe. Surprised to see me? ",
        "Rafe: What are you doing here, Paige? ",
        "Paige: Actually, I'm here to see Alison. Look, I realize it's probably not \r\nthe best time, but -- ",
        "Rafe: What do you want with her? ",
        "Paige: You're not going to believe this. I mean, I can barely believe it \r\nmyself, but I -- ",
        "Rafe: No, believe what? What are you doing here, and how did you know where \r\nwe were? ",
        "Paige: Well, Livvie told me. I just found out that your girlfriend and I are \r\nrelated. I mean, imagine my shock. I thought all of my family was gone, every \r\nlast one of them, but it's not true. There's still Alison. I mean, she was my \r\npurpose for coming back -- ",
        "Rafe: Purpose -- what purpose are you talking about? ",
        "Paige: Wait, I don't understand. Why are you getting so hostile? ",
        "Rafe: It's a simple question. What purpose do you have in mind for Alison?\r\n",
        "Paige: Where is she, Rafe? I need to see her. ",
        "Rafe: No, no. No, Paige, forget it. You can't have her. ",
        "Paige: Excuse me? ",
        "Rafe: Just get out of here! You are not going to put her in the fifth chair. \r\nI won't let you. ",

        "Ricky: Jamal. Jamal, don't worry. I'll get you out of here, all right? Don't \r\nworry -- ",
        "Amy's Voice: I can tell and I can feel the way that you look at me when we're \r\nalone, like you're looking at me now, and I don't want to ruin your marriage. \r\nI'll be gone in a few days. Only you can make my last wish come true. ",
        "Ian's Voice: Do you know what you're asking me, Amy? ",
        "Amy's Voice: Yes. I want to know what love feels like. I don't want to die \r\nnever knowing what that's like. Please, Ian, make love to me. Don't turn away.\r\n",
        "Colleen: Ian? Hello? ",
        "Ian: I'm sorry. Did -- did you say something? ",
        "Colleen: Yeah, I said you look like you're a million miles away. ",
        "Ian: Well, I guess I was. ",
        "Colleen: Problem with a patient? ",
        "Ian: No, it's a friend of mine who's going through a rough time right now. \r\nHere. ",

        "Ian: Vacation/honeymoon, right? ",
        "Eve: Right. ",
        "Ian: You'd better save some energy because I think you're going to need it.\r\n",
        "Colleen: Um -- if you guys will excuse me, I have something I probably need \r\nto check on. ",
        "Ian: I think we embarrassed her. ",
        "Eve: I think maybe just a little. ",
        "Ian: So, almost ready? ",
        "Eve: Almost. Twelve more files and then I'm all yours. We can sail away off \r\ninto the sunset. ",

        "Jamal: Come on, man, why don't you let him go, all right? ",
        "J.D.: Yeah. That's going to happen. ",

        "Jamal: Sorry, man. I didn't mean to get you into this. ",
        "J.D.: No. No, he didn't mean to. But here you are. And lucky me, I get two \r\nfor the price of one. ",

        "J.D.: Frankenstein, is that any way to talk to me, huh? ",
        "Ricky: Oh! Oh! ",
        "J.D.: See, I thought pretty boy here might have learned his lesson the last \r\ntime he messed with me. God knows I gave him enough to remember me by. Yeah. Not \r\na bad job if I say so myself. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, J.D. Just let him go. This is between me and you, all right?\r\n",
        "J.D.: Hey, you know, I can really appreciate the way that you two have \r\nbonded. But maybe I should let you in on a little something. Neither one of you \r\nis going anywhere. Ever. ",
        "Ricky: You'll never get away with this. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, people -- only a matter of time before they come looking for us \r\n-- ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, my girlfriend, she knows where I'm going, all right? She'll send \r\nsomebody for me! ",
        "J.D.: You know what? Nobody's coming after you because nobody knows where you \r\nare. And even if they did, nobody gives a damn about you, anyway. See? It's too \r\nlate. ",
        "Casey: Come on, man, you said you only had one more thing to do for your mom, \r\nthen you'd be right back. ",
        "[Casey sighs] ",
        "Casey: Maybe not. Maybe -- maybe last night was just another night for you. \r\nHuh? And I was just your latest hit-and-run victim, hmm? No. It can't be that \r\nway. Is that how it is, Ricky? Because I don't know if I can take it if -- wait \r\na minute. You wrote something down here when your mom called. An address. But \r\nwhy would you need your mother's address? Oh! That's bull! Ooh, ooh, ooh, \r\nooh. If this is some other chick's number, you are so busted. I'm going to -- \r\nwarehouse 127 River Street? What? Oh, my God, Ricky. What did you get yourself \r\ninto? ",

        "Colleen: What about the rotation? ",
        "Eve: Rotation -- yes. We'll have the schedule up for the next two weeks \r\ntoday. If anybody has a problem with it, they can take it up with Alan. ",
        "Colleen: Right. ",
        "Eve: Right. Also, here is a list of my patients and the doctors who are \r\ntaking over for me and -- their case notes, right here. ",
        "Colleen: Great, ok. I'll put these in the doctors' boxes. ",

        "Ian: What do you mean? You just said you -- ",
        "Eve: Well, I know, but I still have a million things to do. I have some \r\nlast-minute packing, some last-minute shopping, and the travel agency called. \r\nThe tickets are ready, but they're going to close early, so - ",
        "Ian: All right, well, we'll go together. What else you got? ",
        "Eve: Gosh -- oh, oh, oh. The brochure. You have to take a look at this \r\nbrochure -- remember? -- And look at some of the stuff that we want to do. ",

        "[Eve sighs] ",

        "Ian: What stuff? ",
        "Eve: Well, there's, like, massage treatments, there's horseback riding -- oh, \r\nbaby spa. Speaking of baby spa, we could hire a sitter for Danny one night so \r\nthat you and I could have a little alone time together, if you know what I mean.\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know what you mean, but I don't know -- except I've -- ",
        "Eve: What? Except what? ",

        "Eve: Ian Thornhart. ",
        "Ian: Come on, the kid's not going to mind. It's only going to be a couple \r\nhours. We got a lot of making up to do. ",

        "Ian: You got me curious. I mean, your -- ",

        "Ian: Ok, I'll wait. ",
        "Eve: Ok. And in the meantime, check out the brochure, ok? See what kind of \r\nstuff you want to sign up for. ",
        "Ian: All right, I will. ",

        "Rafe: Paige, you might as well get out of here because there's no way you're \r\ngetting in there. ",
        "Paige: What is your problem, Rafe? What are you afraid of? ",
        "Rafe: I think you know. ",
        "Paige: Oh, my God. Have you been talking to Lucy? Is that what this is about? \r\nBecause she seems to think that I want to do harm to Alison, as well. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, really? I wonder why. ",
        "Paige: That's ridiculous! ",
        "Rafe: Well, then what do you want with her? ",
        "Paige: I just told you. I just found out that we're related. I want to meet \r\nher, I want to talk to her. What's wrong with that? ",
        "Rafe: I'll tell you what's wrong with that. I was just up in the Barrington \r\nattic, and I saw a picture -- a portrait of a woman who looks exactly like you, \r\nPaige. ",
        "Paige: What? ",
        "Rafe: Alison's great-great-great grandma Rebecca. ",
        "Paige: Rebecca. Oh, my God, that's the missing portrait from my family home. \r\nDon't you see? That's even more proof that this is meant to be. Please, Rafe --\r\n",
        "Rafe: No! ",
        "Paige: But -- ",
        "Rafe: Paige, I had a dream, and in this dream, I saw Alison's name in the \r\nbook of records, and then I saw Alison, and she was sitting in the fifth chair.\r\n",
        "Paige: So? Like you said, it was a dream. ",
        "Rafe: No, except I don't think it was just a dream. I think it was a vision \r\nof the future, a warning of what's to come. ",
        "Paige: Look, Rafe, even if that's true, what's it got to do with me? ",
        "Rafe: My guess is everything. ",
        "Paige: What on earth are you talking about? ",
        "Rafe: Please, drop the innocent act because I'm just not buying it anymore.\r\n",
        "Paige: What? ",
        "Rafe: Just think about it. Think about all your time here, everywhere you've \r\nbeen, everything you've done. Isn't it funny how death just seems to follow you \r\nwherever you go? ",
        "Paige: What are you saying? ",
        "Rafe: I'm saying that everyone you get close to eventually ends up in danger \r\n-- Kevin, Christina -- and now you want to know Alison? Well, forget it, Paige! \r\nJust forget it. That fifth chair is still empty, and I'm not going to let you \r\nfill it with her. ",
        "Paige: Rafe, you're way off base here. ",
        "Rafe: No. ",
        "Paige: Ok? Look, I think I know what's going on. You're letting your fears of \r\nwhat's to come get the best of you. They're taking over, but -- ",
        "Rafe: No. No. ",
        "Paige: You couldn't be more wrong, Rafe. The last thing in the world I would \r\nwant is for Alison to die. And even if that is, God forbid, her destiny, you \r\ncan't stop it from happening, just like you can't stop me from completing my \r\njourney, not when I've come this close. ",
        "Rafe: I will do everything I can to protect her. ",
        "Paige: Rafe, listen to me. Look into my eyes, into my heart. I'm telling you \r\nthe truth. I know you want to spend your last few hours on earth with her, and I \r\ndon't want to take you away from her. ",
        "Rafe: Well, then why? ",
        "Paige: Because I need this. I need to connect with someone and that someone \r\nis her. I need to know what we mean to each other. Please, just a few moments, \r\nthat's all I ask. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. Let me just go talk to her and see if she wants to do this. ",
        "Paige: Thank you, Rafe. ",

        "Jamal: Look, why don't you stop jerking us around, J.D., and just tell us \r\nwhat's on your mind? ",
        "J.D.: What's on my mind? Money -- and payback. See, while the two of you are \r\ntrapped in here, I'm going to be making some fat bank on a little torch job. \r\nWhoops. That can't be good. Damn. So close but so far away. You know, I'd love \r\nto stick around to see how this thing turns out, but it's getting a little warm \r\nin here, huh?
