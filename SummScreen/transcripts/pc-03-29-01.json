        "Karen: That's just what you needed -- somebody else to take care of. ",
        "Frank: No. No, I would have told you how beautiful you were, how special. ",
        "Karen: So, would you have taken me to your prom? ",
        "Frank: You bet. ",

        "Frank: What are you doing tonight? ",
        "Karen: Well, what did you have in mind? ",
        "Frank: Did anyone tell you you're nosy? If you must know, I'm taking you \r\nsomewhere special. ",
        "Karen: Where? ",
        "Frank: And you're pushy. Just put yourself in my hands. ",
        "Karen: Well, that's a good start, but I'd like to have a few more details \r\njust so I can be prepared. ",
        "Frank: Just be prepared to have a great time, and be ready at 8:00. ",

        "Arianna: Well, I was thinking of going by the hospital first and -- ",
        "Ian: If it's about your medical records, I'll pick them up later. I've got to \r\ngo in anyway. ",
        "Arianna: It's more than that. I need to say my thank-yous in person. ",
        "Ian: Your thank-yous? ",
        "Arianna: To Gabby and Joe. They've done a lot for me. They've helped me a lot \r\nthese last months. And Eve, too. ",
        "Ian: You can't say good-bye, I'm sorry. Not to anyone. ",

        "Eve: I don't know where my head has been lately. I could have sworn I had a \r\nchange of clothes in my locker. ",
        "Gabriela: Your head has been about a million places. And it was no problem \r\ngetting that stuff for you. ",
        "Eve: Well, thank you. I appreciate it. And not just for this. Ian told me \r\nwhat happened in London with Arianna's brother Ben. ",
        "Gabriela: I have been trying to put that man out of my head ever since. He \r\nscared me half to death. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, crazy, violent people tend to do that to everyone. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm just glad to be back home. ",
        "Eve: Well, because of you and your fast thinking, that man will never be able \r\nto set foot in this country again. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, thank God for that. ",

        "Eve: I mean, when I heard about how you ran into Ben -- you know what? I am \r\ntired of looking over my shoulder and waiting for bad news like him to pop out \r\nfrom nowhere and ruin everything. I have made a decision. ",
        "Gabriela: What's that? ",
        "Eve: I am going to concentrate on happily ever after. I mean, even Arianna's \r\ngoing to get her happy ending. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, we all deserve it. ",
        "Eve: Exactly. And I am not going to wait around and let thoughts of Ben make \r\nme doubt my own happiness. ",
        "Gabriela: Wish I could just flip a switch and stop thinking about him. ",
        "Eve: Well, I don't think that you have anything to worry about. The only \r\nperson that Ben is after is Arianna, and the bottom line is Ian is not going to \r\nlet him hurt any of us. ",

        "Arianna: I have to say something to Eve. I can't just disappear. ",
        "Ian: The only way to keep you safe is to do just that. And I'll explain it to \r\nJoe, I'll explain it to Eve and Gabby. But they can't know where you're going. \r\nThey can't even know when you're leaving. If you're going to run in secret, you \r\ncan't say goodbye to people. ",
        "Arianna: Not even to you? ",
        "Ian: Victor's coming to get you in the middle of the night. ",

        "Arianna: Like I never existed. ",
        "Ian: That's not true. You're very real to me. ",
        "Arianna: So this is it? After tonight, I won't see you again? ",

        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Chris: Eight years of 24/7. No time to kick back and relax. ",

        "Chris: I know that. But, you know, I wanted you to have a great experience \r\nbefore you get into all that -- all that work. You know, a little something that \r\nwould, you know, create some memories to help you through those long nights of \r\nstudying. ",
