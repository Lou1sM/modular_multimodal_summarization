        "Lucy: Is everything ok? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yeah, fine. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Well, you know, Christina and I were wondering what had \r\nhappened to you. We didn't know where you'd gone. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, it's just -- ",
        "Lucy: It's just Paige, huh? ",
        "Kevin: It suddenly occurred to me that I'll probably never see her again, and \r\nI didn't even have a chance to say goodbye. ",
        "Lucy: Maybe it was not meant to be because there she is. ",
        "Kevin: Paige, you're still here. ",
        "Paige: Yeah, I'm still here. ",
        "Lucy: What happened? Did you see Alison? Did you get to meet her? ",
        "Paige: No. Your cousin Rafe stole her away, I'm sure you're very happy to \r\nhear. I didn't even get a chance to see her. ",
        "",
        "Alison: You woke me up out of that barn and pulled me out of there like it \r\nwas on fire. Now what's going on? ",
        "Rafe: There's nothing going on. I just didn't think we should waste any more \r\ntime sleeping. ",
        "Alison: No, please don't give me that, ok? Now, it's obvious that we have \r\nbeen running from something and we have been for the last couple of days. So \r\njust tell me what, what is it? ",
        "Rafe: All you have to know is that I'm trying to keep you safe. ",
        "Alison: Ok, safe from what? Rafe, please? Please? I'm not going another step \r\nuntil you tell me what this is all about. ",
        "Rafe: There's another angel, someone you haven't met. ",
        "Alison: Ok, and? ",
        "Rafe: I'm afraid that she's here to take you back. I'm afraid that she wants \r\nyou to fill the fifth chair. ",

        "Ricky: Casey, go! Save yourself! ",
        "Casey: No! I am not leaving here without you! ",
        "Casey: Ah! ",
        "Ricky: You've got to get out of here, please! ",

        "Amy: I can't thank you enough for coming here. ",
        "Ian: You don't have to thank me. ",
        "Amy: It's just the thought of spending these last moments on earth alone --\r\n",
        "Ian: How can I help? ",
        "Amy: Just be with me. And then maybe join me for a drink? ",
        "Ian: Sure. What would you like? ",
        "Amy: I'll get it. I've grown very familiar with this bar in the last few \r\ndays. ",
        "Ian: You sure? ",
        "Amy: Positive. ",
        "Amy: Happy birthday, Papa. ",
        "Ian: You just say something? ",
        "Amy: I -- I would like to propose a toast. Here's to the man that gave my \r\njourney such meaning. ",

        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I am. ",
        "Paige: What a cruel joke, huh? After everything, I'm leaving here without \r\nknowing the reason why I was ever here at all. ",
        "Christina: Don't go, Paige. Don't go. ",
        "Paige: Oh, sweetie. I wish I could stay, I really do, but it's time for me to \r\ngo home now. But I want you to always remember what a lucky little girl you are. \r\nDo you know why you're so lucky? Because you're part of a family. And I want you \r\nto promise me you're going to take care of them. You do that for me? Be a good \r\ngirl now, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Hey. Come here, you. Come here, you. Hey, thank you. That was very, \r\nvery nice of you to say, and I really -- I really do hope you find your peace. \r\nThat peace, whatever it is, I hope you get it. ",
        "Paige: I know. And I also know that Kevin's where he belongs, with his true \r\nsoul mate. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, he is. And I will feel him and love him forever and ever. But, \r\nPaige, that doesn't change the fact that you were his first love, so I think you \r\nneed a way to say goodbye properly. So that means we're going to go find this \r\nperson some dinner, huh? ",
        "Paige: Bye, Christina. ",
        "Christina: Goodbye, Paige. ",
        "Lucy: Goodbye, Paige. ",
        "[Paige sighs] ",
        "Paige: Help me here, Kevin. Tell me how to say goodbye. ",

        "Alison: We both know that if an angel really is coming for me, I mean, \r\nthere's no use in us running. ",
        "Rafe: No, I will not let her take you! ",
        "Alison: We don't even know if that's true. ",
        "Rafe: But it all makes sense! It makes perfect sense! ",
        "Alison: Ok, listen, please. Please listen to me. We don't have that much time \r\ntogether, we really don't, and I don't want to spend it talking about this, \r\nsomething that we have no control over, something that -- that may or may not \r\nhappen. Ok? I just really want to focus on us. ",
        "Rafe: I just need to know when I leave, you stay. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, listen to me. I really do have every intention of living to a \r\nripe old age. Ok? Whatever life throws at me, whatever life really does bring \r\nme, I will carry the promise that I made to you that I will keep your love with \r\nme forever. Ok? So just remember that, ok, and there will be nothing to be \r\nafraid of. ",
        "Rafe: Right, because when an angel loves you, nothing can hurt you, right?\r\n",
        "Alison: Nothing. ",

        "Ian: Wait. ",
        "Amy: What's wrong? ",
        "Ian: I want to make a toast. ",
        "Amy: All right. ",
        "Ian: I've been doing a lot of thinking over the last few days, you know --\r\n",
        "Amy: Ok. ",
        "Ian: About you. ",
        "Amy: Me? ",
        "Ian: Yeah -- who you are and the journey you're on and how I could possibly \r\nfigure into it. And I can't for the life of me figure it out, but I do know this \r\n-- I'm a better man for having known you. ",
        "Amy: You -- you don't have to say this, Ian. ",
        "Ian: No, no, no, it's all right. I said this wasn't about a physical \r\nattraction, either. This was about a closeness, a closeness that, apart from my \r\nwife, I've never felt for anyone. I saw in you an honesty and an openness and an \r\ninnocence that I lost a long time ago. You will always have a place in my heart. \r\nI'm honored that you felt that way about me. It touched my heart. You touched my \r\nheart. And I love you for it. ",
        "Amy: Yeah -- well, that was some toast. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, I didn't mean for it to turn into a speech, but that's the \r\nIrish way. Ok. Let's drink to a woman of great beauty, great passion, and great \r\ncourage. An angel in every sense of the word. Cheers. ",
        "Amy: Stop, I can't do this! ",
        "Amy: How can you say that you love me? You don't know me! You have no idea \r\nwhat I'm capable of doing! ",
        "Ian: What's the matter with you? Get a hold of yourself. ",
        "Amy: I just tried killing you, Ian! ",
        "Ian: You what? ",
        "Amy: Just now, I just tried killing you. ",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? ",
        "Amy: Your wine -- I poisoned it. I wanted you to die. ",
        "Ian: You -- you wanted what? ",
        "Amy: Just like you made my father die. ",
        "Ian: Your father? This is not making any sense. I mean -- ",
        "Amy: Well, then maybe this will clear it up for you. My name is not Amy \r\nStradling. My name is Amy Harris -- the same Harris whose father you killed. And \r\nI wanted to make you pay. That's the only reason why I came back. That's the \r\nreason why I'm here. It was his dying wish. He made me promise to make you \r\nsuffer the way he had. And I tried to hate you. I tried so hard, but I couldn't \r\ndo it because I fell in love with you. I couldn't do it. ",
        "Ian: You're Harris' daughter? ",
        "Amy: Yeah. Now you see? You could never really love a monster like me. ",
        "Ian: You're nothing like your father. He tried to fill you with hatred and \r\nbitterness, but he couldn't succeed because inside of you beats the heart of an \r\nangel. ",
        "Amy: I'm sorry. ",
        "Ian: Shh. It's ok, it's ok. ",
        "Amy: I'm so sorry. ",

        "Paige: Promise me you'll tell Alison about me. ",

        "Paige: Please tell her I'm -- I'm sorry I didn't meet her. ",

        "Paige: What do you mean? ",
        "Kevin: It's because of you that Christina began to trust me and accept me. \r\nYou're the reason we're a real family now. And your heart and your spirit will \r\nalways be a part of that. ",
        "Paige: I'll never forget you. ",
