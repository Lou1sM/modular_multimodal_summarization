        "Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where the hell do you think you're going? You going to leave me here like this?",
        "Lucy: I am going to leave you all alone by yourself, because that's what you deserve. You've earned this!",
        "Kevin: You've earned it, too, Lucy.",

        "Kevin: Hey -- hey! Who is -- help! Help!",
        "Karen: Kevin --",
        "Kevin: Karen --",
        "Karen: What's wrong?",
        "Kevin: Is that you? Karen, get me out of this.",
        "Karen: God! What happened?",
        "Kevin: Karen -- I don't have time to explain, just cut me loose, please.",
        "Karen: But I -- I don't --",
        "Kevin: Karen -- I was attacked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Yeah, wait a second. I think I got a better way.",
        "Ian: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Rafe: You kill him.",
        "Ian: I what?",
        "Rafe: Well, that's the goal, right? The goal is to get rid of Joshua and save you.",
        "Ian: Yeah?",
        "Rafe: Well, that's what we do -- you bite him. You make him bleed until he dies, all right? You feed on him.",
        "Ian: I'm not biting anybody.",
        "Rafe: You told me to find another way. Well, this is your other way. You feed on him, he dies, and then we can put you in the spring and save you, all right?",
        "Alison: Lucy. Hi. We -- we didn't hear you come in.",
        "Lucy: Rafe's right, you know. If it means saving your life, you have no choice. You have to kill Joshua.",
        "Ian: It's not that simple.",
        "Rafe: It is.",
        "Ian: I'm not doing it. End of story, Rafe.",
        "Lucy: You are. You have to. If this means you get cured, then you have to do it for you, and for me and for us.",
        "Ian: And, what, lose my soul in the process?",
        "Lucy: You wouldn't lose your soul. It's not about that, it's about surviving. Defeating evil is not losing your soul.",
        "Alison: She's right, Ian. She has a point.",
        "Ian: I'm not going to feed on another human being!",
        "Lucy: He's not human. You know that. He's a vampire.",
        "Ian: I don't care what he is! I'm not doing it!",
        "Rafe: All right. All right, that's it. Come on, let's get out of here. We're not going to have time to get those vampires, get them in the hot spring, all right? Alison?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm ready. And do you have the music and everything?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it's right here.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Now, remember, when the vampires are in the hot spring, you turn it up loud.",
        "Ian: And cut it off if it starts afflicting one of our slayers, all right?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Ian: I'm going to go get Joshua.",
        "Lucy: Good. I'm going to go with you.",
        "Ian: No, you're not. I can handle it.",
        "Lucy: I'm sure you can, but I want to help you. I want to be there. I'm a slayer. I can help you. I'm going.",
        "Ian: You're a slayer, and that's why you have to go with Rafe to the hot spring.",
        "Rafe: Especially when Caleb arrives. Now, Alison, you sure you're going to be all right?",
        "Alison: Yeah. No, I'm fine. I'm fast. I will be fine.",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. Promise me you will at least consider this -- at least consider killing Joshua? Just promise you'll put it in your mind in case -- please?",
        "Ian: It was in my mind. I thought about it.",
        "Rafe: Ok, come on. Let's go. Showtime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Mmm. Caleb, this is just what I wanted. Oh, everything I ever dreamed of.",
        "Caleb: Only now you have a love of all things and the fun of being very, very bad.",
        "Livvie: Which Tess never would've enjoyed.",
        "Caleb: I came to my senses. I realized you're what I want, all of you.",
        "Livvie: All of me? Huh? Not just my lips? Or my heart?",
        "Caleb: You have many good parts.",
        "Livvie: Stop teasing me. Feed on me. Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: You were attacked? How?",
        "Kevin: I -- that's not important right now, Karen! Come on, will you please?",
        "Karen: All right, just slow down, ok? They tied this a little tight.",
        "Kevin: I'm grateful for this. Two men broke in.",
        "Karen: But the room -- it doesn't look like anybody --",
        "Kevin: They took some stuff from upstairs. I came in while they were still here. They tied me up like this before I had a chance to call the police. Come on, Karen, please! My hands are turning numb!",
        "Karen: This is tight, all right? You know, it is a little weird walking in on you like this.",
        "Kevin: Oh.",
        "Karen: There.",
        "Kevin: Thank you.",
        "Karen: Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Kevin: I'm fine, really, thank you.",
        "Karen: Well, maybe I should check you before you leave.",
        "Kevin: No, no, no. I -- I don't have time right now. I need to do something.",
        "Karen: Wait, we should call the police. They should --",
        "Kevin: No police. Understand? I'll take care of this myself.",
        "Karen: Kevin, will you wait one minute?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Whew! Ok. If the water doesn't work, then we resort to our slayer weapons, right?",
        "Rafe: It's going to work, but I just want it to be safe.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. And everybody knows their job, everybody knows their place, right?",
        "Rafe: Right.",
        "Lucy: Right. Even -- even you, cousin.",
        "Rafe: Lucy, Ian's going to be all right.",
        "Lucy: Why does he have to be so damn honorable and -- and stubborn and headstrong and --",
        "Rafe: Maybe -- maybe because you wouldn't have him any other way.",
        "Lucy: No, you're right. And I know this is all right in my heart. It's just -- you know.",
        "Rafe: I know. Look, we're going to find some other way to take care of Ian, but for now we got to take one step at a time, all right? This could be the endgame tonight. We have to focus.",
        "Lucy: Right. I am so focused. Watch this focus -- it's good focus. Ok, come on. We're going to get Caleb. I know it. What if Caleb doesn't show up, though?",
        "Rafe: Trust me, he starts feeling his kingdom slip away, he'll show up.",
        "Lucy: What if everybody else shows up? What if everyone else shows up --",
        "Rafe: Lucy, Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Caleb doesn't show up --",
        "Rafe: Lucy!",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Rafe: Stop. Focus. Now, tell me, what do we have to do?",
        "Lucy: Ok, right -- your plan. A, I plan the music. B, I play the music over and over again. Three, we get them in the pool. And, d, they're all cured, even Caleb.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, especially Caleb. We are going to get rid of all his vampire powers.",
        "Lu: Right. We are way ahead of the curve, on the right track, ahead of the game, right?",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Right.",
        "Rafe: I want Caleb.",
        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Rafe: And after everything he's done, everyone he's hurt, everyone he's turned, this all begins and ends with him. So if we're going to finish this thing, we have to get Caleb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: No one is more beautiful than you.",
        "Livvie: You mean that?",
        "Caleb: To the depths of my soul.",
        "Livvie: We finally did it. We're exactly who we want to be and we're together.",
        "Caleb: We earned it. We deserve it.",
        "Livvie: You're right. I mean, after everything we've been through, we do deserve to be happy. And I will never do anything to hurt you again.",
        "Caleb: I'll never let anyone hurt you.",
        "Livvie: No one will ever touch us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come on, Reese, where are you? Let's go.",
        "Reese: Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey, good-looking. Are you done for the night?",
        "Reese: Well, it depends. Why didn't you come inside?",
        "Jack: I don't know, I kind of think we have some good memories out here in the alley, don't you think?",
        "[Reese giggles]",
        "Reese: What's the matter?",
        "Jack: You've been feeding.",
        "Reese: Yeah? Well, so what if I have? Maybe I need it, baby.",
        "Jack: Who was it Reese?",
        "Alison: Why does it matter?",
        "Jack: Alison?",
        "Alison: Isn't it bad enough that she feeds off of human blood, not to mention she just tried to feed off of mine?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Reese: Why don't you just back off, all right, Blondie?",
        "Alison: Oh, ok. Let's see here. Your little girlfriend forgot to tell you that she almost bit me.",
        "Jack: Is that true, Reese?",
        "Alison: Reese, you're nothing but a piece of garbage. I wish that Rafe would've killed you when he had the chance. As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to go tell him to finish the job now.",
        "Jack: Alison -- come on, back off, all right? Alison, Reese --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Ho, Caz, hey! Got any time for an old friend, man?",
        "Caz: No, no, you're out of the band, Casey.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, just because I'm out of the band doesn't mean I got to be out of your life, right?",
        "Caz: You know the rules.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but I was, you know, thinking you might be a little more independent these days.",
        "Caz: Whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on, what is this scene? What are you doing?",
        "Casey: Oh, Caz, you know I've always had this thing for you, right?",
        "Caz: Yeah, right, right.",
        "Casey: Please, the way you stroke that guitar? Hmm, hmm.",
        "Caz: Are you coming on to me, Casey?",
        "Casey: You and I, going to a real slamming party, dude.",

        "Ian: All right, Joshua. Let's see what you got here. Calendar or schedule or something. What's this? A floor plan. This is Caleb's place -- right on top of the spring. Now, why would you --",
        "[Doorknob turns]",
        "Joshua: The device never fails? Good. No, I want there to be no survivors when the spring blows. Do I make myself clear? No survivors.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Hmm. I feel so safe in your arms. I feel so strong.",
        "Caleb: We're both stronger than we ever were.",
        "Livvie: Almost untouchable.",
        "Caleb: Almost. What we are is complete.",
        "Livvie: We can have everything we've ever wanted.",
        "Caleb: Whatever we want, whatever we need, it's ours now.",

        "Rafe: I told you. I told you this a million times -- that's a slayer's life.",
        "Lucy: Right. We bait traps, we wait, we be patient, and then we catch them.",
        "Rafe: Right.",
        "Lucy: Right.",

        "Jamal: That's right.",
        "Lucy: How's it coming, cuz?",
        "Rafe: Don't bother trying to move, all right? These are 100% vampire cuffs.",

        "Kevin: Poor bastard, you always were a pain in the neck.",
        "Joshua: Small but deadly.",
