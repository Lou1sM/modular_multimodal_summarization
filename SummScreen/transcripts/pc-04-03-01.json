        "Livvie: Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. You know, I just happened to be in the neighborhood and I saw your \r\ncar. Wondered what you were -- I mean, I thought you were sleeping with Chris.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Come -- come in, please. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. So you sort of fell for that thing that I just happened to be in \r\nthe neighborhood? ",
        "Livvie: I was such a fool, Lucy. You were right when you said Chris had no \r\nclue about me. ",
        "Lucy: What do you mean? What happened? ",
        "Livvie: Well -- ahem -- Chris stole my diary. Then he pretended to know my \r\nevery wish and desire, and he was spying on me, and I bought it. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, that pathetic, creepy little rat. I can't believe that he would \r\ntake your very personal, private property like that -- take your diary, take it \r\nhome with him, and read it and then -- that's disgusting. ",
        "Livvie: Wait -- wait a minute, wait a minute. How did you know Chris took my \r\ndiary home with him? ",
        "",
        "Andy: Get your hands up in the air where I can see them -- now! ",
        "Ben: Well, there seems to be a misunderstanding. What happened to my sister \r\nwas an accident. ",
        "Kevin: You expect us to believe that you accidentally stabbed your sister? \r\nThe only reason you didn't finish her off is because I showed up! ",
        "Andy: Tell us what you did to your sister. ",
        "Ben: I told you. Accidents happen. ",
        "Kevin: All right, I want to make an official statement. As Dr. Kevin Collins, \r\nhead of the Port Charles psychiatric crisis team, I'll testify that this man \r\ntried to kill his sister, Arianna Thornhart. And I was a witness. ",
        "Andy: That's good enough for me. Shapour, you got the right to remain silent.\r\n",
        "Man: That won't be necessary. ",
        "Andy: Yeah? And who are you? ",
        "Man: I'm the attach\u00e9 from our consulate in New York. Mr. Shapour has \r\ndiplomatic immunity. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, you've got to be kidding. ",
        "Ben: Oh, you'd better check the papers. Truth is, Dr. Collins, you can't \r\ntouch me now. I have just become a foreign diplomat. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Charge 200. ",
        "Eve: Charging 200. ",
        "Ian: Clear! ",
        "Joe: Not converted. ",
        "Ian: 300. ",
        "Eve: 300! ",
        "Ian: Clear! Come on, Arianna. Come back to me. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Clear. Got a rhythm. ",
        "Gabriela: She's in sinus and she's got a pulse. ",
        "Eve: Alex, 60 milligrams lidocaine, I.V. Push. ",
        "Gabriela: B.P. 90/40, pulse 124. ",
        "Chris: All right, what do we got? ",
        "Joe: She's unstable, multiple stab wounds, pneumo left side, v-tach converted \r\nto normal sinus tach. ",
        "Chris: Marcela, Monica Quartermaine's finishing up a bypass. Page her, have \r\nher meet us in the O.R. Take over. The patient could bleed out. Let's go. ",
        "Joe: Here we go. ",
        "Ian: Hang in there, Arianna. ",
        "Chris: Dr. Thornhart, Dr. Lambert, you're relieved. I got it covered. ",
        "Ian: Don't even think of it. This is my wife. I'm going in there. ",
        "Chris: There's no time to argue. Let's go! We got blood ordered? ",
        "Joe: We got two units waiting. ",
        "Chris: How much drainage in chest tube? ",
        "Eve: 400 out. ",
        "Joe: Still in sinus tach. ",
        "Chris: Good. Hang in there. ",
        "Eve: All right, go, go, go. ",
        "Joe: Got it? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I got it. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Diplomatic immunity. So who cares? This man tried to kill his own \r\nsister! An honor killing, he calls it. Now, does any of this matter to you, or \r\ndo you just not give a damn? ",
        "Attach\u00e9: If a crime has been committed, Dr. Collins, rest assured our courts \r\nwill handle it in the proper manner. ",
        "Kevin: I can just imagine. ",
        "Andy: These papers check out. Somehow this clown got himself assigned to the \r\nembassy. He's a diplomat. ",
        "Kevin: What does that mean? ",
        "Andy: We can't hold him, Kevin. ",
        "Ben: So can I go now, or is there anything else? ",
        "Kevin: Are we going to let him just walk out? ",
        "Andy: The feds are just as steamed over this stuff as we are. But until they \r\nchange the law, there's nothing we can do. ",
        "Ben: Well, I'll be going, then. I have to go check on my sister. ",
        "Kevin: Not so fast. It's my medical opinion that Mr. Shapour is a danger to \r\nhimself and to others. ",
        "Ben: I told you that there's nothing that you can do to me now. ",
        "Kevin: You want to bet? I can put you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold at \r\nGeneral Hospital. ",
        "Ben: You can't do that. ",
        "Kevin: I can, and I will. You see, that's how things work in this \r\ncountry. You're on my turf now. ",
        "Attach\u00e9: This is outrageous. ",
        "Kevin: No, this is state law, which means I have the authority to make the \r\ncall. Andy? ",
        "Andy: Escort our diplomatic guest to the psych ward at the hospital. ",
        "Ben: You're not going to stop me from doing what I came here to do. ",
        "Kevin: Really? You'd be surprised what I can do. And people get lost in our \r\nsystem all the time. ",
        "Ben: Are you going to let him threaten me like that? ",
        "Andy: Lodge a complaint at the next diplomat's meeting. ",
        "Kevin: People get lost in our system sometimes for weeks at a time. \r\nEspecially the suspects. And when they're found -- if they're found -- they're \r\nnever the same. ",
        "Attach\u00e9: We'll fight this. You have no idea what you're up against. ",
        "Kevin: I know exactly what I'm up against. ",
        "Ben: I'm not crazy. ",
        "Kevin: That's a matter of opinion. ",
        "Officer: Come on. ",
        "Andy: Nice curveball, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you for backing me up. ",
        "Andy: Yeah. But I'm not so sure that this psych thing is going to stick. I \r\nthink you just bought yourself a whole load of trouble. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I think all I bought myself was some time. Let's just hope it's \r\nenough. ",

        "Monica: We're all ready for her. ",
        "Ian: Monica, my wife's in bad shape. ",
        "Monica: I've been brought up to speed. We'll take care of her. ",
        "Ian: All right, I'll scrub in. ",
        "Monica: I'm sorry -- ",
        "Ian: She needs all the help she can get. ",
        "Monica: Dr. Thornhart, you know doctors don't operate on family. ",
        "Ian: I just want to be with her. ",
        "Monica: You can watch from the scrub room. ",
        "Ian: Please don't let her die. ",
        "Eve: We will take very good care of her, ok? ",
        "Chris: Oh, wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? ",
        "Eve: To assist. ",
        "Chris: No way. You guys are way too close to this. You need to back off. \r\nLook, don't worry. If anyone can save her, Dr. Quartermaine can. ",
        "",
        "Eve: They are the best surgeons. She's in good hands. They won't lose \r\nher. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I can't believe I -- I shouldn't have -- I -- hmm. ",
        "Eve: You shouldn't have been with me. We should have -- ",
        "Ian: I should have been with Arianna. I didn't have to come here to pick up \r\nher medical records. I could have sent for them. ",
        "Eve: No, you had to hide her identity. ",
        "Ian: No. The fact is I came here to see you. I came here to be with you. And, \r\nwhat, I couldn't spend an extra five or six hours watching over her? ",
        "Eve: We thought she was going to be ok. We thought she was going to be ok to \r\nstart her brand-new life! ",
        "Ian: Yeah, and now she -- now she might die because she needed me, and I \r\nwasn't there. ",

        "Lucy: You see, this truly was one of those cosmic universal accidents. I \r\ndidn't plan any of this on purpose. ",
        "Livvie: What, you just happened to see Chris with my diary? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I did, at the hospital. Pretty amazing, huh? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, real amazing. ",
        "Lucy: It was. You see, there he was, holding your very personal, very private \r\ndiary, and I thought that was highly suspicious. ",
        "Livvie: And -- and so, what, Lucy, did you follow him home? ",
        "Lucy: Um, not exactly. ",
        "Livvie: Then what, exactly? ",
        "Lucy: I -- I sort of got in there before he got there. You see, I figured the \r\nuniverse had put me there for a real, true purpose. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. So naturally you decided to spy on Chris. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, naturally. I mean -- come on, Livvie, he was spying on you. \r\nThat's bad. So that's when I decided I had to break in. ",
        "Livvie: You broke in? ",
        "Lucy: I let myself -- I was -- I was let in -- by the super. ",
        "Livvie: You paid him off, didn't you? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but it was for your own good. ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, why wouldn't you just come to me like any normal person would \r\nand tell me what was going on? ",
        "Lucy: I'm not normal? Livvie, you wouldn't believe me. Come on. You told me \r\nyou want to make your own decisions. That's what you want, right? ",
        "Livvie: All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. Please, just get \r\nback to the diary. Please. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, there we were in Chris' apartment, you know -- ",
        "Livvie: \"We?\" Hold on. Who is \"we?\" ",
        "Lucy: I didn't say \"we.\" I said \"me\" -- me, myself, and I, all alone in the \r\napartment. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Uh, Lucy, I am not buying. Who was with you? Don't tell me you \r\ngot my dad roped into this. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you see, forget all that. What you need to remember is your dad \r\nand me, we -- we were just trying to help you. So keep that word -- focus on \r\nhelp. H-e-l-p. That's the important operative word here. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I can't believe Kevin actually paid off the super to get into \r\nChris' penthouse! ",
        "Lucy: He didn't. I did. That wasn't his fault. He just followed me there, \r\nsee, and then Chris came home and we almost got caught when you guys came home, \r\nso we decided to hightail it out onto the terrace. ",
        "Livvie: You hid on the terrace? ",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah, yeah, until you both decided to go in the bedroom. And \r\nthat's when -- ",
        "Livvie: Oh, the smoke alarm. You set off the smoke alarm? ",
        "Lucy: No, I didn't. Your dad did. I thought that was very, very clever. It \r\nwas a great idea. In fact, it was a lot better than his first choice, which was \r\nto rip Chris from limb to limb. Come on, Livvie, that would have been bloody, \r\nmessy. Nothing but a lawsuit would have ensued. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, ok, so why are you here now? Lucy -- and don't tell me that my \r\ndad is hiding in my closet or something. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. Heavens, no. No, no. He doesn't know I'm here. I just -- I had \r\nto stop by to make sure you've seen the light, that you realize what a weasel \r\nChris really is. And I'm not going to stand here and apologize for trying to \r\nhelp you or say I did something bad when I'm just trying to show you what a \r\nloser -- he is the king of losers. ",
        "Livvie: Thank you, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Chris Ramsey is -- don't expect me to apologize because if you get mad \r\nat me, every time -- what did you say? ",

        "Eve: You have to stop beating yourself up about this. It's not going to help \r\nyou or Arianna, and believe me, there's enough blame to go around. ",
        "Chris: Set up the auto-transfuser. ",
        "Monica: There's too much blood. I'm having trouble seeing. Suction. ",

        "Eve: Yeah, of course you did. ",
        "Ian: I told Arianna to lock the door behind me, and she did. I told her not \r\nto open the door to anyone -- not to anyone. ",
        "Eve: No, Ian, it might be a while before we find out exactly what happened.\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah. I put all her stuff in a bag so I could throw it away, and there \r\nwas this scrapbook that she wanted, and I told her she couldn't have it. ",
        "Eve: Well, because you had to hide her identity. ",
        "Ian: One picture. That's all she wanted, one picture. ",
        "Eve: Listen, think of all the good you've done for Arianna, how much you've \r\nhelped her. ",

        "Ian: He tried to kill his own sister more than once. He cannot get away with \r\nthis, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: I threw a wrench into his plans. I've got him here on a 72-hour \r\npsychiatric hold. But I don't think it's going to stick. Which is why I wanted \r\nto warn you two. ",

        "Kevin: I've put in calls to everyone. Victor's checking his sources. Scott's \r\ntrying to find a legal loophole so we can prosecute Ben in this country, but, \r\nyes, he could walk. ",
