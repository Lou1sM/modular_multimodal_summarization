        "Karen: You know, it's incredible what you guys have done. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you don't see too many bike shops that look like this. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, it's all Ali, and she worked very, very hard. ",
        "Karen: Where'd you get the stuff, anyway? ",
        "Alison: Well, on our budget it was not easy, but I discovered this very cool \r\nnew thing -- a garage sale. They're awesome. Yeah. ",
        "Frank: I think I've heard of those. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: Well, you've done a fantastic job. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. I'm just glad that you guys finally got a chance to come \r\nover and see it. ",
        "Karen: Well, thanks for inviting us. It's nice to get out for a change. ",
        "Alison: So, who's ready for some hot apple pie? It's Jamal's mom's recipe and \r\nit is awesome. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Frank: Sounds great. ",
        "Alison: Ok, cool. It's just in the apartment, so I'm going to run and go get \r\nit. Be right back. ",
        "Jamal: So, Frank, how's that old computer coming? What, did I say something \r\n-- ",
        "Frank: Well, no, it's just -- ",
        "Karen: It's just that that old computer has turned Frank here into a \r\ncyber fiend from hell, and the last time I touched it it tried to kill me. Can \r\nyou pass the bread, please? ",
        "",
        "Alison: Livvie? Is that you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I was just trying to work up my nerve. ",
        "Alison: To do what? ",
        "Livvie: Tell Jack what a huge idiot I've been. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Whew. ",
        "Sam: Thanks again for the ride. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, no problem. ",
        "Sam: I can't believe Zack totally flaked on picking me up. ",
        "Jack: You said you needed to use the phone? ",
        "Sam: I'm in no hurry. So, this is your pad, huh? Right behind the bike shop?\r\n",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, it's not much, but, hey, you know, it works for me. ",
        "Sam: Oh, I think it's perfect. It's so cozy, you know? Just room enough for \r\ntwo. ",
        "Sam: I like you, Jack. ",
        "Jack: I like you, too. ",
        "Sam: So what do you say we take this to the next step? Actually, the next \r\ncouple of steps -- to your bed. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Why don't you sit down? You need some rest. ",
        "Eve: Oh, like I could really relax. If Arianna doesn't make it through this \r\nsurgery -- ",
        "Kevin: Try and think positive. Monica and Chris are doing everything they \r\ncan. ",
        "Eve: I know. It's just that Ian feels so guilty. He left her alone and he \r\ndidn't protect her from Ben. ",
        "Kevin: Eve, Ian couldn't possibly be there every minute, now, could he? ",
        "Eve: No, you don't understand. Ian shouldn't have been away so long. He \r\nshould've been there for her. ",
        "Kevin: Eve. ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. If Arianna dies, Ian will never forgive himself for what \r\nhappened. And I'll never forgive myself, either. ",
        "Kevin: Forgive yourself? For what? ",
        "Eve: While Arianna was being attacked, Ian and I were together. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Collins had you locked up in the psych ward. How'd you get out? ",
        "Ben: Do I look like an amateur? ",
        "Ian: All right. Let's get on with it. I'm here alone. ",
        "Ben: But we're not alone. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: So you're talking about this computer like it's -- like it's dangerous \r\nor something. ",
        "Frank: Jamal, maybe we shouldn't get into this. ",
        "Karen: Oh, no, no, no, Frank, why don't you tell him? Tell him about all the \r\nweird stuff it does, like how it connects with another computer without having \r\nany server. ",
        "Jamal: What? That's impossible. ",
        "Karen: Well, that's what our computer expert said. There is no way to send or \r\nreceive an e-mail on a computer built in 1973. ",
        "Jamal: But you are? ",
        "Karen: Oh, yeah, yeah, just by typing on the screen. ",
        "Frank: Karen -- ",
        "Karen: You know -- oh, you should also tell him about Cookie, a 16-year-old \r\nwe're getting technically impossible e-mails from. She's never heard of the \r\nInternet. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, so, what, she's been living in a cave. ",
        "Karen: Oh, maybe. She says she has no friends. ",
        "Frank: She is a very troubled girl. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, so, so -- what's this about the computer trying to kill you? ",
        "Karen: Well, when I finally decided enough and it was time to pull the plug \r\non old Nellie, she zapped me with enough volts to light up California. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa. That's some whacked-out machine you got there. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, well, tell Frank because he doesn't believe it. ",
        "",
        "Alison: So you're saying you want Jack back? ",
        "Livvie: No -- well, I'm just saying that I want to talk to him about -- about \r\nmaybe -- maybe getting back together. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I know I've been jerking him around some. Ok, ok, maybe a lot, \r\nbut things have changed. ",
        "Alison: Like what? ",
        "Livvie: Well, for one, I have finally seen Chris for who he really is -- a \r\nself-centered, manipulative, dishonest ass. ",
        "Alison: Hello, I have been trying to tell you that forever. ",
        "Livvie: I know. I know, you have, everyone has, but he was totally messing \r\nwith my head, and because of him, I almost lost the only guy I -- I now know \r\nthat I ever really wanted. ",
        "Alison: Jack. ",
        "Livvie: I just hope it's not too late. ",
        "Alison: No! Are you kidding? It's never too late. Oh, my God, I'm so excited \r\nbecause now we get to, like, double date -- ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no, no, no. Look, look, first, I need to talk to Jack. ",
        "Alison: Ok -- but he's not here right now. No, no, no. No, he'll be back any \r\nsecond. Why don't you wait for him? ",
        "Livvie: You think? ",
        "Alison: Oh, absolutely. I know that Jack will not want to miss getting the \r\nshock of his life. ",
        "",
        "Sam: You know, this could be a lot more fun if you helped. ",
        "Jack: I -- Sam -- don't take this the wrong way, but -- ",
        "Sam: Oh, man, I don't believe this. I -- I thought you were into girls. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I am. I am so much I even like to make the moves sometimes. ",
        "Sam: Sorry. ",
        "Jack: Hey, it's all right. Look, Sam, I really like you. It's just that I \r\nhave a feeling that this might complicate my life right now and believe me, I do \r\nnot need any more complications. So what do you say we just take it kind of \r\nslow? ",
        "Sam: Sure. Whatever you say. ",
        "Jack: Thanks for the compliment. ",
        "Sam: Ahem. See you around. ",
        "Jack: Definitely. ",

        "Eve: Ian told Arianna that he would just be gone for a little while, that he \r\nwas coming here to pick up her medical records and he'd be right back. And then \r\nhe ran into me. And one thing led to another. And I kept him here. I kept him from going back. ",
        "Kevin: Eve, what happened to Arianna is not your fault. It's not Ian's fault.\r\n",
        "Eve: You don't know! ",
        "Kevin: I do know. I saw what Ben did to her. I spoke to him. Believe me, he \r\nwas going to do this, no matter what. ",
        "Eve: I don't care. He still should have been with Arianna, not me. ",
        "Kevin: And if he had been, then we'd be wondering whether two innocent people \r\nwould live. ",
        "Eve: You always know just what to say to make me feel better. ",
        "Kevin: All I ever wanted was for you to be happy. And I still want that. ",
        "[Pager beeps] ",
        "Kevin: Psych ward. ",
        "Eve: Is it Ben? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. Are you going to be ok here? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I'll be ok. Arianna's going to be in surgery for hours. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. See you later. ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. Ian, how are we going to make this right? Oh, I need some air.\r\n",

        "Ben: I am tired of your interfering, Thornhart. It's over. ",
        "Ian: What are you going to do with that? ",
        "Ian: How's it feel? Huh? How's it feel when someone else has your life in their hands? That's how \r\nyour sister felt for the last month! ",
        "Ben: Yeah, go on, kill me. Push me! Come on, huh? You can't because you're \r\npathetic and you're weak, just like that whore wife of yours. Oh! Ooh! ",
        "Eve: Ian! Oh! Ian! ",
        "Ben: Go ahead, say goodbye to your girlfriend, brother-in-law! ",

        "Alison: Uh-oh. What did I miss? ",
        "Jamal: It's my fault. I sort of opened a can of worms. ",
        "Frank: No, no, no, no. Karen and I have been going 'round and 'round about \r\nthis for a while. ",
        "Karen: You could say that again. ",
        "Frank: So, hey, yeah, next time, dinner at my place, ok? ",

        "Jamal: Don't blame me. Blame Nellie, ok? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: Nellie, that freaky old computer that Frank keeps in the garage. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Yeah, I should go, too. ",
        "Alison: Wait. You're not chickening out, are you? No, no, you can't. Jack's \r\ngoing to be back any second. I know it. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, Alison, I just really think that -- ",
        "Alison: Livvie, look -- that's your problem, you think too much. ",
        "Livvie: That's what Jack says. ",

        "Alison: Yeah, um, but it -- ",
        "Jack: Good, then I can get some more work done on this bike. ",

        "Frank: Karen -- ",
        "Karen: Listen to me, Frank. I need you to be able to walk away, to just \r\ncompletely break free of what's become this entity in our lives. And the fact \r\nthat you can't, it scares me. ",
