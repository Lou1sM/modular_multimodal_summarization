        "After coming home from the hospital, Lucy continues to vent her anger about Ian's deadly plan. Casey's concern for Lucy arouses Alison's suspicions that the angel has inside information. Karen confronts Frank about his gambling problem after hearing him promise to come up with the money. Frank explains that he's trying to help his mother keep the restaurant afloat, and he turns down Karen's offer to help. After making love to Lucy, Ian promises to fight for his life. Alison is somewhat embarrassed but unapologetic when confronted by her mother, who spent a very long time locked in the bathroom before removing the doorknob to escape. Alison fills Elizabeth in on Caleb's newfound humanity and Joshua's treachery. Elizabeth believes that Caleb needs her now that he's human again, but she doesn't believe that Joshua poses any threat to her. Rafe stops Joshua from making another murder attempt on Caleb. When three young hospital volunteers come to Caleb's room for an autograph, Joshua takes one of the girls hostage, releasing her only to give himself the chance to flee. Caleb has the other girls release him from his restraints. After making a show of being unable to defend himself should Joshua return, Caleb slips out of the restraints and sneaks out of his room. Unaware that Caleb is lurking nearby, Alison informs Rafe that her mother is still obsessed with Caleb. Kevin is overjoyed by Livvie's return, but he's stunned to learn that she willingly became a vampire. He promises to help his daughter, who is devastated by her loss and terrified for her safety. Joshua goes to the lighthouse and orders Kevin to let him see Livvie."

        "Alison: Why are you so worried about Lucy?",
        "Casey: Hmm. No, no, no, no, I'm not worried. I was just asking. And you guys are really close, right? And the doctor said she was ok? I mean, she's definitely --",
        "Alison: Well, yeah, I mean, they said that she got pretty banged up, you know, in the fight, but you should really know that by now.",
        "Casey: No, I -- I don't know everything. She's cool people. I really like Lucy.",
        "Alison: Casey?",
        "Casey: Hmm?",
        "Alison: Do you know something that you're not saying?",
        "Casey: Girl, do I look like a doctor to you?",
        "[Casey laughs]",
        "Casey: No, I said I'm just concerned, ok, because she's one cool crime- fighting chick.",
        "Alison: Well, she was really brave.",
        "Casey: Yeah. She definitely scored big for the big guys. Good guys.",
        "Alison: Yeah, this time. So what are the chances that we all live happily ever after? You know, I mean, once this last vampire bites the dust?",
        "Casey: I wish I could tell you as an angel or as a friend. All I know is that in every war, there's bound to be some casualties.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: All right. Let's get you to bed.",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Ian: No? Well, you had quite an ordeal and you promised you'd lay down for a minute.",
        "Lucy: Oh. I absolutely did not promise any such thing. In fact, I'm not tired at all.",
        "Ian: All right. What about something to eat? What do you fancy? I'll make it for you.",
        "Lucy: I fancy honesty, for starters.",
        "Ian: Lucy, come on.",
        "Lucy: No, no, \"come on.\" No. I read -- I read this. You said goodbye.",
        "Ian: We discussed this already.",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Ian: And --",
        "Lucy: Was I -- was Isupposed to read this after you were dead? Do you understand? I was supposed to read that and you'd be dead.",
        "Ian: I don't want to discuss this anymore.",
        "Lucy: I do. You -- no. I need to talk about this. I don't care what you write. I don't care what you say. You're not going anywhere without me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Daddy?",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I need -- I need your help.",

        "Alison: Hey, Frank, can you put extra mustard on my sandwich?",
        "Frank: Uh, yeah. Is he meeting you here?",
        "Alison: No, I'm going to take it back to the hospital.",
        "Frank: Well, sit down, make yourself comfortable. It might take a while.",
        "Alison: Are you sure? Because it looks a little --",
        "Frank: I know, I know. Business has been slow. I've had to cut back in the kitchen. It's just me and Bob.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Frank: Ah. Recovery room. Yeah. Look, you will get your money. Don't worry. Ok? I got to go.",
        "Karen: So, when were you going to tell me you started gambling again?",
        "Alison: Oh, God. Mother, I'm so sorry. I forgot.",
        "Elizabeth: You forgot? You locked me in the bathroom? How do you forget --",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Elizabeth: Locking your mother in the bathroom?",
        "Alison: I've just been a little preoccupied lately.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, well, so have I.",
        "Alison: How'd you get out, anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: What do you want?",
        "Joshua: Do you want to guess?",
        "Caleb: You failed on your first attempt to kill me, so you're here to finish the job.",
        "Joshua: Yeah, but this time I'm really going to enjoy it. I'm going to get to watch it. I'm going to get to feel the life draining out of you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rafe: Vampire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: \"There's only one way to get back my life I once knew. That's to feed -- to take another human being and destroy their life by drinking their blood. I can't do it, Lucy. I can't perpetuate this horror.\"",
        "Ian: There's more.",
        "Lucy: I know very well there's more. The entire thing is seared into my brain, especially the part where you made that horrible pact, that agreement with Rafe -- when every vampire is destroyed or cured, he's to kill you.",
        "Ian: I only asked him to do what he was born to do, and that was right.",
        "Lucy: Why didn't you come to me? Why didn't -- you didn't even ask me. You didn't even come to me. You didn't talk to me about this. You would just be dead and gone forever, and all I would have would be this -- this piece of paper.",
        "Ian: Did you read the rest of it?",
        "Lucy: I don't care.",
        "Ian: Well, I care. Because it says that I love you and that I love my son and that I love my life with you, and that I can't --",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. What you can't do is you can't give up on yourself, and you can't give up on us because of this. You can't forget what we have. We have our magic.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: This isn't a good time.",
        "Karen: Oh, believe me, there will never be a good time to talk about your gambling.",
        "Frank: Look, you're blowing this all out of proportion.",
        "Elizabeth: Excuse me, Frank. Could I order something over here, please?",
        "Karen: Take care of your customer.",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you. I would like a couple of poached eggs with toast, dry. Some sliced tomatoes, a fruit plate, and some coffee, please.",
        "Frank: All right, got it.",
        "Elizabeth: And I'll have a cosmopolitan while I'm waiting. So there I was locked in the bathroom with -- for God knows how long because, you know, there's no clocks in there. There's no phone. There's no food. Absolutely no literature, and toothpaste is not classified as a food group, either.",
        "Alison: Ok. Are you finished?",
        "Elizabeth: No. I want to know why you did that. Why did you lock me in the bathroom?",
        "Alison: Listen, honestly, we had a lot of things to do, and I didn't want you to get in the way.",
        "Elizabeth: Hey. Did I hear you say \"I'm sorry\" in there anywhere?",
        "Alison: No. And you won't.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, Alison, I have just -- I've been under a bit of stress lately.",
        "Alison: Why don't you take a number and stand in line? We all have.",
        "[Elizabeth sighs]",
        "Elizabeth: Well, at least tell me it was worth it. I mean, what happened? Were you guys successful? Did you get rid of all the vampires?",
        "Alison: Well, Joshua did blow up the hot spring, and then he disappeared. Although, Caleb did get injured.",
        "Elizabeth: Injured? How -- how can he be injured?",
        "Alison: Because he's not a vampire anymore.",
        "Elizabeth: Really? Really? So no -- no fangs, no power. Oh, my poor little husband. All alone with absolutely nothing, except me, of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Is it really you?",
        "Livvie: I'm so sorry.",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God.",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry.",
        "Kevin: Livvie, you have nothing to be sorry for. All I wanted was for you to be home safe. How did you -- how did you get out from Tess?",
        "Livvie: I will -- I will tell you everything, I promise. I'm just really tired, and there's some things I need to know.",
        "Kevin: Ok. What?",
        "Livvie: What happened in Port Charles with the vampires?",
        "Kevin: I -- I don't know what you mean.",
        "Livvie: They said they killed Caleb, and you're the only one I can trust, daddy. I need to know. Please, you have to tell me the truth. Please.",
        "Kevin: Well, I heard Lucy ranting about getting Caleb and the others.",
        "Livvie: Oh, no. He's really gone. Oh, my God, they're going to come after me next.",
        "Kevin: No. They wouldn't. Why would they -- you're one of them. You're a vampire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Rafe. I believe visiting is for blood relatives only.",
        "Rafe: That's funny.",
        "Joshua: Well, never mind. We're always up for a good party, aren't we?",
        "[Teens laugh excitedly]",
        "teen: I told you! It's Stephen Clay. They're using some other name on your chart, but I knew it was just a disguise.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it's me.",
        "Teen: Are you sick?",
        "Caleb: I'm a little under the weather, but I'll be feeling like myself real soon.",
        "Teen: Aw. Well, can you sign this for us, please?",
        "Caleb: Sure.",
        "Teen: Thanks.",
        "Rafe: Wait, Joshua, don't!",
        "Caleb: Would one of you be willing to do me a favor?",
        "Rafe: Joshua --",
        "Joshua: Back off, slayer. You know what I'm capable of.",
        "Rafe: Ok. I hear you. All right, just let her go.",
        "Joshua: And then what?",
        "Teen: What's happening?",
        "Rafe: You're going to be ok. Are you ok? Ok. Oh, Caleb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: This doesn't make sense.",
        "Lucy: It makes perfect sense, because we both know that this is the best way to get rid of your symptoms. So if we have to make love five, 10, 20 times a day, that's what we're going to do. And if you complain at all, I will be deeply, deeply insulted.",
        "Ian: I'm not complaining, but you're talking about 20 times a day. I don't know.",
        "Lucy: This is what we have to do. This is so you can live your life -- and we can live our lives together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: He turned you into one of them.",
        "Kevin: I always knew this was possible, but I guess I -- I guess I hoped against hope. Caleb is dead?",
        "Livvie: But I can still feel him. You know when you have that incredible connection to someone?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, because he turned you into a vampire.",
        "Livvie: No, dad, I wanted this. I wanted this just as much as he did. It was the only way we could be together, and I begged him not to leave. I did. But he knew they were killing the other vampires, and he had to try and save them.",
        "Kevin: That must be why Ian was so determined to get away from me. Livvie, the hot spring -- there's a cure.",
        "Livvie: No, no, dad, it's gone. Rafe and Lucy blew it up.",
        "Kevin: Why would they do that?",
        "Livvie: There's no fix for this. I've been turned, and I don't know how to live this way without Caleb, dad.",
        "Kevin: No, honey, we'll figure it out.",
        "Livvie: Dad, he'll destroy me.",
        "Kevin: No! They won't touch you as long as I can draw breath.",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I'm so scared. I am so afraid. Please, you have to help me, daddy. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: So what do you know? I lose two pounds, and my husband is suddenly mortal. Hmm. Day's not turning out to be so bad after all.",
        "Alison: No, listen. He's not your husband.",
        "Elizabeth: Yes, he is, Alison. We were married.",
        "Alison: I know that. But he just used you. Livvie is the one he's always wanted.",
        "Elizabeth: Why do you always feel like everybody's using me?",
        "Alison: Because you make it so easy. I mean, first there was Caleb, then Joshua. They both turned on you.",
        "Elizabeth: Joshua is grateful to me.",
        "Alison: What fantasy world do you live in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey. It was only a couple of poker games. Don't make a federal case out of it.",
        "Karen: A federal case?",
        "Frank: While you're busy working 90 hours a week, a guy gets restless.",
        "Karen: Oh, great. Make this my fault. You've been a no-show three times this week. Victor is worried out of his mind that he can't count on you.",
        "Frank: Look, what I do is my business.",
        "Karen: You think your gambling has no effect on me?",
        "Frank: You're right. Karen, I'm sorry. But I swear to you, this is no big deal. I'm only down a couple hundred bucks.",
        "Karen: You know, it's bad enough you're a gambler. Now you're a liar, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: No, what I'm saying is that Joshua got what he wanted. He won. There's no reason for him to come after me and drag me off to his little pied- a-terre at columbus manor ever again. And if I happen to run into Caleb somewhere, sometime --",
        "Alison: No. No, no, no. No, listen to me. You cannot run into any of them, not Caleb, not Joshua, nobody. I want you to go back to my apartment and wait for me to call you, please. And take this doorknob, put it back on.",
        "Elizabeth: So you're really afraid something's going to happen to me?",
        "Alison: Yes, I am.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok. You win. I'll go. And you'll be happy to know, I'm not mad at you anymore.",
        "Alison: Here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colleen: Hey! This is a hospital, not Madison Square Garden.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, sorry.",
        "Colleen: Yeah. Listen, I'm really sorry about those girls earlier.",
        "Caleb: Actually, they were all very sweet.",
        "Colleen: Well, there's a time and a place.",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry.",
        "Colleen: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: Used me as bait and still you couldn't get Joshua.",
        "Rafe: Don't worry, I will.",
        "Caleb: He won't be satisfied until I'm dead.",
        "Rafe: Probably, yeah.",
        "Caleb: Quite a dilemma for you -- having to protect me. And your job wouldn't be so hard if I wasn't such a sitting duck. Maybe untie me, at least give me a chance to defend myself?",
        "Rafe: You mean untie you so you can find Livvie again so she can turn you.",
        "Caleb: There's a clever little idea.",
        "Rafe: I'll be arranging for security now. The great Stephen Clay won't be receiving visitors any time soon.",
        "Caleb: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I can't believe you called me a liar.",
        "Karen: I got a call at home, Frank. You're in very deep.",
        "Frank: I was trying to save this place. It would kill my mom if it went under.",
        "Karen: Well, I have some money put aside.",
        "Frank: I won't take your money. I didn't even want to hear about it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You make me believe that anything's possible.",
        "Lucy: I need you to promise me something, and we're not getting off this couch until you do.",
        "Ian: I promise to love you.",
        "Lucy: Hmm, you're getting warm.",
        "Ian: I promise not to make any decisions about our lives without consulting you first.",
        "Lucy: That's very nice, and you're getting much, much warmer.",
        "Ian: I promise that I will fight for my life and for us with every breath in my body.",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Tell the guard that no one's allowed to see Mr. Clay without a doctor's permission.",
        "Colleen: Ok, I'll take care of it right away.",
        "Alison: Oh, no -- what? What happened?",
        "Rafe: I was this close to getting Joshua, and he got away.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Rafe: He took a hostage, one of Stephen Clay's fans.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, is she ok?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, she's fine. Where you been? You've been gone a long time.",
        "Alison: Oh, I know.",
        "Rafe: You ok, or what?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm fine. Guess what I forgot.",
        "Rafe: No idea. What?",
        "Alison: My mother.",
        "Rafe: I left her locked in the bathroom.",
        "Alison: Yeah, we did. And she finally got out. She took the doorknob off.",
        "Rafe: I guess she wasn't that happy, huh?",
        "Alison: No, she wasn't. But I think more than that, I think she's still obsessed with Caleb.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, we can use handcuffs next time.",
        "Alison: Yeah, maybe. Something like that. But I finally convinced her to go home and lay low until we contact her, which is really the same thing that I want to try and do with you.",
        "Rafe: All right, well, here's the thing. I -- I just -- I got Caleb under wraps. I just want to get Joshua.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Rafe: So the job will be done.",
        "Alison: I know, and you will. I have no doubt about that. But first, I really think that you should eat something and at least take a -- like, a nap for just 10 minutes. I mean, we're forgetting that we were almost killed, and we haven't even taken one second to appreciate each other. So, please, just say you'll come home with me.",
        "Rafe: Ok, just for a bit. All right?",
        "Alison: Ok. I'll take that, ok?",
        "Rafe: All right.",
        "Alison: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Well, fancy meeting you here. Looks like it's my lucky day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: How did this happen to us? To Caleb and me.",
        "Kevin: Honey, all that matters now is that you're here, and we'll figure a way to make it better.",
        "Livvie: I don't know how.",
        "Kevin: Well, that's what you have a father for -- to help you work these things out.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Kevin: Hide in the other room. I'll get rid of whoever it is.",
        "Joshua: Let me in, Collins. Where is she?",
        "Kevin: I don't know who you're talking about.",
        "Joshua: I need to see Livvie. Don't be a fool.",

        "Caleb: What do you want?",
        "Elizabeth: You're going to listen to every word I have to say.",
        "Rafe: I've off my game, and it's putting everyone in danger.",
        "Joshua: Where is Livvie?",
        "Kevin: Don't you mean Tess?",
        "Joshua: You've wasted enough of my time. Don't make me kill you."
