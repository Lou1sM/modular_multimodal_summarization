        "Karen: I just dropped by to tell you my mom's coming over and once again, \r\nI've made way too much chili. ",
        "Frank: Never too much chili. ",
        "Karen: Imagine my surprise to find you here. ",
        "Frank: Karen, this isn't what it looks like. ",
        "Karen: Romancing the computer? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know I promised to stay away, but I was -- ",
        "Karen: But you couldn't. ",
        "Frank: No, I was just unplugging it so Neil wouldn't get zapped like you did.\r\n",
        "Karen: So what are you waiting for? Unplug it already. ",
        "Frank: I did. ",
        "Karen: Are you sure? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, of course. I'm sure. See? ",
        "Karen: Then what is this message doing there? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Arianna? Can you hear me? ",
        "Ian: Eve? She squeezed my hand. Did you see that? ",
        "Eve: Good. That's -- that's good. ",
        "Ian: I'm right here. I'm not leaving you. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. ",
        "",
        "Frank: \"Frank, are you there? I'm waiting to hear from you. Why don't you \r\ntalk to me anymore? Did I do something wrong? Did I make your girlfriend \r\njealous?\" The damn thing is unplugged. How am I getting these messages? ",
        "Karen: Ok, now I'm officially creeped out. ",
        "Frank: Well, there's got to be some kind of an explanation for this. ",
        "Karen: You know what? I really don't think we should have anything more to do \r\nwith this computer or your little cyber pal. ",
        "Frank: Karen -- Karen, wait. The girl asked us for help. She's obviously \r\nupset at not hearing from us. ",
        "Karen: No, you. She wants to hear from you. ",
        "Frank: I can't just stop talking to her without letting her know why, so I've \r\ngot a plan. ",
        "Karen: Let me guess -- you're going to adopt her? ",
        "Frank: I'm going to find out what town she lives in and hook her up with a \r\nreal, live counselor there. Ok? Look, I'm just -- I'm just trying to give a \r\nscrewed-up kid a little help. Ok? ",
        "Karen: Well, do what you have to, then. I better get back home before my mom \r\nstarts rearranging all my furniture again. ",
        "Frank: Hey, don't go away mad. All right? Just let me find Cookie someone to \r\ntalk to. Then it'll be off my mind and my conscience. ",
        "Karen: Right. ",
        "Frank: Hey. We're still going steady, right? I mean, I did give you my class \r\nring. ",
        "Karen: You know, you're really pushing it, Scanlon. ",
        "Frank: Hmm. Now that's more like it. ",
        "Karen: When you tell Cookie goodbye, make sure she knows I'm not jealous. ",
        "Frank: Oh. You've got no reason to worry -- none. ",
        "",
        "Jack: I am so sorry about you finding Sam in my bed. I told her to get lost, \r\nbut she would not take no for an answer. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack. I jumped to conclusions. I just -- I wanted to find you \r\nbecause I had to talk to you. Chris and I are over. ",
        "Jack: That's a good thing, right? ",
        "Livvie: And you have way too many clothes on. ",
        "Jack: All that matters is that you're here and we're together. ",
        "Livvie: Were you saying something? ",
        "Jack: Oh, I see -- you're trying to make me forget what I was saying. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Is that a bad thing? ",
        "Jack: No, no, but I want to tell you something -- Livvie, I love you. I have \r\nloved you for a long time. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Jack, I love you, too. ",
        "",
        "Ian: You're safe. ",
        "Ian: We have to get you better. And that means you're going to have to fight. \r\nAnd I know you know how to do that. But you're not going to be alone. I'll fight \r\nright alongside with you. All right? ",
        "Ian: I never should've left you. But I won't leave you now. I won't leave \r\nyou. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Hey. There you are. Well, I thought I'd catch you up on the latest \r\ngossip in this hospital and it just so happens to be about yours truly. Livvie \r\nand I are officially over, and don't say it. I know what you always thought \r\nabout it. But, hey, I may not have the girl, but I still have the gin, the \r\nvermouth, and the olives. Hey. No reason to get that upset over it. ",
        "Eve: Sorry. ",
        "Chris: It's ok. What's up? ",
        "Eve: It's my fault that Arianna was attacked. ",
        "Chris: What? How could it be your fault? ",
        "Eve: You ever been in the wrong place at the wrong time? ",
        "Chris: The story of my life. ",
        "Eve: While Arianna was being attacked, Ian and I were here, in this bed. ",
        "Chris: You had no way of knowing. ",
        "Eve: While Arianna was fighting for her life, we were lying here like there \r\nwasn't a care in the world. ",
        "Chris: Eve, come on. You can't spend your life regretting your actions. ",
        "Eve: You know what? Ian and I could've done something about this. We could've \r\nprevented this attack. Ian could've saved her life. ",
        "Chris: So, what, you want to -- you want to beat yourself up over it? ",
        "Eve: It's my fault that this happened. If Ian hadn't been with me, if he had \r\nbeen where he was supposed to be -- ",
        "Chris: Oh, instead he was with the woman he loved. You're going to punish \r\nyourself over that? ",
        "Eve: You know what? He was saying he was coming here to get medical records, \r\nhe would be right back. ",
        "Chris: No, Eve -- ",
        "Eve: He should've just gone home like he was supposed to go. ",
        "Chris: Eve, Ben was crazy. Yeah, he would've found a way to get to Arianna, \r\none way or the other, somehow. ",
        "Eve: God. What were we thinking? Forget it, forget it. I know exactly what we \r\nwere thinking. We were thinking about ourselves and to hell with the \r\nconsequences. ",
        "Chris: You're being way too hard on yourself. ",
        "Eve: No. Arianna could die because of us. ",
        "",
        "Karen: We'll sort through all your stuff in here and label it. We'll make a \r\nsave-it and a toss-it pile. ",
        "Rhonda: Ok. Frank's not coming over tonight? ",
        "Karen: He's busy, with a friend. ",
        "Rhonda: Hmm. ",
        "Karen: So I guess it's girls' night. ",
        "Rhonda: Gosh! I haven't looked through this stuff in years. ",
        "Karen: Ok. I never figured you for the lava lamp type. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, I was very hip in my day. ",
        "Karen: Save? ",
        "Rhonda: No, no. Throw it as far as you can see. ",
        "Karen: Ok. Ditto for the Partridge Family lunch box? ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, no, no, no. You got to save that. That is definitely a \r\ncollectors' item. I don't know if you knew that, but I've heard that. ",
        "Karen: Mom, is something wrong? ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, this doesn't belong to me. It belongs to your Aunt Carolyn. ",
        "Karen: She was your older sister, right? ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah. Um -- I can't believe I saved all this stuff. I guess I \r\ncouldn't bear to throw it away after she died. ",
        "Karen: She died a long time ago, didn't she? ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, before you were even born. ",
        "Karen: You know, you never really talked about her much, and I haven't even \r\nseen a picture of her. What was she like? ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, God, I adored her, you know? She was the big sister everyone \r\nwanted. You know, you were named after her. ",
        "Karen: What? Explain that. You never told me. ",
        "Rhonda: Well, I guess I couldn't pronounce her name, you know, when I was a \r\nlittle kid, so I said \"Carewyn.\" ",
        "Karen: I never knew that. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah. I miss her to this day. I actually can still hear her \r\nlaugh. Boy, she died too early. You know what? Maybe we should just take a nice \r\nbreak. ",
        "Karen: Well -- hey, how about some of that chili? ",
        "Rhonda: You know what? I think I'm going to go out and get some air. ",

        "Frank: Amazing. \"Karen got a shock, too. Maybe it's best we stop using the \r\ncomputer. Don't contact each other anymore.\" ",
        "Frank: \"I will get you professional help for your trouble. Where do you live? \r\nI'll search the Internet for a counselor.\" I hope I didn't scare her off. \"You \r\nsound nice, Frank. But I feel weird telling you where I live.\" \"Just the city. \r\nThat's all. Let me help you because this is the last time we can communicate.\"\r\n",

        "Ian: You get your rest, Arianna. Get your rest. I think I figured out what \r\nhappened that night. You left the apartment to find that scrapbook, didn't you? \r\nThe one I threw in the trash. You've really come to love this place, haven't \r\nyou? Well, you can live your life right here. You can stay in Port Charles. And \r\nI'll stay with you. I'll help you through this. I'm not going to let you down, \r\nnot this time. ",

        "Jack: It's pretty neat. ",

        "Livvie: How could I blame her for throwing herself at you? ",
        "Jack: Well, it didn't matter because I could not get my mind off you. Because \r\nbelieve me, I tried. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know. I mean, all the time I was with Chris, I tried so hard \r\nto forget about you, but I kept wanting you. Even when I was so mad at you, I -- \r\nI still wanted you. But then Chris -- ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey. What do you say we make a deal? The two of us will never \r\nmention the names Chris or Sam ever again. Huh? ",

        "Ian: It was a lot easier on the island, wasn't it? ",
        "Eve: Do you wonder if this is what's meant by destiny -- that in two \r\nlifetimes, we died and so now we're responsible for almost killing someone? Does \r\nthat make sense? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. But all the times we lived and loved, we lost each other, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Eve: So are we destined to cause unhappiness? Is that what the chief was \r\ntrying to tell us? ",

        "Eve: Oh. I wish there was something we could do instead of just standing \r\naround feeling guilty. ",
