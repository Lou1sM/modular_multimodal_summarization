        "When Rafe tells Alison that being happy may be the reason he's lost his edge, she lays into him about his attitude. Elizabeth corners Caleb at the hospital and lets off some steam about the way he treated her. After Caleb manages to regain her trust with promises of a life together, he enlists her help sneaking him out of the hospital. Although Caleb promises to meet her in the parking lot, Elizabeth is stunned when he actually takes off in a medevac helicopter. Livvie stops Joshua from killing her father. Joshua maintains that Caleb is dead, now adding that his body has been cremated, but Livvie insists that she can still feel her lover's presence. After a lead from Alison about Columbus Manor, Rafe heads out to look for Joshua. When Joshua won't give up on trying to talk Livvie into going with him, Kevin invites him to stay at the lighthouse. After seeing Kevin's fascinating painting, Joshua takes him up on the offer. While Rafe breaks into Joshua's place, Alison shows up at Kevin's door."

        "Alison: I just want you to take five minutes and at least eat something. If you don't slow down for just a little bit, you're going to fall over.",
        "Rafe: No, I'm fine.",
        "Alison: No, you're not fine.",
        "Rafe: I screwed up, ok?",
        "Alison: Well, I got extra mustard sandwich.",
        "Rafe: Mustard, that's good. That should make the world a safer place to live",
        "Alison: And I'm sure sarcasm will make it even better, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I screwed up! All right? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to be happy about that? Is that what you want?",
        "Alison: Can't you to stop talking about it.",
        "Rafe: I had Joshua. I had him! He was in front of me, and I let him get away!",
        "Alison: It wasn't your fault.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it was! I'm off my game, and it's putting everyone in danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: My dear, sweet husband.",
        "Caleb: Elizabeth --",
        "Elizabeth: I actually had to see you with my own eyes. Here you are, stripped of all your a little beat up, but -- poor baby.",
        "Caleb: I don't have time for this.",
        "Elizabeth: Don't you dare walk away from me, or I will scream so loud that every nurse, orderly, and security guard will come running. And by the looks of how you're sneaking around here, I don't think that's really what you want, do you?",
        "Caleb: What do you want?",
        "Elizabeth: You're going to stand here, and you're going to listen to every word I have to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: I will ask you one more time. Where is Livvie?",
        "Kevin: Don't you mean Tess?",
        "Joshua: I'm in no mood for your games, Dr. Collins.",
        "Kevin: Games? You think I'm playing a game? I finally got my daughter back with that music box, and then Caleb destroyed it. That was the last chance I had to get my daughter back.",
        "Joshua: You'd be an effective liar if you were talking to anybody but me.",
        "Kevin: Well, if she's back, then shouldn't you be telling me where she is?",
        "Joshua: You've wasted enough of my time. Don't make me kill you.",
        "Livvie: Let him alone! Let my father go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe, you are not putting people in danger.",
        "Rafe: Oh, no? Letting Joshua get away -- that's a pretty good start.",
        "Alison: You did everything that you could.",
        "Rafe: If I did that, Joshua wouldn't still be here. I mean, I let him distract me.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? He took a teenager hostage. If you didn't turn your back on him, they would have killed her. You did the right thing. Don't you see that?",
        "Rafe: The right thing? The right thing would have been to just be on him from the beginning.",
        "Alison: What are you saying?",
        "Rafe: I mean, I've been so focused on trying to get Caleb that I let Joshua get away with whatever he wanted to right under my nose.",
        "Alison: Ok. Rafe, if you really want to be mad at someone, be mad at my mother. I mean, she knew what Joshua was up to all along, and she never even said one word to us.",
        "Rafe: Your mother? What am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to count on your mother for help now? Alison, I'm a vampire slayer. I've been trained since day one to be able to anticipate what a vampire's going to do. If I can't do that, I can't protect people",
        "Alison: Ok, I don't know why you're getting so mad at me, but look at all the people that you have protected, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: This never would have happened before. I would have seen Joshua coming from a mile away!",
        "Alison: Oh. So what is it that you're saying?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. It just -- it feels like I got soft or something, like -- like maybe somehow being happy -- being happy made me lose my edge.",
        "Alison: Being happy made you lose your edge? Ok, I'm sorry. Am I a distraction to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Dad! Dad, are you all right?",
        "Kevin: I'm fine.",
        "Livvie: What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?",
        "Joshua: I'm sorry. I was overcome with worry.",
        "Livvie: Sorry you were going to kill my father?",
        "Joshua: It would not have come to that.",
        "Livvie: That's no excuse!",
        "Joshua: You're absolutely right. Please accept my apologies.",
        "Kevin: Get away from me.",
        "Joshua: I was very worried when I realized you weren't in our hiding place. I thought perhaps the slayers had found you.",
        "Livvie: So you came after my father?",
        "Joshua: No, I was concerned, perhaps in case they had co-opted you in some way. Why did you leave our hiding place?",
        "Livvie: I needed to talk to my father. And I know he wouldn't betray me.",
        "Joshua: I wish you would have told me.",
        "Kevin: Well, that's not your concern anymore. I'm protecting my daughter now.",
        "Joshua: No disrespect, Dr. Collins. You don't know the entire story.",
        "Livvie: I told him everything.",
        "Joshua: Everything?",
        "Kevin: Everything. I know what she is, and I'll take care of her.",
        "Joshua: Then you know the slayers are after us and they'll do anything to kill us?",
        "Livvie: I really don't care about that right now. I just want to know about Caleb.",
        "Joshua: Well, you should care, Livvie. The slayers are out to kill us. I've just experienced firsthand how far they'll go.",
        "Livvie: What happened?",
        "Joshua: I know you believe you can still feel Caleb. I went to the hospital to see if I could find his body.",
        "Livvie: And the body wasn't there, right? I mean, Caleb isn't dead.",
        "Joshua: They want us dead, Livvie. I ran into Rafe. I barely escaped with my life.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, ok. What -- what about Caleb?",
        "Joshua: They really wanted to make sure he was dead this time. They've cremated him.",
        "Livvie: No. No, that -- that's not true. You must have made a mistake.",
        "Joshua: No. Caleb is dead. There's nothing left of him.",
        "Livvie: That can't be. I still feel his presence even stronger. I mean, I -- I swear, daddy. I feel it. I feel his presence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I can walk by myself, thank you.",
        "Caleb: Go ahead, I'm listening.",
        "Elizabeth: Don't rush me. Ok, you may have had the privilege of acting however you want and treating people however you pleased because you have been big master vampire. But not anymore because that's not going to work because now you're just a regular guy. You don't have power over me anymore.",
        "Caleb: I never thought what we had had anything to do with power.",
        "Elizabeth: You made me believe that you loved me. You married me, and then you just -- you just disposed of me, like I was just garbage left over from yesterday.",
        "Caleb: I never intended to hurt you.",
        "Elizabeth: Hurt me? God, you destroyed me, you turned me into a monster, and then you left me all alone just to deal with that by myself.",
        "Caleb: Eliza --",
        "Elizabeth: Just don't -- I am not finished yet. I gave up everything for you, but you -- you were too blind to even see that, weren't you? You are the most arrogant, self-absorbed, obsessive bastard that I have ever met. And I hope to God you are miserable now that you're all alone and you're powerless.",
        "Caleb: I can see how much pain I have caused you. And if I could take back every moment of it, I would.",
        "Elizabeth: You don't mean that.",
        "Caleb: Yes, I do. I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Elizabeth: All you ever wanted was Olivia -- or Livvie. You even settled for Tess over me. You gave up everything that we could have had because of your stupid obsession. And look where it left you.",
        "Caleb: You're right.",
        "Elizabeth: What?",
        "Caleb: The obsession from my past ruined my future. Look where it left me.",
        "Elizabeth: At least you're not dead. You're just human.",
        "Caleb: It's strange. Because my needs -- my needs now are completely different.",
        "Elizabeth: How?",
        "Caleb: They're all different, starting with that insane obsession with Olivia.",
        "Elizabeth: Do you really expect me to believe that you're over that now?",
        "Caleb: All I can say is, I'm just not blinded by that -- that need for her.",
        "Elizabeth: Good for you.",
        "Caleb: But even more important, more painful --",
        "Elizabeth: What?",
        "Caleb: I can see the destruction I caused for everyone. Especially you.",
        "Elizabeth: I don't believe you.",
        "Caleb: I don't blame you. I haven't given you much reason to have faith in me. You and I both know what we had together. Now that's gone forever. And that's the real tragedy in all this, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: What are you saying?",
        "Caleb: What I'm saying is I'm sorry. Losing you is my biggest regret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You're not really saying that you'd be better at your calling if you were less happy, right? Because that's probably got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard you say.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Alison: No, listen to me, Rafe. You are a wonderful slayer. You're the best in the world. And one of the qualities that makes you that good is that you use your heart in everything that you do. And I think that you know that. I'm not really sure why you're arguing with me about isis.",
        "Rafe: I'm not trying to. I'm not. That's not what I'm trying to say --",
        "Alison: You are allowed to be happy. You are. I don't know why you're beating yourself up because you're trying to be in every single place at once. You know, you can't. All you can do is the best you can do in any given situation. I mean it, you get that?",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Because, Rafe, I love you, but I don't want you carrying the weight of the world, the universe, on your shoulders anymore. And by the way, when you do that, just so you know, I do that, too. I do that right alongside with you. I mean, I am here for you forever, so please don't forget that. I'm sorry, is there something funny in that? Did I -- did I miss, like, the funny line there?",
        "Rafe: You are not a distraction. You're my life.",
        "Alison: Yeah. We, it probably would have been better if you would have just, like, said that off the top.",
        "Rafe: Well, maybe, but -- well, it seems like you had to blow off some steam, and so did I. And I had to definitely listen to what you had to say.",
        "Alison: Pretty much had no choice because I didn't really let you get a word in there, did I?",
        "Rafe: Could be true. But now that my butt has been sufficiently kicked --",
        "Alison: Back to work?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know, there's nothing I would love to do more than to stay here and argue with you and then make up with you and argue with you and then make love and argue with you and --",
        "Alison: But we need to find Livvie and Joshua.",
        "Rafe: What, \"we\"? You said \"we.\"",
        "Alison: Yeah. Please, don't forget about these shoulders also carrying --",
        "Rafe: Right, I know.",
        "Alison: The weight that you carry.",
        "Rafe: Right, you just said that. But here's the thing. That doesn't mean I want you in the line of fire. I mean, you also said that I am the -- well, the amazing vampire slayer? Greatest --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Greatest vampire slayer?",
        "Alison: Fine, fine, fine. But please tell me where you're going, at least.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, my first priority is Joshua. And I don't know where to begin looking. He's probably not at the rehearsal hall, and he's definitely not at Caleb's old digs.",
        "Alison: Do you really think that he would go after Livvie?",
        "Rafe: If he knows she's been turned, definitely. He'd probably try to take her away someplace.",
        "Alison: If only he was going to seduce her like he tried to seduce my mother.",
        "Rafe: Why is that? What do you mean?",
        "Alison: Well, she mentioned a place that he tried to drag her off to, some -- I don't know -- like, villa or dumpy bachelor pad or something. I don't know.",
        "Rafe: Did she say where it is?",
        "Alison: No, but she mentioned the name of it. It was -- um -- colum-- columbia manor -- no --",
        "Rafe: Columbia?",
        "Alison: Columbus manor.",
        "Rafe: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Thank you.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Rafe: I love you.",
        "Alison: Wait. Why? What -- what --",
        "Rafe: I might even love your mother. I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: I'm sorry, Livvie. Sooner or later, you're going to have to face the reality of our situation.",
        "Livvie: Not without Caleb.",
        "Joshua: Caleb is dead. They've cremated him. Now, eventually, you're going to have to open your eyes --",
        "Kevin: Would you back off?",
        "Joshua: I am trying to help your daughter.",
        "Kevin: Well, you're not. Honey, whatever's happened, you're not alone. We'll get through this together.",
        "Joshua: Excuse me for interrupting. But if you want to help her, you'll send her back into hiding with me.",
        "Kevin: I'm not letting you take my daughter away again.",
        "Joshua: You can't take care of her.",
        "Kevin: The hell I can't.",
        "Joshua: Dr. Collins, you know the powers of a vampire. I can defend her against the slayers better than you can.",
        "Kevin: Then you stay.",
        "Joshua: This is the first place they'll look for her.",
        "Kevin: Then why aren't they breaking down my door right now?",
        "Joshua: I don't know, but I'm sure sooner or later, they're going to show up.",
        "Kevin: No. They think I've gone off the deep end.",
        "Livvie: No, I don't -- I don't want to go back to that hiding place.",
        "Kevin: Then it's settled.",
        "Joshua: Did you paint this?",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Why?",
        "Joshua: It's highly unusual. It shows great depth, insight, passion. Maybe you are right. Maybe we should stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Stop it. I know what you're doing. You're just trying to pull me back in.",
        "Caleb: No. No, but I don't blame you for thinking that.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, so you don't want me?",
        "Caleb: I just know it's too late. That's why I didn't want to talk to you. I didn't want to be dragging you back into my problems.",
        "Elizabeth: There seem to be a lot of people out to get you.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. But somewhere, deep down inside, I -- I still have this hope that -- that we could --",
        "Elizabeth: Be together again?",
        "Caleb: I don't want you back like this. I want to deserve you.",
        "Elizabeth: I don't want to be hurt again.",
        "Caleb: I was a fool. I see now what I had when I was with you. You were good to me, Elizabeth. You were good for me.",
        "Elizabeth: I missed you.",
        "Caleb: I missed you. I need you.",
        "Elizabeth: You ?",
        "Caleb: You're the only one. You're the only one I can count on now, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. I missed you. And someday, you'll realize what you -- what you let go of, but, god, this is so much better. We can actually be together now as regular people.",
        "Caleb: I wish that were true.",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, wait. What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Rafe and the others -- they have trapped in this hospital. It'll only be a matter of time before they find me again.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, I'll help you get out.",
        "Caleb: Would you?",
        "Elizabeth: Absolutely. What do you want me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I -- I'll be right back. I'm going to get a tissue.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Joshua: You don't have to trust me, Dr. Collins. But Kivvie and I are safer together than apart. My self-preservation works in your favor.",
        "Kevin: You just stay focused on protecting my daughter and helping me do that until I can get her out of town.",
        "Joshua: What was your inspiration for this painting?",
        "Kevin: I paint from instinct.",
        "Joshua: Hmm. It has a certain depth. Not many people are capable of --",
        "Kevin: Look, just stay focused on my daughter, and we'll get along fine.",
        "Joshua: All right. But first, I have to go back to our hideout and get some supplies. Then we'll be set.",
        "Livvie: You're going back there?",
        "Joshua: Just to get a few things. Oh, I have something for you. Here. I have a feeling you might need this. I'm glad you're safe, Livvie. And I'm happy that we found a solution that works out for all of us. I'll be back.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry. Dad, I know how this must look to you.",
        "Kevin: You're my daughter. Nothing could ever diminish how much I love you.",
        "Livvie: I love you, too. I can't do this in front of you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, Joshua. It's time to see what you're next sick move is.",
        "Elizabeth: Here you go. Got you everything you asked for.",
        "Caleb: Dr. Carter -- that is perfect.",
        "Elizabeth: We are a good team, aren't we?",
        "Caleb: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: So, what do you say, Dr. Carter, where should we run off to? Paris? Tahiti?",
        "Caleb: Anywhere you want. Is the coast clear?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, I told the security guard that I saw you on the third floor, so they're all running there right now.",
        "Caleb: We don't have much time. I'm going to go ahead of you, ok?",
        "Elizabeth: Ok.",
        "Caleb: All right. Give me 30 seconds, then meet me in the parking lot.",
        "Elizabeth: All right.",
        "Caleb: All right.",
        "Elizabeth: See you soon.",
        "Nurse: Did you see that Dr. Carter?",
        "Deniece: No, but I know who he is.",
        "Nurse: He's so cute.",
        "Deniece: Cute? The man is 80 years old.",
        "Nurse: Then this must be a different Dr. Carter. I'd point him out to you, but he just went up to the roof to catch the Medevac.",
