        "Karen: Amazing. If it weren't for the different dress style and hairdo, this \r\nlooks just like me. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh! It's getting chilly out there. I can't believe it. Oh, my gosh! I \r\ndidn't know I had that picture in my things. ",
        "Karen: I -- I don't get it, Mom. All these years, you never showed me a \r\npicture of Aunt Carolyn, and now I find out that we look enough alike to be \r\ntwins? How come you never told me? ",
        "",
        "Frank: Talk about a small world. \"I live in Port Charles, too.\" ",
        "Cookie: \"Far out!\" ",
        "Frank: \"It's great we live in the same town. I can help you better.\" Kevin. \r\nKevin would be the perfect person for Cookie to talk to. \"I know a great doctor, \r\na friend who can help you. Let me give him your number so I can hook you up.\"\r\n",
        "Cookie: \"Nooooo! I don't want anyone to know about my problems or me. Only \r\nyou, Frank.\" ",
        "Frank: \"No. I don't want anyone to know about my problems or me. Only you, \r\nFrank!\" Ah! ",
        "",
        "Serena: I can hardly eat. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Sweet pea, you don't have to. Put -- put your fork down. You do not \r\nhave to eat. Remind me never go into that kitchen again. It's bad. It's \r\nbad, bad, bad. ",
        "Serena: Mom, the food's fine. It's just I'm excited about the school trip \r\ntomorrow. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, good! Really? I am so excited, too. Do you know this is going to be \r\nour first official mother and daughter trip to the Big Apple. ",
        "Serena: Kevin, I'm surprised you're not coming with us to New York. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I wish I could, honey, but I have got a lot of work to do. ",
        "Serena: There's something I got to do, too. May I be excused? ",
        "Lucy: Yes. I'll make you some toast or something later. You don't have to \r\npretend you like my food. All right, see you in a minute. ",
        "Kevin: I like it. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah, you've eaten none -- one bite. Listen, I know \r\nthere's a lot of stuff going on at the hospital -- I mean, between what happened \r\nwith Arianna and Ben's nosedive into eternity. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, death of a diplomat. It's bound to raise a lot of questions. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, so, Doc, I am serious. I can postpone this trip. I don't have to \r\ngo. I mean, I don't have to head out of here right now. ",
        "Kevin: No, no. I want you and Serena to go down to New York and have a \r\nwonderful time. I'll be fine. ",
        "",
        "Eve: What are you saying? You -- you can't honestly believe that for a \r\nmoment, this is over between us? ",
        "Ian: Arianna needs me. She -- she needs me, and I owe her that. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Ok, but when she gets better -- ",
        "Ian: She's lying in a hospital bed clinging to life because I wasn't there \r\nwhen she was attacked. I was with you. ",
        "Eve: Oh, stop it, Ian! I blame myself, too! But we cannot let this tear us \r\napart. ",
        "Ian: It already is. And this is not about blame. This is about \r\nresponsibility, my responsibility. We can't build a life with her blood on our \r\nhands. We can't. ",
        "",
        "Karen: Come on, Mom. How come you never mentioned how much I look like Aunt \r\nCarolyn? ",
        "Rhonda: Even after all these years, I find it difficult to talk about her.\r\n",
        "Karen: But this is more than a passing resemblance. It's -- it's almost like \r\nlooking in a mirror. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yes. And you are so much like her, too, and I just don't mean in \r\nlooks. I -- you know, I was always the big family screw-up, and she was \r\ndefinitely the special one. She had this -- oh -- jeez. ",
        "Karen: Well, tell me more about her. ",
        "Rhonda: Ok, well, she wanted to be a doctor just like you, and she had the \r\nbrains and ability to be a really incredible one. ",
        "Karen: I guess back in those days, it was harder for a woman to get into med \r\nschool. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, definitely. It was an uphill fight for Carolyn, I mean, \r\nespecially with all the stuff that was going on in her family. Neither of us had \r\na very easy time of it at home. ",
        "Karen: I can relate to that. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh. I am so sorry that I didn't make it easier for you. You know, you \r\ndeserved a mother who was sober enough to listen to your dreams. I mean, the \r\nhappiest day of my life was when you became a doctor, and Carolyn would've been \r\nso proud of you. ",
        "Karen: You know, it's funny, I guess. In a way, I'm living the life that \r\nCarolyn never had a chance to live. ",
        "Rhonda: I never told you this, but this belonged to Carolyn. ",
        "Karen: Really? ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: Well, it's nice having something of hers so close. ",
        "Rhonda: Somehow, I just wanted you to have the locket so somehow it might \r\nconnect you to the woman that you were named after. ",
        "Karen: Hmm. You know, you never told me how she died. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, I don't know. Even after all these years, it's so hard to talk \r\nabout. It was this really terrible accident and she was just too young. ",
        "Karen: What happened? ",
        "Rhonda: You know what? I -- I think I'm all talked out. Maybe we could just \r\nfinish the packing later. I -- ",
        "Karen: Yeah. ",
        "Rhonda: Think I'm going to go home. ",
        "Karen: Ok. Um -- can I keep the picture? ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure Carolyn would've loved that. Um, I'll -- \r\nI'll talk to you later, all right, honey? ",
        "Karen: Who are you? What were you like? There are so many questions. ",
        "",
        "[Monitor beeps] ",
        "Deneice: Hey, do you know anything about this business with her brother's \r\ndeath? The whole hospital's buzzing about it. ",
        "Chris: Well, all I heard was that Kevin Collins put Arianna's brother -- Ben?\r\n",
        "Deneice: Yeah. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, in a much-deserved 72-hour psychiatric hold. Then the guy broke \r\nout of the ward and took a swan dive off the roof. ",
        "Deneice: God, that's terrible. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, it's a lot swifter death than I would've chosen for the idiot.\r\n",
        "Arianna: Ben's dead? ",
        "Chris: Arianna. You're awake. How are you feeling? ",
        "Arianna: Ben? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. I'm -- I'm sorry you overheard us talking. We thought you were \r\nsleeping. Yeah, your brother -- your brother died. ",
        "Arianna: Soon I'll join him. ",
        "",
        "Eve: This is not the right time for us to make any decisions about our \r\nfuture, Ian. ",
        "Ian: You know this is not what I want. ",
        "Eve: Oh, I know that. But I feel just as responsible for Arianna's attack.\r\n",
        "Ian: Ok, well, then you understand. ",
        "Eve: What I understand is this is not the time for us to be figuring out what \r\nwe're going to do for the rest of our lives. We should be concentrating on \r\ngetting Arianna well. ",
        "Ian: What if she doesn't get well? You saw how badly she was hurt. ",
        "Eve: Then all the more reason for us to act like the doctors we are and try \r\nand save her life. ",
        "Ian: I -- ",
        "Eve: No, if you think I'm going to let you walk away from me, you're wrong! I \r\ndid not come this far and fight this hard for you to end it like this \r\nbetween us. ",
        "Ian: First, it was my sister, then Arianna. Everything I touch, everyone I \r\ntouch, I -- we can't go on like this. ",
        "Eve: No. We are in this relationship together. Together. I -- I won't let you \r\ndo this to us. I won't let you do this to us. ",

        "Cookie: \"I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone what I've told you.\" ",
        "Frank: \"But you need help, Cookie. You can't solve your problems alone.\" ",
        "Cookie: \"I have you, Frank.\" ",
        "Frank: \"We have to stop contacting each other this way.\" ",
        "Cookie: \"Is your girlfriend jealous?\" ",
        "Frank: Let's see -- how do I explain that Karen isn't jealous, she just \r\nthinks I'm totally nuts? \"It's okay, Frank. I can help myself. I know \r\nsomething that will make me feel lots better.\" \"What are you going to do?\" ",
        "Cookie: \"Have a few drinks. It's no big deal. Cheers.\" ",
        "Frank: \"Drinking's no answer.\" ",
        "Cookie: \"I've done it before. It really helps mellow me out.\" ",
        "Frank: \"Don't drink, Cookie. Bad move.\" ",
        "Karen: What's with you, Frank? You just can't stop, can you? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Ok, here is our plan. First, don't you think the Natural History Museum \r\n-- and you have to see that great, big, huge whale hanging from the ceiling -- \r\nand then the new planetarium, although, I'm going to have to bribe somebody to \r\nget us through all those lines and -- ",
        "Serena: Cool. ",
        "Lucy: Fifth Avenue. We'll stroll up Fifth Avenue with our charge cards out -- \r\nready, ready, ready, ready, ready. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, cha-ching, cha-ching. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'll get it. ",

        "Lucy: You're kidding. ",
        "Serena: We have to talk over our CD list for the trip. I'll talk upstairs.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, good idea. ",
        "Kevin: That's the third call from Mandy, isn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I think so. I think the debate was N Sync and Backstreet Boys -- \r\nwho's the cutest? Now it's Dixie Chicks, Shedaisy -- who really rocks the \r\ncountry world? ",
        "Kevin: Dixie Chicks. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ",
        "Kevin: She's had her eyes on that phone all night long. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but she's not the only one. Doc, do you realize every time the \r\nphone rings, you seem to jump into some sort of crisis mode. ",
        "Kevin: Occupational hazard. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'm just kind of worried about you, though, you know? I mean, you \r\ndid mention that you're having sort of doubts about being able to do this new \r\njob so well, you know. ",
        "Kevin: You mean, can I handle all the sick and twisted things that I'll be \r\ndealing with? Like a brother trying to kill his own sister? Yes, I can, thanks \r\nto you. ",
        "Lucy: To me? ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. You said something earlier that really got to me. ",
        "Lucy: What gem of wisdom could I possibly have imparted? ",
        "Kevin: That whenever things get to be too overwhelming, I should just come \r\nhome and spend time with the people I love, like you and Serena. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. You know, I really do believe that love is the greatest healer \r\nof all. ",
        "Kevin: I think you might be right. And somehow, when I'm with you, the bad \r\nthings just don't seem so bad. So how did I get so lucky anyway? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute. I am the lucky one. Very lucky. ",

        "Eve: What happened to Arianna is terrible. But don't make this a worse \r\ntragedy by destroying us, too. ",
        "Ian: I'm trying to make this right. ",
        "Eve: How? By ruining three lives? Think about what you would be doing to \r\nall of us. ",
        "Ian: You're right. You're right. Let's not worry about the past, let's not \r\nworry about the future. Just worry about the present. We have a patient to save.\r\n",

        "Ian: Don't you think she has enough to deal with without that? ",
        "Eve: Hey, what Chris did could happen to anyone. It was a mistake. ",
        "Ian: Now you're defending him! ",
        "Eve: That's not fair! ",
        "Chris: Hey, I just spent the night saving your wife's life. ",
        "Ian: You're a doctor! You're supposed to take care of people that need you! \r\nThat's your job. That's your job! ",

        "Karen: Not another word. I need to talk to you. I have to show you something.\r\n",
        "Frank: I've never seen this picture of you before. When did you have your \r\nhair like this? ",
        "Karen: This isn't me. It's a picture of my Aunt Carolyn. She died before I \r\nwas born. I mean, couldn't I pass for her double? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, totally. ",
        "Karen: That's what I thought. And then I started asking my mom all these \r\nquestions, and she shut down, like totally freaked out. I mean, don't you think \r\nit's weird that we look so much alike and I haven't found out about it before \r\ntoday? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, it's weird. ",
        "Karen: So all my questions got my mom so upset, I told her to go to the bar, \r\norder herself a nice, tall drink, and then I'd meet her there, you know, to meet \r\nsome sailors for the weekend? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, that's nice. ",

        "Frank: I know! I know, but it's like this computer has a mind of its own and \r\nit seems it wants me in contact with Cookie. ",
        "Karen: Do you hear yourself? I'm sorry, but this is getting enough for me. \r\nThis is my computer, right? ",

        "Frank: I was this close to getting Cookie some help. Then she said she was \r\ngoing to do something drastic. ",
        "Karen: Don't you get it? We don't even know who is writing to us or how. I \r\njust know I had to put a stop to it somehow. ",
