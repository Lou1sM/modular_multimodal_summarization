        "After finding the disturbing photos in Joshua's hideout, Ian and Rafe arrange for a very frightened Alison to stay with Lucy. Alison shows Rafe the black rose, which was pink until she touched it, and Rafe assumes that it's a warning from Joshua. Lucy suspects that there's more to her weakened condition than merely stress. Livvie feels that something is happening, but she doesn't suspect that Joshua has trapped her lover at the villa. Joshua taunts Caleb with ideas of getting close to Olivia, but Caleb knows it's all talk. After trying several passwords, Ian finally breaks into Joshua's computer with the word \"ring.\" Joshua moves Caleb to a cell, where he continues his tall tales of getting close to Olivia. He admits that she would look for him if she hadn't been assured of his death. Caleb expresses the opinion that if the slayers don't kill Joshua, Olivia will. After knocking out her father with a bookend, Livvie waits outside Rafe's apartment, where she presents the slayer with a hand-carved stake and asks him to kill her."

        "Ian: Yeah, I'm still here.",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm worried enough. I need you to come home. When are you coming home?",
        "Ian: I don't know, but there's something else we need to worry about.",
        "Lucy: What does that mean? What do we need to worry about?",
        "Ian: It looks Joshua's after Alison.",
        "Lucy: What? Why?",
        "Ian: I don't know. I don't have all the answers I need you to do something.",
        "Lucy: Sure, of course. You know anything.",
        "Ian: Get a room ready. Alison's moving in with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison? What -- what happened?",
        "Alison: I don't know, Rafe. Why don't you tell me. What's wrong now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Something's happening. I can feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Caleb grunts]",
        "Joshua: I'm not quite who you were expecting, am I?",
        "Caleb: Cut me loose!",
        "Joshua: Oh, my. You are behind the times. See, things have changed. I don't take orders from you anymore, master Caleb. I give them.",
        "Caleb: Well, enjoy it while you can!",
        "Joshua: You know, from where I stand, you're in no position to threaten me, especially given our new dynamic -- me, vampire, you, not.",
        "Caleb: Ugh! Where is Olivia?",
        "Joshua: A word of advice -- don't struggle so much. The silks will tighten and eventually they'll strangle you.",
        "Caleb: I said, where is she?",
        "Joshua: Olivia? Your lovely young bride? She's fine. But she'll be better because I intend to make her very happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I don't understand. You found snapshots of Port Charles hidden in Joshua's office?",
        "Ian: And the painting with all the same buildings in it.",
        "Lucy: What painting?",
        "Ian: \"What painting?\" It's sitting right here. It's got the Recovery Room, the police station, the hospital --",
        "Lucy: All right, that's weird, that doesn't mean Alison is in any kind of danger, really, does it?",
        "Ian: I think he's stalking her.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Ian: We -- we found these surveillance-type photos. You know, it's just Livvie and Alison all over town.",
        "Lucy: Whoa, are you telling me that Livvie's involved in this, too?",
        "Ian: Yeah, I think he's following both of them.",
        "Lucy: Ok, this guy is really weird. I want you to get out of there.",
        "Ian: I can't, not yet.",
        "Lucy: Yes, you can. Yes, you can yet. Get home, please.",
        "Ian: No, I'm trying to stay one step ahead of him so there won't be any surprises.",
        "Lucy: Ok, fine. Be careful.",
        "Ian: Always.",
        "Lucy: Ian?",
        "Ian: I said always! I said I'd be careful.",
        "Lucy: I love you.",
        "Ian: I love you more.",
        "Lucy: I love you more.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Whoa. Oh, whoa. What in the world is that about? Oh, that's not just my head. What is this about? I don't feel so good. It can't just be stress. Oh, the room is spinning. Ok, deep breath. You're fine. Yikes. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: After everything that you and I have been through, I really feel like this is just the last straw, you know?",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, where'd you get this?",
        "Alison: It just sort of appeared on the bed when -- a perfect pink rose.",
        "Rafe: Pink rose?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. Naturally, I thought that it was from you.",
        "Rafe: This isn't pink.",
        "Alison: I know. It's not anymore.",
        "Rafe: So what are you saying? It just turned?",
        "Alison: It turned black the second I touched it.",
        "Rafe: Damn him.",
        "Alison: Hey, do you know who sent this?",
        "Rafe: Joshua.",
        "Alison: Joshua? Why would Joshua send this? Please tell me, honestly.",
        "Rafe: I have reason to believe that you could be in danger from him. This is obviously a warning.",
        "Alison: Why? Why would I be in danger?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why this psycho does anything.",
        "Alison: Rafe, I don't want to do this --",
        "Rafe: Listen to me. We're going to show him that it's not so easy, all right? Now, first thing, I'm going to get you to Lucy's.",
        "Alison: Rafe --",
        "Rafe: You're going to stay with her.",
        "Alison: Lucy's? Why?",
        "Rafe: Yes, because she's a slayer and she can watch after you while I'm out doing whatever it is I have to do.",
        "Alison: No --",
        "Rafe: Do you understand?",
        "Alison: No, I don't want to do this. I don't want to be separated from you again!",
        "Rafe: Look -- listen to me. Listen to me -- listen, listen. I don't like this any more than you do, but we're talking about a temporary separation here. Otherwise, Joshua gets what he wants, and he's going to make it a more permanent one. All right? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You really are proud of yourself, aren't you?",
        "Joshua: It never crossed my mind, but now that you mention it --",
        "Caleb: This the best you could do? Huh? Tie me up in some cloth? That's your idea of a victory?",
        "Joshua: Well, the irony has obviously escaped you.",
        "Caleb: The irony?",
        "Joshua: Yes. Watching you debase yourself? I tried to warn you ahead of another fall, but, no, you wouldn't listen to me. Then I had no choice. Then I had to relieve you of your command. And what fitting poetic justice this is, here, this place, scene of your many humiliations. It should be the scene of your last.",
        "Caleb: You know, you think you know about my life. You don't know anything.",
        "Joshua: I'll tell you what I do know. I know how sad it is. You were once powerful, leader of a vampire kingdom. And now you have nothing and because of what? Because of love. You don't even have love. It's gone. And now you've lost the girl. Oh, my. It's like a very pathetic B movie, isn't it?",
        "Caleb: The movie isn't over yet.",
        "Joshua: Keep telling yourself that.",
        "Caleb: You think she'll ever have something to do with you, you're delusional.",
        "Joshua: Am I? Well, she already has.",
        "Caleb: I don't believe it.",
        "Joshua: I don't care. I know the truth.",
        "Caleb: Yeah -- a cheap vampire trick.",
        "Joshua: Which is?",
        "Caleb: Lying to distract your enemies. The least you could have done is made it a believable lie. Olivia with you? Oh, you might have fooled her for a moment, but sooner or later, she'll figure you out. And when she does, she's going to kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: All right. I know what I have to do. I have to end this, once and for all.",
        "Kevin: Livvie? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Come on, Thornhart. They say a password's always the most obvious thing. So, I'll try to get into Joshua's head -- God forbid. Let's see. \"666,\" all right? Why not?",
        "[Computer beeps]",
        "Ian: \"666temple.\"",
        "[Beep]",
        "Ian: \"Temple666.\"",
        "[Beep]",
        "Ian: Nothing. \"King of the bloodsuckers.\"",
        "[Beep]",
        "Ian: Hmm. Ok. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think. Even if I could get in his head, the possibilities are endless. Come on. Well, isn't that funny? It almost looks like the camera is focused on the ring more than the face. Worth a shot, right? Let's see. \"Jewelry.\"",
        "[Beep]",
        "Ian: Nope. \"Crown,\" maybe?",
        "[Beep]",
        "Ian: \"Bracelet.\"",
        "[Beep]",
        "Ian: \"Ring.\"",
        "[Computer fanfare]",
        "Ian: \"Ring.\" That did it. That's it -- \"ring.\" I'm in. So \"ring,\" what is that all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to startle you. Actually, I want to apologize.",
        "Livvie: Apologize?",
        "Kevin: I came down on you pretty hard about Caleb.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you did.",
        "Kevin: I know what he meant to you -- still means to you. And it doesn't matter how much I like it or not. I shouldn\"t tell you how to feel.",
        "Livvie: Thank you.",
        "Kevin: It tears me up to see you this way, honey.",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry, dad.",
        "Kevin: What do you have to be sorry for?",
        "Livvie: Because I realize you were just trying to be a dad and look out for me.",
        "Kevin: No argument there.",
        "Livvie: But the same way you told me to trust you that things would get easier, I need you to do the same thing for me, too.",
        "Kevin: I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "Livvie: What I'm going through right now, what I'm feeling, I'm feeling for a reason. Even though it may put you in some kind of pain to see me in pain, I need you to believe that I know what's best for me. And I will let go of Caleb when I'm ready, not before.",
        "Kevin: Ok. I'll back off. But I won't let you out of my sight until I know you're safe.",
        "Livvie: Dad thing again.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, you're stuck with it.",
        "Livvie: I love you, daddy.",
        "Kevin: I love you, too.",
        "Livvie: You know, that tea sounds really good right now",
        "kevin: Yeah?",
        "Livvie: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: I'll get it for you. You know, this might be a little cold. Maybe I'll just go make you another one. Yeah. Oh --",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll make things better, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: So why'd you cut me down?",
        "Joshua: You looked so uncomfortable.",
        "Caleb: I would have tightened those ropes till your eyes popped out.",
        "Joshua: Believe me, I was tempted by that alternative, but, well, this is better.",
        "Caleb: So you keep me prisoner. What's the point?",
        "Joshua: The point? The point is to watch you suffer. Killing you would be a temporary pleasure, but this way watching you live like this -- for me, it's a daily delight.",
        "Caleb: Yeah? What do you have in mind?",
        "Joshua: Well, I'm not going to give away all my surprises. But it's going to go something like this -- I'm going to turn your life into a living hell, much the way you did with mine, only you're not going to do my bidding. This is the way it's going to work -- I'm going to give you a daily report on my relationship with your beloved, our ever-increasing bond, kind of like a show- and-tell of my love life. And we will get closer. We're the only two vampires left. But of course, eventually, she'll want to start a family.",
        "Caleb: You think you got it all figured out, don't you?",
        "Joshua: Oh, yes, I have, and do you know why? Because I've carefully planned it. Unlike you, I leave no room for mistakes.",
        "Caleb: She despises you. She'll always wonder where I am. Olivia won't stop until she finds me.",
        "Joshua: Well, that would be true, except right now she believes you're dead.",
        "Caleb: Dead.",
        "Joshua: Murdered by the slayers. Of course, after a period of mourning -- I'd say one or two weeks -- she'll be only too happy to allow me to pick up the pieces.",
        "Caleb: I wouldn't count on it.",
        "Joshua: Really? Well, Livvie's the only person that cares that you're gone. So this is the way it's going to play out. You're going to live the rest of your sad, pathetic life under my tyranny, under my whims, under my demands, my temperament, and only for as long as it amuses me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey! Come on in, you two.",
        "Rafe: I guess Ian brought you up to speed?",
        "Lucy: Yes, he did. Don't you think it's kind of ironic we'd get rid of one nut and we got an even bigger nut -- or what's that saying about \"it's better the devil you know than the devil you don't know\"?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Oh, Lucy, I'm hoping that's not the case.",
        "Lucy: Uh-oh. You're -- you're right. So am I. Sorry.",
        "Rafe: Anyway, thanks for helping out, you know, letting Alison stay here.",
        "Lucy: Well, of course. You know I'd do anything for you guys, and besides, it's not like you haven't stayed here before. This was your home. This can be your home again. Anything that's mine is yours.",
        "Alison: Thanks very much.",
        "Lucy: Hey. Are you ok?",
        "Alison: No, not really.",
        "Rafe: Joshua basically, well, kind of freaked her out. He sent us a warning.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God.",
        "Alison: No, I know that this is sort of silly after everything that we've been through, but --",
        "Lucy: No, I don't think it's silly at all. Something is a little bit different. I can feel it, too. Rafe, I don't want to hold this.",
        "Alison: Can't you, though? It's like a different kind of a fear. It's more raw. Even after all the times that we've ever fought Caleb, you know, I -- I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Rafe: Hey, hey.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: Hey. Come here.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: Come here.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: Look at me.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Rafe: I'm going to take care of this. All right? I promise. I'm going to get rid of Joshua and you're never going to have to be afraid again, not ever.",
        "Lucy: Hey, you know something? Rafe's right. You know, I am making such a big deal out of this when Joshua's probably just small potatoes, you know, and we'll get through this. We'll get through this like we always do, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Right.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know.",
        "Rafe: All right, Lucy, just keep an eye on her, all right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: I got to go.",
        "Alison: Rafe?",
        "Rafe: I will be careful. You, too, all right? Just stay with Lucy.",
        "Alison: Ok, I will.",
        "Rafe: Try not to worry.",
        "Alison: Easier said than done.",
        "Rafe: I love you.",
        "Alison: I love you, too.",
        "Rafe: It won't be long. Ok?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: It won't be long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: All right, Joshua. Let's have a look at this, huh? Ok, expense report for your horrible band. No need to look at that. Tour dates, is it? Yeah. Ok. What's this? A list -- in code. What are you up to, Joshua?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb's voice: I knew I would never love again until I saw you, Olivia, and then my heart started beating again. Olivia -- my present and my future. You're the magic, Olivia.",
        "Joshua: Well, it's been a very long day for both of us, so I will wish you good night. Oh, I -- I would offer you a blanket or something from room service, but now since you're a mortal, I'm sure you'll want to get in touch with all those human things, you know, being cold and uncomfortable, hungry, miserable, things that I will never have to experience again.",
        "Caleb: You're not fooling anyone.",
        "Joshua: Excuse me?",
        "Caleb: God, it must be frustrating for you.",
        "Joshua: Why is that?",
        "Caleb: Wanting so desperately to have it all and knowing you never will.",
        "Joshua: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Caleb: Well, let's start with who you really are, Joshua. And no matter how much you posture and all the threats, you're still just a lackey at heart. And if the slayers don't kill you, I'm betting Olivia does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Livvie. What are you doing here? We've been looking all over for you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know you have, Rafe. That's why I'm here. I want you to kill me.",
        "Livvie: You won, Rafe. You got what you wanted. Caleb's dead. Now, do us all a favor and end it for me now."
