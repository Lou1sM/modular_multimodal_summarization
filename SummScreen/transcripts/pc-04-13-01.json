        "Alison: God, I feel like I'm in \"Alice in Wonderland\" or something. ",
        "Jack: Who? ",
        "Alison: You know, when she got the mysterious note and key. ",
        "Jack: I wasn't much of a reader. ",
        "Alison: \"This is just for you. Don't tell Jamal.\" What do you think that this \r\nmeans? ",
        "Jack: Aha. Well, I can solve one part of the mystery. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jack: Look, it's a number, see? It's engraved, just like a -- ",
        "Alison: Just like a post office box. ",
        "Jack: That would be my bet. ",
        "Alison: Well, what do you think's in the box, and why can't I tell Jamal? ",
        "Jack: Well, the better question is, who sent it to you? ",
        "",
        "Karen: No, I am not going to Kelly's with you and make this some kind of cozy \r\nthreesome with your cyber-phantom pal Cookie. ",
        "Frank: Well, will you at least listen to my reason for going? ",
        "Karen: You want to talk logic? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: Ok, then explain this to me. I killed that computer. I yanked out all \r\nits wiring. It was done, dead, kaput. So how can you still possibly be getting \r\nmessages from Cookie? ",
        "Frank: Ok. So I don't have a really good answer to that question, but there \r\nare a lot of unanswered questions where Cookie's concerned. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, I'll say. ",
        "Frank: All the more reason for you to come with me. Meet Cookie in person. \r\nThen maybe things will finally start to make sense. ",

        "Radio Announcer: And now get rocking with one of the biggest hits of 1973.\r\n",
        "Cookie: I miss you so much. You were my best friend. But tonight I'm meeting \r\nmy new friend -- Frank. He's real nice. He's someone I can talk to. Almost the \r\nway I used to talk to you.",
        "",
        "Eve: Colleen, what are you doing? ",
        "Colleen: Ian signed his wife's release papers. He's transferring her out. ",
        "Eve: Well, she's not gone yet. Take that. Not if I can help it. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I know we haven't talked for a while. And I'm not real good at asking \r\nfor things, but I'm at a crossroads and I'm running out of steam. So I need to \r\nask you -- I need to ask your opinion on something. Am I doing the right thing?\r\n",
        "",
        "Alison: What if this is, like, a secret plan of Jamal's, right? He wants me \r\nto, like, go to the box and open it and a thousand rose petals fall out with a \r\nbig fat diamond ring. ",
        "Jack: A diamond? On what Jamal makes here at the bike shop? Not likely. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why would Jamal send you something and put \"don't tell Jamal\" on \r\nthe note? ",
        "Alison: To throw me off his track. ",
        "Jack: Now you're reaching for it. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, big time. ",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: Fine, then. I'm back to square one, totally clueless. ",
        "Jack: Well, you know what I would do? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jack: Close the shop down for 20 minutes and go check out the post office \r\nbox. ",
        "Alison: Yes! ",
        "Jack: Mystery solved. ",
        "Alison: Yes, yes! Totally! No, no, because then I would be lying to Jamal, \r\nand I refuse to do that under pain of death. No. ",
        "Jack: Suit yourself. ",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal's just out making a house call on a very sick bike. He'll \r\nbe home soon. ",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: Well, I bet you a slice of pizza you can't wait that long. ",
        "Alison: You're on, sucker. ",
        "Jack: Ok. ",
        "Alison: I can wait. ",

        "Frank: Hey, look, I've got to get to Kelly's. ",
        "Karen: Why? ",
        "Frank: Humor me, Karen. Come with me and then I'll go shoe shopping with you \r\nor to a really long foreign film. Name your price. ",
        "Karen: Look, I'm not going to stand here and argue with you, Frank. If you \r\nwant to get in even deeper with this kid, fine, but don't drag me into it. ",
        "Frank: Hey, you're the one freaked out about me communicating with a \r\nnameless, faceless person. Well, let's go put a face to the name. ",
        "Karen: You're going alone. ",
        "Frank: Karen, come on. This is a kid in need, like we once were. ",
        "Karen: Don't try to play on my sympathy, Frank, because there's not much of \r\nit left. ",
        "Frank: Look, I know this -- this whole thing kind of bugs you. ",
        "Karen:  Kind of? ",
        "Frank: But once we talk to Cookie face to face, point her in the right \r\ndirection, we will both feel better about ourselves because we helped someone in \r\nneed, someone who sounds like she could do something drastic. ",
        "Karen: You really think this Cookie -- or whoever it is -- might try and kill \r\nherself? ",
        "Frank: If Cookie really is who she says she is, she is a kid on the verge of \r\ndoing some real harm to herself. Now, you're a doctor. You might really be able \r\nto help this girl. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, but chances are this lonely teen act is just a routine to get \r\nyou to meet her. ",
        "Frank: If that's the case, I will buy us all dinner and we'll call it a \r\nnight. But if it's not a scam, I could never forgive myself for turning my back \r\non a kid in need. How about you? ",
        "Karen: All right, I'll go. But on one condition -- that this is all over \r\ntonight. ",
        "Frank: Trust me, Karen, I want that, too. ",
        "Karen: Ok, you have a date. ",
        "Frank: All right. ",
        "",
        "Alan: May I sit? ",
        "Ian: If you're here to talk me out of taking Arianna, you're wasting your \r\ntime. ",
        "Alan: I know it's a done deal already. ",
        "Ian: I signed the papers. The last thing I need right now is a lecture from \r\nyou. ",
        "Alan: You have every right to do what you think is best. I support you. ",
        "Ian: You're not here to change my mind? ",
        "Alan: I'm here just to make sure that you've thought this through. And if \r\nthis is what you want, I offer you my full assistance. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. ",
        "Alan: Just because I'm the chief of staff doesn't mean that I can't relate to \r\na husband who wants to do everything to protect his wife. ",
        "Ian: I know. You know more about that than anyone. ",
        "Alan: Yeah. I definitely know what it's like to watch someone you care about \r\nget weaker and weaker every day, and you can't do a damn thing about it except \r\noffer your comfort and support. And you also know that everything that you're \r\ndoing may not be enough. ",
        "Ian: So helpless. I look at Arianna and I -- ",
        "Alan: You want to trade places with her. You're so used to saving lives, and \r\nhere you are caring about someone so deeply and you're -- you're totally \r\nhelpless, you're powerless. I've been there, Ian. ",
        "Ian: I know you have. I know. But the difference is that you couldn't prevent \r\nthe cancer from attacking Monica. I could've stopped Ben. ",
        "Alan: You don't know that. ",
        "Ian: No, I do know that. I wasn't there. If Arianna dies -- ",
        "Alan: Arianna -- ",
        "Ian: I'll have no one to blame but myself. ",
        "Alan: Arianna does not have to die. Eve has offered you a solution. There's a \r\ndrug treatment. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, it's a risky one. ",
        "Alan: Everything in life is a risk. If you're worried about Arianna dying \r\nhere because of the drug treatment, I guarantee you she will die if you take her \r\nout of this hospital. ",
        "Ian: I don't know that and you don't know that. There's no guarantee with \r\nthat drug. It's too new. ",
        "Alan: You are a doctor who has looked for new treatments and new drugs for \r\neverything for your patients. You're a guy who has always pushed the envelope. \r\nWhy not now -- particularly now? ",
        "Ian: She has put her trust in me, Alan. I can't make another mistake with her \r\nlife. ",
        "Alan: Then you'd better think very carefully about the lesser of the two \r\nevils. And you'd better be able to say somewhere down the line with conviction \r\nthat you did everything you could to save her life. Will you be able to say \r\nthat, Ian? ",
        "Ian: Can I ask you a question? What would you do? What would you do if it was \r\nMonica lying in that hospital bed? ",
        "Alan: I'd give her the drug. I would grab onto whatever I could. You need to \r\nthink about it, Ian. ",

        "Alison: I don't think my watch is working right. ",
        "Jack: Wait a second, do you smell that? I -- I smell pepperoni pizza. Yeah.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, dream on. Please. Let's talk about something else to get our mind \r\noff this key that is driving me crazy. Why don't you give me the dirt on what \r\nhappened with you and Livvie?",
        "Jack: Uh, some things are private, Alison, even from you. ",
        "Alison: Fine, don't tell me. ",
        "Jack: Ok, I won't. ",
        "Alison: She's just going to tell me all the details tomorrow. No, but, \r\nactually, I am really happy that we all get to hang out again -- you know, the \r\nfour of us. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, I kind of missed it, too. ",
        "Alison: I'm actually even thinking about asking Livvie to help me raise some \r\nmoney to turn this place into a hangout. You know, so we could have, like, all \r\nthose big, giant cups of coffee, you know, that are really expensive and all \r\nthe, like, latest and greatest magazines and food. I am a very good cook, did \r\nyou know?",
        "Jack: Well, didn't Jamal veto that? ",
        "Alison: Well, yeah, but he just said that just because he's being cautious. \r\nHe doesn't want us getting in over our heads. ",
        "Jack: Well, hey, it could be cool if you could figure it out. ",
        "Alison: I know. That's what my nana said, too -- which totally blew me away. \r\nYeah. Ok. Ahem. ",
        "[Jack whistles] ",
        "Alison: Where the hell is Jamal? This key is burning a hole in my pocket. ",
        "Jack: Hey, where you going? I thought we were supposed to be holding down the \r\nshop. ",
        "Alison: Come on, pizza boy. I can't stand it anymore. Let's go find out what \r\nthis mystery is all about. ",

        "Arianna: Hey. ",
        "Eve: How's that pain medication? You feeling better? Is it helping? ",
        "Arianna: A little. ",
        "Eve: Arianna -- ahem -- there's something important I would like to discuss \r\nwith you. It's about your treatment. ",
        "Arianna: I'm dying, aren't I? ",
        "Eve: Not if I can help it. Look, we don't like to lose patients around here. \r\nIt's really bad for our reputation. ",
        "Arianna: I'll remember. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Arianna, you're very weak and we'd like to treat you with a drug to \r\nmake you stronger to prepare you for a liver transplant. ",
        "Arianna: Ok. ",
        "Eve: There is some risk involved. I'm not going to sugarcoat this. The risk \r\nis that the drug could fail and make things worse. But you've taken a big risk \r\nin leaving your country and escaping your family to save your life. This could \r\nbe one more risk. ",
        "Arianna: You think I should? ",
        "Eve: In my heart, I believe there's more danger to you if we don't do this. I \r\njust want you to know all the options, ok? ",
        "Arianna: What does Ian say? ",
        "Ian: I agree with Eve. I think we should do anything necessary to get you \r\nwell. ",
        "Eve: Ian, I didn't know you were standing there. I was just -- ",
        "Ian: You were telling her what I was going to tell her. Thanks. ",

        "Ian: I know you're scared. ",
        "Arianna: Yeah. ",

        "Frank: Well, we're about to meet Cookie in the flesh. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, well, this is crazy, but I have to actually admit I'm a little \r\nnervous. I just have this feeling that -- ",
        "Frank: What? ",
        "Karen: Never mind. It's just this whole thing -- it's a little too mysterious and \r\nspooky for me. ",
        "Frank: But you're here. ",
        "Karen: I'm here. ",
        "Frank: And all it has to be is a quick meeting. \"Hi. How are you? Here's \r\nKevin's number,\" so she can get the help she needs. Don't worry. Think she's \r\nhere? ",
        "Karen: I don't know. You guys have the strange connection. ",
        "Frank: You know, that looks like it could be her. ",

        "Woman: No, thanks. I just ate. ",
        "Frank: Look, I wasn't offering you dessert. I was looking for a girl.",
        "Woman: Sure you were. Nice try though",
        "Frank: Thanks. Ahem. Not her. ",
        "Karen: Hmm. Maybe instead of hitting on all the lonely girls in the place, we \r\nshould just have a seat, wait for Cookie to find us. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sounds like a plan. Wonder where she is. ",

        "Jack: Mmm. All right, sorry. ",

        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jack: 398. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Oh, my God, it fits. Wait, I'm not -- I'm not, like, technically \r\nkeeping something from Jamal or telling him a lie keeping a secret, am I, if I \r\ntell him later? ",
        "Jack: No, no, technically, it's not a secret. ",
        "Alison: Good, because, you know, secrets in a relationship are really, like, \r\ntoxic poison. They are intimacy busters. Talk show hosts say that all the time.",
        "Jack: Open the door! ",
        "Alison: All right! ",
        "Jack: Ok. Open it. ",
        "Alison: I just -- I don't really -- ",

        "Frank: Well, maybe Cookie got cold feet or her dad wouldn't let her out of \r\nthe house. ",
        "Karen: Or maybe Cookie is a 50-year-old truck driver with a beer gut. ",
        "Frank: She said  she will be here, and she will. ",
        "Karen: Ok, we'll give her a few more minutes. And then I'm finding an \r\nall-night mall and you're going to be taking me on a long, excruciating shopping \r\ntrip. ",

        "Ian: Just be strong, all right? ",
        "Eve: Just close your eyes. You don't need to worry about a thing. We have to \r\ntry this. ",
        "Eve: All right. The drug should be taking effect soon. ",
        "Ian: Now all we have to do is wait. All right, don't be afraid. ",
