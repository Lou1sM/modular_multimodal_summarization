        "Karen: Face it, Frank. I think you've been stood up by a 16-year-old. ",
        "Frank: Cookie said she will be here, and she will. Just give her a few more \r\nminutes. Hello. Hello, there. ",
        "Rhonda: Well -- hi. Hi. I didn't expect to -- ahem -- see anyone I knew here.\r\n",

        "Jack: Alison, we've already counted it a dozen times. There's 25 Gs in the \r\nbag. ",
        "Alison: I know. I want to see it again. I want to smell it. ",
        "Jack: You going to call Jamal, tell him some stranger sent you a fortune in a \r\npost office box? ",
        "Alison: A stranger? Oh, no way, Jos\u00e9. This is the handiwork of Nana. This is, \r\nlike, tip money to her. ",
        "Jack: So, what, are you going to call and thank her? ",
        "Alison: No. I'm going to tell her that I can't take it. ",

        "Ian: Wait a minute. ",
        "Chris: What the hell's going on? I thought she was stable. ",
        "Ian: She was stable. We gave her the hepatin and she crashed. ",
        "Eve: I gave it to her. If anything happens to Arianna, I'm to blame. Here we \r\ngo. Charging, 200. ",
        "Gabriela: Charged. ",
        "Eve: Clear! Come on. Don't you die. I'm not going to let you die. She's still \r\nin v-fib. Hyperventilate her. Charging, 300. ",

        "Jack: Hey, hey. Would you just cool it a minute and think about what you're \r\ndoing? ",
        "Alison: All I'm saying is that I'm not going to take her bribe money. What do \r\nyou think that you're doing? ",
        "Jack: Hey, no. I'm keeping you from making a big mistake. ",
        "Alison: Jack, this money is from Nana. ",
        "Jack: Who obviously went to a lot of trouble to make sure you'd keep it no \r\nstrings attached. ",
        "Alison: There are always strings with Nana. ",
        "Jack: Alison, your grandmother just had a heart attack. ",
        "Alison: I know, and I'm so grateful that she is ok. ",
        "Jack: And she almost bit the big one, all right? That really can shake a \r\nperson up. Maybe your nana has changed. ",
        "Alison: What, you think this is, like, the start of a kinder, gentler Nana?\r\n",
        "Jack: It's possible. ",
        "Alison: It's not like this money wouldn't come in handy. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, it might. ",
        "Alison: Well, we did sort of make up. ",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: So do you think I should keep it? ",
        "Jack: Alison, Alison, Alison. You could wait tables for a million years and \r\nnever make this kind of money. ",
        "Alison: No, it's just that I don't want to hang on to Barrington money. ",
        "Jack: Well, hey, then spend it. I mean, fix the shop up, make it a place that \r\nyou want to hang out, like you always wanted to make it. And, of course, you can \r\ngive your nice buddy Jack a big raise. ",
        "Alison: Hmm. ",
        "Jack: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: Well, I could use it to make a really sweet cafe. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. And when you start making a profit, you can pay your grandma \r\nback, with interest, if that will make you feel better. ",
        "Alison: Well, there's just only one hitch, though, because the note said I \r\ncan't tell Jamal. ",
        "Jack: So don't tell him. You know, at least for the time being. ",
        "Alison: Well, how am I supposed to explain where all this money came from? \r\nSofa cushions? ",

        "Rhonda: So, I had this great idea, you know. Maybe I'd go to the movies, you \r\nknow, maybe enjoy myself a little. ",
        "Karen: You just left my place, Mom. You never mentioned anything about seeing \r\na movie. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah. Well, I didn't really have the idea till I left your place. \r\nYou know,  just a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. ",
        "Karen: You are the least spur-of-the-moment person I know. ",
        "Rhonda: Well, what, you have to give me the third degree every time I have an \r\nidea? Stop giving me that look. ",
        "Karen: What look, Mom? ",
        "Rhonda: You know, that look like I've done something wrong. ",

        "Karen: Yes, you do. You've been drinking. ",

        "Frank: How about some coffee? ",
        "Karen: How many drinks, Mom? ",
        "Rhonda: Ok. All right. I had one or two. No big deal. ",
        "Karen: You know it is! ",
        "Rhonda: Ok, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it, all right? I know it was \r\nstupid. ",
        "Frank: Look, maybe I should be going. ",
        "Rhonda: No, no, no, no, no. You can stay. You know, when you make a mistake, \r\nyou have to own up. Karen, there is not one day in my life when I don't wake up \r\nand I don't want a drink. I can usually resist it. ",
        "Karen: You just worked so hard to stay sober. What made you fall back? ",
        "Rhonda: I guess it was all that talk about my sister Carolyn. ",
        "Karen: I know you were upset about us finding the picture of her tonight. ",
        "Rhonda: It was all those memories, looking at you, remembering how much you \r\nlooked like her. I couldn't deal with it. ",
        "Frank: So your sister died before Karen was born, right? ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah. I know it was a long time ago, but I miss her so much. That's \r\nwhy I wanted to come to Kelly's tonight. ",
        "Frank: Why here? ",

        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Spunky. I mean, this 25 Gs is some major \r\nbank, ok? I mean, that could be a fat down payment on a house. I mean, and you \r\nneed a decent pair of wheels, too. ",
        "Alison: Look, forget about what I need, ok? This is what I want -- a \r\nsuccessful business, something that we can call our own. ",
