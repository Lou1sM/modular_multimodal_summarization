        "Stunned to learn that Caleb is alive, Livvie vows to take revenge on both Joshua and Rafe for lying to her about his fate. Ashamed of his new life as a mortal, Caleb asks Livvie to turn him back into a vampire. Before Livvie can feed on him through the bars, Joshua's thug pulls her away. Lucy fills Ian in on what happened to Alison. She doesn't understand why she was unable to protect her friend against new vampire Frank. Ian insists on taking Lucy in for some tests. Still worried about her vision of a dead Lucy, Casey goes to the hospital to look for her. Jamal and Casey learn that Lucy hasn't been admitted, but their relief is short-lived when they see Ian help Lucy off the hospital elevator. As Frank awaits Joshua's order to bite Alison, Joshua warns Rafe to put the stake down. Lucy worries about Ian's ability to cope with taking a blood sample. Lucy's test results show nothing more than a slight anemia. Rafe's attempt to protect Alison backfires when Joshua jabs him in the neck with a needle. Joshua assures Alison that he won't hurt her. At Jamal's suggestion, Casey prays for answers, but they realize that she has to figure this out on her own. When Joshua tries to persuade Alison to sit down to tea with him, she accuses him of turning on his sleazy charm again. Joshua informs her that Rafe's fate depends on her cooperation, and he's confident that the two of them will have become much closer by the end of the night. Rafe opens his eyes to discover that he and an angry Livvie share the cell next to Caleb's."

        "Casey: I'm new at this, ok? They're not necessarily dropping a whole lot of 4-1-1 from up there. So I'm doing this totally by ear. But the one thing I do know, jamal, is when we see things this clearly, it usually ain't good.",

        "Rafe: Don't you hurt her.",
        "Joshua: Maybe I will. Then again, maybe I won'T. But this show of devotion between the two of you -- it is so sweet. In fact, it's made me quite sick. But, thankfully, these days they have a remedy for almost everything.",
        "Rafe: You won't get away with this.",

        "Jamal: So, deniece, are you -- are you sure lucy's not here? I mean, are you absolutely sure, positive?",
        "Deniece: I'm still checking. But if lucy had been admitted, I'm sure I would've heard about it, jamal. Nope. Nothing. If lucy's here, then she is not here officially.",
        "Casey: So I was wrong?",
        "Deniece: That's what it looks like. Anything else I can help you with?",
        "Jamal: Nope. No, that's it, deniece.",

        "Casey: Yeyeah, shake it off. That's right.",
        "Jamal: Just shake it off.",
        "Casey: You know, maybe that vision was just some big fluke or something.",
        "Ian: All right, just hold onto me. We're almost there. It's fine. You all right?",
        "Casey: Please tell me that was another fluke vision.",
        "Jamal: That was the real deal, case.",
        "Ian: All right, here we go.",
        "Lucy: This is silly. I am feeling so much better, and we're wasting our time here.",
        "Ian: Why don't you let me worry about that, all right?",
        "Lucy: I want to worry about alison. I am worried about alison --",
        "ian: Ok, lose the jacket.",
        "Cycy: Can't be --",
        "ian: Don't worry about alison right now. We're worried about you. You said you haven't been feeling well for a few days. We're going to get to the bottom of this. Then we'll find alison, find frank. I'm going to have a chat with him about putting his hands on you, the woman I love.",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait. Wait.",
        "Ian: What --",
        "lucy: He a are you ok with this?",
        "Ian: Hey --",
        "lucy: No, but, I mean, shouldn't we get a nurse?",
        "Ian: Who's the patient here? I don't need a nurse. I'm a trained doctor. I'm -- I'm fine. Don't worry about it.",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "ian: I said I'm fine. Let me deal with this.",
        "Livvie: We're both together again, and that's all that matters now. Even these bars --",
        "caleb: How did you get here?",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Caleb: How did you find me?",
        "Livvie: I came with rafe.",
        "Caleb: Rafe?",
        "Livvie: I went to him.",
        "Caleb: Why?",
        "Livvie: I didn't want to live -- not without you. So I went to him and asked him to kill me.",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Livvie: I wanted to be with you so much, caleb. I thought you were dead.",
        "Caleb: He refused you. You went to him to kill you, and he said no, right?",
        "Livvie: Well, once that rafe told me that it was joshua ttt betrayed you, it gave me a purpose. He had to be punished for what he did to you. I knew if I came here, I could find a way somehow, give you your final revenge on him. I never expected to find you alive.",
        "Caleb: Rafe never told you?",
        "Livvie: What? He knew all along, didn't he?",
        "Caleb: And so did joshua. They used you. They knew, and they kept it from you.",
        "Livvie: Really? Well, it seems to me like I have a little revenge of my o to plan. And I will enjoy seeing both of them suffer for lying to me.",
        "Caleb: I'm just glad you're safe, that neither one of them hurt you.",
        "Livvie: Because of you, joshua couldn'T. And I know as -- as long as I had your ring, I was safe.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. He tried to take it from you, didn't he?",
        "Livvie: Yes, of course he did. Once he touched it, he got the shock of his life. I guess that's what you meant by keeping me safe.",
        "Caleb: From other vampires. That's why no matter what -- no matter what happens to me, you can vever take that off, all right? Never take off the ring. Swear it to me.",
        "Livvie: Ok. I swear. I promise. Joshua knows about the ring, doesn't he? He knows about the magic it has?",
        "Caleb: Don't let joshua scare you.",
        "Livvie: I'll try. I'll try, but --",
        "caleb: But what?",
        "Livvie: Caleb, what if he comes down here and sees us like this and he tries to force it away from me and he tries to take it? What if that happens?",
        "Caleb: No. I'll protect you.",
        "Livvie: How?",
        "Caleb: Somehow. We have to find a way for you to feed on me, that's all.",
        "Livvie: And turn you back into a vampire?",
        "Caleb: Yes. Yes.",
        "Livvie: Caleb -- no, no!",
        "Caleb: No!",
        "Livvie: No, caleb!",
        "Caleb: No! No! No.",
        "Alison: You say that you're not going to hurt him, but I don't believe you.",
        "Joshua: Garbage day, frank. Thank you.",
        "Alison: What? What are you -- why -- what are you doing with him?",
        "Joshua: I told you not to worry.",
        "Alison: I heard what you said. Where are you taking him?",
        "Joshua: You have a problem believing me?",
        "Alison: He's just -- what -- what are you going to do?",
        "Joshua: Now? What am I going to do now, right this very moment? I'm going to have a spot of tea. There's enough for two. Will you join me?",
        "Alison: No, never.",
        "Joshua: Just for tea, alison. Only tea.",
        "Alison: My god. You have made such a big mistake.",
        "Joshua: I'm sorry, did you want coffee? I never touch the stuff myself -- too much caffeine. It makes me jumpy, makes my fangs chatter.",
        "Alison: You have no idea what you've done. You are way over your head.",
        "Joshua: Oh?",
        "Alison: What, have you been a vampire for only a couple of weeks now? And who turned you? My mother, of all people?",
        "Joshua: Oh, yes, dear elizabeth. Here's to her.",
        "Alison: Go to hell.",
        "Joshua: I'll wash your mouth out with soap.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god. You haven't even heard the first of it yet, have you?",
        "Joshua: Sugar?",
        "Alison: Just tell me, please, what you're going to do with rafe.",
        "Joshua: I don't know. I haven't quite decided. So much of that depends on you, alison.",
        "Alison: Me?",
        "Joshua: Your cooperation.",
        "Alison: My cooperation? Oh, I see. You're going to turn on your sleazy, little cha like you did in capri, aren't you?",
        "Joshua: Oh, yes. We'll always have capri, won't we? Oh, by the way, I haven't had the opportunity to thank you properly. If your mother hadn't rushed to your defense, well, I wouldn't be who I am today. Thank you.",
        "Alison: You should be dead.",
        "Joshua: You know, you're so feisty. That's what I love about you.",
        "Alison: You know nothing about me, joshua.",
        "Joshua: On the contrary, alison, I know quite a great deal about you. And, more importantly, by the time this night is through, I'm going to know so much more.",
        "Casey: What -- what room did deniece say ian --",
        "jamal: 612 -- the only empty one on the floor.",
        "Casey: 612.",
        "Jamal: And I bet you nobody's in there, right? Right?",
        "Casey: My god. Jamal, it happened. My vision came true. Lucy's going to die --",
        "jamal: Hey, whoa, whoa, stop, stop. Stop. You can't just go in there talking about how lucy's going to die.",
        "Casey: Wait. Ian.",

        "Ian: According to the lab, everything seems fine.",
        "Lucy: \"Seems\"?",
        "Ian: Nay, it is. All the tests look good. Apart -- you know, you're slightly anemic, but that's to be expected, the stress you've been under lately.",
        "Jamal: Oh, thank god.",
        "Casey: Whew. So lucy's ok?",
        "Jamal: Yep, sounds like it. So I guess your vision was wrong.",
        "Casey: No, no, I know what I saw. It was clear as day. It was, like, right there, right in front of my eyes.",
        "Jamal: Well, you heard him.",
        "Casey: I heard him, but -- ok, then what did I see, then, huh?",

        "Jamal: Maybe, like, the phone lines are down or something. Maybe they didn't pay their bill.",
        "Casey: No. Dedicated phone lines open 24/7. We're always connected. We all are.",
        "Jamal: Maybe that's your answer, then.",
        "Casey: What answer?",
        "Jamal: You know, maybe it's a mystery for you to fige e out all on your own.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Right. Only how soon do I have before everything starts going wrong, jamal? Is lucy the reason why I'm here? Is she part of the reason why I came here? Am I sposed to be guardian-angeling her, too?",
        "Ian: So you're up to this?",
