        "Lucy: Mmm. Hmm. Why? ",
        "Kevin: You have to ask? ",
        "Lucy: No. I don't mean about that. I mean, it was pretty darn, darn -- ",
        "Kevin: Incredible. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. ",
        "Kevin: Incredible. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. It's just, Doc, it's all been incredible. I mean, everything is \r\nwonderful and amazing and awesome, and I don't understand it. Why is all of a \r\nsudden everything working out between us? ",
        "Kevin: You want to know why? Because we're not fighting it. ",
        "Lucy: Not fighting what? ",
        "Kevin: Not fighting loving each other. ",
        "Lucy: Mmm. Ooh, this is nice, isn't it? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: It's going to get a lot nicer, too. ",
        "Lucy: So, I mean, on that subject, what is next for us? ",
        "Kevin: Breakfast. I'll meet you downstairs? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Order me some coffee. ",
        "Kevin and Lucy: Decaf. ",

        "Lucy: Yes, hello. Mr. Silver, please. Yes, it's Lucy Coe. Hi, Richard. \r\nListen, I just want to confirm our breakfast meeting this morning at the Port \r\nCharles Grill. It's still on, yes? Oh, good. No. Kevin is very anxious to have \r\nhis divorce finalized, really. No, no, no, no, I'll recognize you. You're a \r\nlawyer, right? You'll be in a, what, dark suit, kind of blue, with maybe a \r\nstriped tie, and you'll have a briefcase, of course. I'll see you then. ",

        "Jamal: There's more? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, lots. ",
        "Jamal: I thought you said you were starting off small, this was it. ",
        "Alison: Well, I know, but the place was auctioning off everything we needed, so \r\nI had to move. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and -- and at those prices, this stuff would've never lasted.\r\n",
        "Jamal: I'm almost afraid to ask how much this all cost. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, it was a steal. ",
        "Jamal: You think you could be a little more specific? ",
        "Jack: You know what? Livvie and I'll just be getting the other stuff. ",

        "Jamal: Ok, well, then how much of the $25,000 bond money you got left, then?\r\n",
        "Alison: Ahem. Well, uh, technically nothing. ",
        "Jamal: You spent 25 grand in one morning? You're down to zero, Ali? ",

        "Ian: Hepatin's kicking full throttle now. ",
        "Karen: Well, that's great. Ups the chance that she could survive the liver \r\ntransplant. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Now all we need's a liver. ",
        "Karen: Ian, you need to get some rest. You look like hell. ",

        "Karen: I guess it's going around. But you really need to get some rest. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Have you talked to Eve today? ",
        "Karen: Not yet. Why? ",
        "Ian: Just want to make sure she's ok. ",
        "Karen: \"Ok?\" ",

        "Eve: Yeah. Yeah, I needed to take a break from the hospital, to just kind of take \r\ncare of me for a little bit. ",
        "Kevin: Why don't I take care of you? ",

        "Jamal: Whoo! 25 grand. You spent 25 grand-plus on a coffee machine and a \r\ncouple of chairs. ",

        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, 25 grand. 25 grand. That's a lot of blueberry muffins \r\nthere, Spunky. ",
        "Alison: Look, I got to go, ok? My nana's expecting me at the hospital. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, and this ought to brighten her sickroom, you know, just knowing \r\nthat you have all this money just to burn like this. Come on. ",
        "Alison: Nana has always been one for good business deals, ok, and this is good \r\nbusiness. Bye. ",

        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Livvie: Are you off to the hospital now? ",

        "Alison: Ok, thank you. You're the best. ",
        "Jack: No, your nana's the best. She's the one who flipped out 25 Gs. ",

        "Karen: I know, but Eve -- ",

        "Karen: Well, maybe they'll return mine. ",
        "Ian: I doubt it. ",
        "Karen: Hey, I could always try. Maybe after losing their son, they'll realize \r\nhow precious their daughter's life is. ",

        "Kevin: Why not? ",
        "Eve: It's complicated. He feels his place is with Arianna, making sure that \r\nshe gets better. ",
        "Kevin: And you agree with that? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: So what are you going to do? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. I can't eat or sleep. I can barely even work. I mean, I \r\nhad to take myself off of Arianna's case because I couldn't handle it. I \r\ncouldn't handle the way I was feeling. ",
        "Kevin: You were right to do that. You need to take care of yourself. ",

        "Livvie: I didn't mention that? ",

        "Amanda: Oh, my goodness. How did you afford it? ",
        "Alison: Well, a very wonderful and very generous person sent me a key to a \r\npost office box, and inside was a very large bag of money. ",
        "Amanda: Well, if you don't want to tell me, I won't push you. ",
