        "Lucy takes offense at Elizabeth's sincere compliment that they are very much alike. While trying to gain Frank's trust over a beer, Ian sets a trap to force the new vampire to reveal his true nature. Smelling the blood in Ian's bag, Frank follows him to the alley, where he \"catches\" Ian preparing to drink the blood. Surprised to learn that Ian is also a vampire, Frank strongly advises the doctor to accept it. Joshua calls with a new assignment for Frank. Ian provokes Frank into an attack and gains the upper hand. Livvie's blood hunger leaves her in agony. Alison is forced to share Caleb's cell. Joshua amuses himself with the current living arrangements in the dungeon. Livvie vows not to give Joshua the ring. Joshua informs her that sex with a slayer will relieve the pain. Elizabeth finds a set of vampire wedding rings belonging to Joshua. Lucy hides when Joshua shows up, but Elizabeth pretends to believe the ring is for her, and to Joshua's disbelief, she accepts the proposal he had no intention of making. Although Livvie and Rafe vow to never sleep together, the pain is too much for the hungry vamp. His lip quivering, Caleb forces himself to allow her to do whatever it takes. When Rafe continues to refuse, Caleb manages to get his arm within range of Livvie's mouth, and she feeds on him."

        "Elizabeth: God, this whole thing is my fault.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Elizabeth: I mean, if i hadn't turned into a vampire in the first place, he wouldn't have the kind of power to even pull this off.",
        "Lucy: You know, now's not really the time for blame. This is not the time. Focus.",
        "Elizabeth: Lucy, I didn't have a choice. I mean, he -- I didn't know it was going to turn into this, so --",
        "lucy: Hmm. I see. So what you've done is you've placed the blame on yourself for a minute, and then you absolved yourself of guilt the next minute. That's very quick, very clever. Come on.",
        "Elizabeth: Lucy, I know that you never really liked me very much.",
        "Lucy: True.",
        "Elizabeth: But now I know why.",
        "Lucy: Ok, I guess I'm going to have to stand here and let you tell me. Go ahead.",
        "Elizabeth: We're very much alike, you know.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my god, we are not.",
        "Elizabeth: We are. It's a compliment. It's ok.",
        "Lucy: Ew! This is going to be a long, long night. Come on.",
        "Frank: So lucy's been like this for a while?",
        "Ian: Hmm, ever since that -- that explosion down by the dock. I'm sure you heard about it.",
        "Frank: Where all the vampires got cured? Yeah, I heard about it.",
        "Ian: Really?",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Ian: Because that wasn't on the news, you know. It wasn't about the vampires, just about the explosion.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you -- you hear all sorts of rumors about caleb and whoever else.",
        "Ian: That's port charles for you, right -- plenty of rumors. I mean, that's why lucy called you a vampire.",
        "Frank: Yeah, right.",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Frank: She went too far this time.",
        "Ian: I agree.",
        "Frank: You've got your hands full with that one, you know that?",
        "Ian: I know, I know.",
        "Frank: What's in the bag?",
        "Ian: Nothing. I'm going to go make a phone call. Why don't you, uh -- why don't you get us another round, ok?",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "[Dog barks]",
        "ian: What are you doing?",
        "Frank: I think what you're doing is the more interesting question.",
        "Livvie: This pain -- it hurts so much.",
        "Caleb: I know. I know. You just need to feed.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I'm a slayer. She can't feed on me.",
        "Caleb: I know she can't feed on you.",
        "Livvie: Ow! God, i can't take this, caleb!",
        "Caleb: Listen, you got to fight your way through it, ok? Just -- I wish i could get to you.",
        "Rafe: I could help her if you show me how to get out of here.",
        "Caleb: I already told you there's no way out of here!",
        "Rafe: All right, fine! Then i guess you're going to have to watch her suffer!",
        "Caleb: You don't know what the pain is like!",
        "Joshua: Ah, I love reunions.",
        "Alison: Rafe!",
        "Joshua: I hope you're all decent.",

        "Rafe: You ok?",
        "[Alison screams]",
        "rafe: Hey, leave her alone!",
        "Joshua: I'm afraid you can't be with your boyfriend, sweetheart. I have different cellmate for you.",

        "ian: Just getting some air.",
        "Frank: Never would've guessed it. You're a vampire.",
        "Ian: What are you talking about?",
        "Frank: I know normal people don't hide in the alley, guzzling o-negative.",
        "Ian: No one's supposed to know I'm --",
        "frank: What, that you're the same as me?",
        "Ian: You? So lucy was right.",
        "Frank: Yeah, she was. You and lucy, huh? A vampire and a slayer? That doesn't make sense.",
        "Ian: Opposites attract, I guess.",
        "Frank: Does she know?",
        "Ian: Yeah, she knows, and she's been -- she's been helping me fight this, but i get these urges, this hunger, and --",
        "frank: Take you over a little more each day?",
        "Ian: God, i hate it. I can't handle it.",
        "Frank: Well, you'd better get used to it, pal.",
        "Ian: Maybe you can help me.",
        "Frank: Help you?",
        "Ian: Help me fight -- fight this curse.",
        "Frank: See, i'm not so sure that it is a curse.",
        "Ian: What are you saying, you've come to terms with this? You've made your peace with it? How?",
        "Frank: You just take the cards you're dealt and find the best in the situation.",
        "Ian: \"The best in the situation\"? I can't even face myself in the mirror. I can't be a doctor, i can't be a good father.",
        "Frank: You just have to accept your life as you knew it is over.",
        "Ian: You've made your peace with this? You're ok joining forces with someone like joshua?",
        "Frank: Ok, you can stop now, ian.",
        "Ian: Stop what?",
        "Frank: This little game of comparing notes.",
        "Ian: That's not what i'm doing. I'm asking --",
        "frank: Hey, i am a vampire, ian, not an idiot. You're trying to find out where alison is. That's what you're up to, isn't it?",
        "Elizabeth: Ow. Ow.",
        "Lucy: Would you shush?",
        "Elizabeth: Sorry. It's dark in here. I can't see.",
        "Lucy: Yes, it is dark. When you break into somebody's place, it's supposed to be dark. Oh, yeah, wait a minute, wait a minute. Ah. Ok. Is that better?",
        "Elizabeth: That's more productive, thank you.",
        "Lucy: Great.",
        "Lucy: Could we maybe perhaps just spread out a little bit?",
        "Elizabeth: By all means.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. So what is this place?",
        "Elizabeth: It's joshua's little hideaway. It's where he conducts all of his personal business.",
        "Lucy: \"Personal --\" oh, my gosh, you and -- ew!",
        "Elizabeth: Just please, just please don't remind me, ok? I wasn't exactly myself. Believe me, when i think of that bastard --",
        "lucy: Ok.",
        "Elizabeth: With my little girl --",
        "lucy: I know. Hey. Whoops. Don't think. Let's look.",
        "Elizabeth: I know. I was just -- I was just hoping that we would find them here, that they would be here.",
        "Lucy: Well, guess what -- they're not here. And that means joshua could be back any minute.",
        "Elizabeth: I know, but I thought you said that ian and rafe already searched this place top to bottom.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, they did. But you know what? Sometimes it takes a woman who actually slept with a man to know his innermost secrets. So come on, tell me, what do you think? Where does a creep like joshua keep all the skeletons in his closet hidden, huh? Come on.",
        "Alison: Get your hands off of me.",
        "Joshua: Oh, don't worry, he won't bite. You can't anymore, can you, caleb?",
        "Caleb: Olivia needs to feed.",
        "Joshua: I figured she would.",
        "Caleb: What are you going to do?",
        "Joshua: Absolutely nothing. She knows what it'll take to make the pain go away.",
        "Livvie: I'll never give you this ring, you son of a --",
        "joshua: Really? I don't know how you two gentlemen put up with such uncooperative mates.",
        "Rafe: What are you planning on doing with us?",
        "Joshua: I'm going to amuse myself. Come on, you have to see the humor in it -- your sweetheart locked up with your sworn enemy and slayer in a cell with a vampire? Now, let's face it, folks -- that's entertainment.",
        "Livvie: Oh. Caleb, please, it hurts.",
        "Joshua: What? You don't see the humor in it, either?",
        "Caleb: Listen to me -- she's in agony. Now, i know you hate me --",
        "joshua: That is an understatement. And this is a very painful way to go. I know the agony is excruciating. In fact, didn't you teach me that? Wasn't that one of the life's lessons that i learned in master caleb's class?",
        "Caleb: Joshua --",
        "joshua: Of course, she's rooming with a slayer. He could put her out of her misery.",
        "Rafe: There's only one person here i want to put out.",
        "Joshua: Well, the problem with that is you're in there and I'm out here.",
        "Alison: Wait, he just wants to torture us. Don't even listen to him, ok? It's all right, it's all right.",
        "Livvie: Oh. Please, it hurts. It hurts.",
        "Caleb: I know. Damn you, joshua.",
        "Joshua: What? Did I hear a \"please\"?",
        "Caleb: Help her. Please.",
        "Joshua: I want that ring.",
        "Caleb: If she gives you the ring, you'll kill her.",
        "Joshua: And if she doesn't? Well, you can see. Remember all those tests you were always putting me through?",
        "Caleb: So, what, she's payback?",
        "Joshua: I learned from the finest.",
        "[Livvie groans]",
        "livvie: Oh, caleb. It's like I'm on fire.",
        "Caleb: Olivia --",
        "joshua: All right. Let's make this more interesting. There is another way that she can feel better. Isn't that right, rafe?",
        "Caleb: Vampires can't feed on a slayer.",
        "Joshua: Oh, come on, people, let's use our imaginations, please.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god.",
        "Joshua: Yes. You got it, princess. All livvie has to do to feel better is to sleep with a slayer.",
        "Caleb: Bastard.",
        "Joshua: Oh, come on, all the name-calling in the world will not solve your problems. If rafe sleeps with livvie, she'll get instant relief. Your enemy can save your girlfriend's life.",
        "Caleb: Forget it.",
        "Joshua: Whatever. I'm going to leave you four to sort this out. You might even kill each other in the process.",
        "ian: I'm fighting this. Why can't you?",
        "Frank: There's nothing to fight. I'm on the winning team for a change. And if you're smart, you'll realize that.",
        "Ian: Joshua's team isn't going to win a bloody thing. Now, where is alison?",
        "Frank: He didn't tell me.",
        "Ian: And you're ok with that?",
        "Frank: I had a job to do and I did it.",
        "Ian: You did your job. You're a good boy. Now, bring her back here.",
        "Frank: Don't be such a hero, ian. You won't win this one.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "frank: Yeah, this is frank.",
        "Joshua: Where are you?",
        "Frank: I'm tying up loose ends.",
        "Joshua: Then wrap it up. I have a new assignment for you.",
        "Lucy: So did you find anything?",
        "Elizabeth: No, nothing here.",
        "[Thud]",
        "lucy: Oh, my goodness! Elizabeth, what do you want to do, send a telegram that we're in here?",
        "Elizabeth: Just chill. Stop talking to me like I'm some kind of an idiot. Is that what you think?",
        "Lucy: Uh, you know, at this point, i don't think you want to know what I think about you.",
        "lucy: Listen, I don't hate you. I think you are a self-absorbed, narcissistic, train wreck of a human being, but, hey, i don't hate you.",
        "Elizabeth: You know, it's true.",
        "Lucy: Oh -- I'm sorry, ok, I'm sorry. Listen, a lot of us did a lot of crazy things since caleb flew into town, ok?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, but I married him. The gift that keeps on giving.",
        "Lucy: Don't do this, elizabeth. Elizabeth --",
        "elizabeth: You know, lucy, whatever you think of me, I love my daughter. I would give my life for her.",
        "Lucy: I know. I know that. I get it. I know.",
        "Elizabeth: And I know that i have let her down time and time again, but I keep trying, ok? I'm trying to be a better person. I may never get that chance.",
        "Lucy: You will. You'll get that chance, I promise you. We will get alison back and you'll get the chance, ok, I promise. Don't lose it now. Stay with me.",
        "Elizabeth: Why does he keep these handkerchiefs?",
        "Lucy: Elizabeth --",
        "elizabeth: God, i found something.",
        "Lucy: Really? What? What is that?",
        "Elizabeth: My god. I must say, he has excellent taste.",
        "Lucy: No, he doesn't. He doesn't have excellent taste. You know what these are? These are -- vampire wedding rings. Oh, my god. The question is, who does our charming little bat plan on marrying?",
        "Livvie: Is what joshua said true? If i sleep with a slayer --",
        "rafe: Your symptoms will vanish. I didn't even know until recently. I don't know how joshua did. Unless -- you. You knew?",
        "Caleb: There's a few things we don't like to share with our enemies.",
        "Rafe: Oh, that's great. That's great, caleb. Just add a little more spice to his little game, huh?",
        "Alison: Listen, I think he's just trying to play mind games with us, that's it.",
        "Livvie: I only want you.",
        "Caleb: I know.",
        "Alison: Livvie, don't you even think --",
        "livvie: Stop it! I'm not! I'd rather be in pain than -- than be with anyone else.",
        "Caleb: Hey. Hey. Look, you listen to me, all right? I will find a way to get to you. I will find a way to get to you.",
        "Alison: I just can't even believe this. I can't even believe this situation. When they dragged you out of here, i didn't know what was going to happen to you. I had no -- I started thinking all these bad thoughts.",
        "Rafe: I know, I know. It's ok, it's ok. Now, what did joshua do to you? Why are you wearing that dress?",
        "Alison: I don't know, he just -- he made me put it on.",
        "Rafe: What did he do? Did he hurt you?",
        "Alison: No, he just wanted to make it look like we were on some date or something and he wanted to know about me. He was asking all kinds of personal questions.",
        "Rafe: So how did this happen? How did this happen? You were supposed to be safe at lucy'S.",
        "Alison: I know! I know, we were, but then frank showed up and we didn't know that he was one of them until it was too late.",
        "Rafe: That must mean that joshua and his crew are growing stronger.",
        "Caleb: Hey. Hey. Stay with me, sweetheart, all right? You got to fight the pain.",
        "Livvie: I'm trying.",
        "Caleb: This is all my fault. If i never would've turned you, you -- you wouldn't be in this pain.",
        "Livvie: No. No, I would've never had the chance to be with you forever. If you could just hold me in your hands, it would make it bearable.",
        "Caleb: Then imagine my hand in yours, touching your skin, bringing you nothing but pleasure.",
        "Livvie: Caleb? I'm scared. Am i going to die?",
        "Caleb: I won't let you. I won't let you. Olivia? I love you. And I -- I can't bear the thought of you being with --",
        "livvie: I know. I know.",
        "Caleb: Do what you have to do to save yourself.",
        "Frank: I'll take care of it, sir, right away.",
        "Ian: Was that joshua?",
        "Frank: Don't be a fool, ian. You're in over your head on this one. Stay out of this.",
        "Ian: Can't do that.",
        "Frank: Then get out of my way.",
        "Ian: What happened to you? We were friends.",
        "Frank: Apparently, not anymore.",
        "Ian: Do the right thing and help alison.",
        "Frank: Don't you get it, thornhart? I am tired of doing the right thing. Where's it gotten me? I've been in trouble for a long time and you never noticed. You sat in my bar night after night and never saw what was happening to me.",
        "Ian: You're right. I'm sorry. What can i do now?",
        "Frank: Just don't pretend you feel my pain and get out of my way.",
        "Ian: I can't do that, frank. We're going to have a problem. Because I'm not leaving before you tell me where alison is.",
        "Frank: I said get out of my way, ian.",
        "Ian: What are you going to do, kill me?",
        "Frank: If i have to.",
        "Ian: Oh, frank, frank, frank. We've been friends for a long time. It's going to end like this? You don't have the chops for this. I've been a vampire a lot longer than you.",
        "Frank: I'm warning you, thornhart.",
        "Ian: Go ahead.",

        "[dog barks]",
        "ian: I have no quarrel with you. I want joshua.",
        "Lucy: Are you as creeped-out by this as i am?",
        "Elizabeth: I'm confused. You know, he's talked about destruction and killing, but he never once mentioned any kind of a marriage. Something -- something is very wrong here.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You are so right something's really wrong. Wait a minute. You know, we found pictures that joshua had taken of alison and of livvie. That must mean that one of those lucky ladies is going to get a swell marriage proposal, huh?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no, he will marry alison over my dead body.",
        "Lucy: Oh, don't say that. Don't even think it. He would probably enjoy that.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, my god, what if he's -- what if he's already bitten her? What -- what if he turned her?",
        "Lucy: It's ok, elizabeth. Stay with me, stay with me. We're going to go find rafe and he's going to help us get to the bottom --",

        "Elizabeth: You are such -- such a darling. When were you going to tell me?",
        "Joshua: Tell you what?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, come on, don't deny it. I know you were going to surprise me. You were going to ask me to marry you.",
        "Joshua: Are you crazy?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, the answer is yes. Oh, yes, of course i will. I will. I will.",
        "Rafe: Livvie, we can't do this.",
        "Livvie: I don't want to die.",
        "Caleb: Come to me, olivia. Take my blood. Take it.",
        "Caleb: I told you i'd take care of you. Joshua can't touch us.",
        "Alison: Rafe, is that ok?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it's fine. She can't turn him by feeding that way.",
