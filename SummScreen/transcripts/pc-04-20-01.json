        "Alison: Also, by the way -- I did decide to tell Jamal the truth about the \r\nmoney actually coming from Nana. ",
        "Jack: Today? ",
        "Alison: No. Are you crazy? Yeah, I would, but, you know, he's just having too \r\nmuch fun. I don't want to ruin it. ",
        "Jack: Well, Alison, do me a favor. When you decide to tell him, let me know.\r\n",

        "Frank: This -- this shouldn't even be working, much less communicating. No, \r\nno, no, that -- it can't be happening. I am not talking to the past. I mean, \r\nthat's -- that's crazy. It would mean I'm crazy. ",
        "Frank: Hey, Victor? It's Frank. I really need your help. Meet me at Kelly's. \r\nI can't explain right now. I need you to bring that equipment you used to test \r\nhow old Mom's antique desk was. That's pretty accurate, right? Good. I need -- I \r\nneed to test how old an engraving is. ",

        "Ian: Well, don't worry about it. We'll -- we'll get you ready in time. ",
        "Arianna: What about a donor? I know that the best chance for a match is \r\nthrough a family member. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. No, it's a little more difficult to find a donor that's not \r\nrelated, but it's not impossible. ",
        "Arianna: I have a sister, and her and I have been always really, really \r\nclose. If there's any chance we can get in touch with her -- ",

        "Frank: What -- you're kidding. That fast? Well, what's it say? ",
        "Victor: From all I can see, the name was scratched into the wood about 25, 30 \r\nyears ago. ",
        "Frank: So it really could have been put there, say, in 1973. ",
        "Victor: That's 28 years. Yeah, absolutely. Does -- does that answer your \r\nquestion? Frank -- Frank? ",
        "Frank: What? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's -- that's great, Victor, thanks. ",

        "Victor: Anytime. Call me if you need something. I'm also available to check \r\nout hearts carved in tree trunks. ",
        "Frank: I will. 1973. If you're telling the truth, Cookie, that -- oh, come \r\non, Frank. Listen to yourself. It is not possible. It is the punch line to a bad \r\njoke. Unless -- ",

        "Cookie: It works, I swear. Well, this guy I'm talking with, he's been telling \r\nme all kinds of stuff that hasn't happened yet. Know why? ",
        "Scotty: Nah, don't tell me -- he thinks he's Kreskin. ",
        "Cookie: It's even better than that. He's living in the year 2001. ",
        "Scotty: I got a news flash for you. This guy's up in Sing Sing in a \r\nstraitjacket. ",

        "Karen: No, you've got this all wrong. I -- ",
        "Eve: Honey, I know the signs. You're hiding in the bathroom. I see what you \r\nhad in your hand. I see what you have on your arm. ",
        "Karen: Would you listen to me? ",
        "Eve: No, you listen to me! And if I have to get tough with you, then so be \r\nit! There is no way I am going to let you go through this again. ",

        "Lucy: Well, I -- you know, I -- I told you both that I was trying to help \r\ntake care of something that you've both been too busy to deal with, and that was \r\npartially right at the time. That's what I was thinking at the time. ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. And what about now? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I've also been thinking right now, and I realize I'm -- I am \r\nselfish. I wanted that divorce. I want you divorced. I do because -- I'm not \r\nexactly sure why. You are very furious with me, aren't you? ",

        "Lucy: I got -- I got excited. Well, I know that sounds weird, but I was \r\nexcited because you wanted the divorce, that you were ready to put that part of \r\nyour life behind you, and so then the idea just popped into my head. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you're not threatened by my relationship with Eve, are you? \r\nBecause you don't have to be. ",

        "Lucy: It's us. Doc, you know -- every time I think everything's going to work \r\nout between us, something happens. Every time I get my hopes up and my dreams \r\nthat we are going to be ok, we're going to be fine, something happens to us. ",

        "Lucy: I know that. I mean, I think I know that, but my brain gets busy, you \r\nknow. It just starts racing, and I get things sort of twisted and turned around, \r\nand I think I need a reminder, so, oh, my goodness, I go right out there and I'm \r\ngoing to get that reminder. ",
