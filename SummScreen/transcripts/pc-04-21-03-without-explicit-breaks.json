        "Reese tries an unsuccessful solo act, unaware that Jack is seated at the bar. After barging into Kevin's art studio uninvited, Karen is shocked by what she sees on the canvas, which is Kevin's view of Port Charles. When she tries to drag him away for some fun, Kevin warns her that Port Charles is going to get much scarier. Obsessed with his painting, he tells her to go away and let him work. Elizabeth keeps up the pretense of believing that Joshua intends to propose. Joshua has no intention of saddling himself with such an annoying woman--until she reminds him of how good they are together. Joshua agrees to take her back if she will become a vampire again. Thinking that Jamal needs cheering up, Casey invites him to the Recovery Room for Pizza and beer. After a call from Jack, Ricky gathers the troops to help out a friend. Ian goads Frank into taking him to Joshua. While Elizabeth distracts Joshua, Lucy searches the closet for something to use as a weapon against the vampire. As Jack rounds up an audience, Ricky, Casey, Jamal, and Caz arrive at the bar. The band performs \"Hey, Sister\" for an appreciative crowd. Reese is thrilled by Jack's gesture. As Joshua prepares to bite Elizabeth, Lucy bursts out of the closet wielding a piece of a wooden hanger. Frank arrives with Ian and exposes Elizabeth's duplicity. Joshua challenges Lucy to fight him to the death."

        "Lucy's voice: Aha! I could start a fire.",
        "Elizabeth: And you know what kind of woman I am. Lord knows you've told me enough. I'm basically selfish. I care about myself and no one else, so, therefore, I want you because of what you can give to me. No other reason. And remember, there are those other talents that I have, which, at the very least, could keep you amused.",
        "Joshua: Even though I hate to admit it, thalilile thing you do does make me very happy even when I know you're lying.",

        "Joshua: Oh, my darling, you have just begged me so beautifully, you've actually managed to change my mind. Can you imagine that?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh.",
        "Joshua: And not to mention, you are something else in the bedroom.",
