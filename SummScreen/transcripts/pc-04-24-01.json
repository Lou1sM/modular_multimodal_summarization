        "Chris: Would you believe the computer doesn't search the registry any faster \r\nthan the speed of light? ",
        "Ian: Maybe you should save the sarcasm until we know that Arianna's going to \r\nlive. ",
        "Chris: Look, if you want to help Arianna, then work on her frame of mind. As \r\nlong as she's convinced she's going to die, she's going to. ",
        "Joe: I've been thinking about that. We ought to consider an antidepressant.\r\n",
        "Chris: That's a good idea. I'll talk to Eve. ",
        "Ian: No, you won't. ",
        "Chris: Why not? She just found a drug for a cancer patient -- ",
        "Ian: I don't care what she's found. She's off the case. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, but if she already knows what -- ",
        "Ian: Are you deaf, the both of you? I don't you want you mentioning Eve and \r\nArianna in the same sentence, do you understand that? ",
        "Eve: I don't. ",

        "Girl: No, not Elly May. Granny. You know, Irene Ryan? Ooh, they say she's \r\nreally sick. ",
        "Second Girl: Oh, come on, nobody's sicker than Elly May. I mean, did you see \r\nher clothes? ",
        "First Girl: Ew. ",
        "Second Girl: That accent? What a hick. ",
        "Cookie: Hi, Barb. Hey, Marcie. ",

        "Frank: \"You are the only friend she has.\" And now you're talking to me! Oh, \r\now. Oh, man. Oh, what am I doing? I'm talking out loud to an old machine. I must \r\nhave drunk more than I thought. I got to -- I got to get out of here. Oh -- let \r\n-- let -- let go! Let go of me! ",

        "Waitress: Whatever. Nobody named Frank's been in looking for nobody. Sorry.\r\n",
        "Cookie: Yeah. Me, too. So, you and Marcie are on the dance committee, huh? I \r\nknow I can't wait. ",
        "Barb: For what? ",
        "Marcie: You're not going, are you? ",
        "Cookie: Well, why not? ",

        "Frank: Ok, ok, I got the message. I got it. Why is it so important for me to \r\nhelp Cookie? What -- what's she going to do? ",
        "Cookie: I'll be at the dance. You just watch. ",
        "Marcie: You mean standing around with the chaperone parents? ",
        "Cookie: I mean with my date. Just wait and see who I walk in with. Then I'll \r\nbe the one who's laughing. ",
        "Barb: Ooh! Give us a hint of who it'll be, Biscuit. Please. ",
        "Cookie: Cookie. Just wait. You'll see. Oh, God. Why did I say I had a date?\r\n",
        "",
        "Frank: This can't happen. Computers can't snag you and not let go. They can't \r\nconnect you with somebody 28 years in the past and they can't -- ah! Aha! You \r\nare not going to suck me in, you got that? Not -- not if I don't let you. Not if \r\nI fight back! ",
        "Karen: Who are you talking to, Frank? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Eve -- ",
        "Eve: Sorry. I was just doing research on one of my peds patients, but I can \r\ncome back later if you want. ",
        "Ian: No, don't go. ",
        "Eve: Are you sure? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I'm a little edgy. I haven't slept much is all. ",
        "Eve: You know, just because I took myself off of Arianna's case doesn't mean \r\nthat you can't talk to me about it. You know, I mean, how's she doing? Have you \r\nfound a donor yet? ",
        "Joe: Well, Ian did a hell of a job getting the word out. We got people lined \r\nup to be tested. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, there might not be a match. ",
        "Eve: Well how are her numbers? ",
        "Chris: She's still critical, but the numbers are getting better. She should \r\nbe ready for transplant soon. ",
        "Ian: Arianna might be ready, but we may not be. ",
        "Joe: You never know. The perfect match could just be right around the corner.\r\n",
        "Karen's Voice: Oh, I don't know what to do. This is a big step. ",
        "Eve's Voice: Look, you're my best friend. If this decision is too tough for \r\nyou, we will find another donor. ",
        "Karen: Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on Arianna. She doesn't have much \r\ntime. ",
        "Ian: You all right? Because if this is getting to you -- ",
        "Eve: No, I'm fine. Everything's going to be just fine. ",

        "Karen: The computer's what? ",
        "Frank: It's talking to me, Karen. ",
        "Karen: Out loud? ",
        "Frank: No, it -- it types. ",
        "Karen: All by itself? ",
        "Frank: Look, I know this all sounds crazy, and I wouldn't believe it myself \r\nif I hadn't connected to 1973 a little while ago. ",
        "Karen: You what? ",
        "Frank: It's where she lives. ",
        "Karen: Who lives, Frank? ",
        "Frank: Cookie! Cookie! It's the answer to the mystery, Karen. This -- this \r\ncomputer is like some kind of time machine or something. Watch. Watch, I'll show \r\nyou. Ok, Nellie, I'm here. Talk -- talk to me more about cookie. Why am I her \r\nonly friend? How do you want me to help her? Oh, come on. Come on, Nellie, don't \r\nmake me look like an idiot. ",
        "Karen: Frank -- ",
        "Frank: Hang on. Just give us a minute. ",
        "Karen: \"Us?\" ",
        "Frank: Say something, Nellie. Type something. Come on, come on! What is going \r\nto happen to Cookie? ",
        "Karen: You bastard. Knowing how upset I was about my mother falling off the \r\nwagon? This is what you did for fun? You went out and got drunk? ",
        "Frank: Look, Karen, I can explain. ",
        "Karen: I don't need your explanation and I don't need you! ",

        "Ian: We got all these volunteers, not one of them is a good enough match. ",
        "Chris: You know how this works. You put out word for a donor and then you \r\nwait. ",
        "Ian: We can't wait. As soon as Arianna's strong enough, we have to do this \r\ntransplant. ",
        "Eve: Someone will turn up. ",
        "Ian: Just like that? ",
        "Eve: No, not \"just like that.\" I have a feeling. ",
        "Ian: You have a feeling? Good, good. Because if we can't find a donor, she's \r\ngoing to die. ",
        "Eve: Hey, I know what's at stake here. You don't have to tell me what's at \r\nstake. ",
        "Joe: All right, all right! There's no point in wasting energy arguing, all \r\nright? We all know what's happening here. ",
        "Ian: Nothing's happening here! That's my point. ",
        "Joe: Look, you're both feeling guilty. You both want her well, and not just \r\nfor the obvious reasons. ",
        "Ian: Don't start, Joseph. ",
        "Joe: Look, you love each other. And if she gets better, you two might finally \r\nhave a chance -- ",

        "Chris: Come on, why don't you just be honest?",

        "Frank: That is not true. ",
        "Karen: Think about it, Frank. Think about how it must feel for me to come to \r\nyou for advice, for a shoulder I need so badly. And there you are, the man \r\nclosest to me in all the world, drunk and blabbering about a talking computer \r\nand time travel? ",
        "Frank: Look, I -- I had a rough night. All right? I wasn't expecting company, \r\nespecially you. I need to let off some steam and get some sleep and I -- I guess \r\nI had a few too many beers. ",
        "Karen: Well, that's all I need to hear. ",

        "Frank: All right, I messed up. You punished me. Now talk. Whatever's going on \r\nhas got you upset. Just tell me. Let me help. What happened? Karen, please. ",

Oh, you do. Well, have fun. Ok, I'll see you around the halls and \r\neverything. Bye. Oh, God. They were right. Even if it wasn't so late, I'll never \r\nfind anybody to take me.
