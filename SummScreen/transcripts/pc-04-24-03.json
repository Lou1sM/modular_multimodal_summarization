A refill.", "Victor: We may have a bottomless coffee cup here, but I'm going to have to charge you for this.", "Frank: Hey, victor, how about some good news? What do you say? I found a buyer for the bar.", "Victor: You what?", "Karen: And it gets better.", "Frank: Yes, it does. The offeisis five times more than what we thought the bar was worth.", "Victor: That's incredible!", "Kevin: Yeah. It also doesn't make any sense.", "Frank: You don't know anything about the deal.", "Kevin: No, but why would anybody pay that much?", "Frank: The guy really wants the place.", "Victor: Your mother's going to be so relieved. No more tapping into the savings to pay the mortgage.", "Frank: See? I told you everything would work out.", "Karen: So, who is this guy, the big spender?", "Frank: He's a developer with lots of plans and a lot of cash.", "Kevin: Nobody pays that kind of money, no matter how much cash they have.", "Frank: You know, you really like to rain on everybody's parade, don't you?", "Victor: Frank, you have any of this in writing --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "kevin: Five times the value? A deal like that has scam written all over it. Come on, frank, what are you up to?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: No, just get away from me! Ow! Ow!", "Joshua: The pangs have started. Oh, dear.", "Livvie: Please --", "joshua: The hunger, the wasting, the feeling tha the body is feeding on its own bone and blood.", "Livvie: Stop it! Stop it!", "Joshua: Oh, dear. I'm so sorry. I don't want you to feel this way. I really don'T. I'd like to take your pain away. Why don't you come to your senses, and I'll take all of this away. I'll give you some fresh, new bld.D.", "Livvie: Please --", "joshua: Then give me the ring.", "Livvie: No! I can't, I can'T.", "Joshua: What a waste. What a pity. Let me know when you change your mind.", "Livvie: Never. I'll never change my mind, not for you, joshua.", "Joshua: Maybe you would for somebody else.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: Alison, let me get this straight. Did you say what I think you said? That you don't want anybody to kill him, after everything he's done to this town?", "Alison: Lucy, that was before.", "Lucy: Oh, my god. What are you -- ian, what are you doing?", "Ian: I'm a doctor.", "Lucy: I know that, but how can you work on him after what he's put you through?", "Ian: Lucy, please.", "Lucy: Fine. I think you guys are all absolutely nuts. What, are you just trying toostpone him from going to hell a little bit sooner? Is that it?", "Alison: Look, lucy, I understand your frustration, but you have to understand, we're not saving a vampire, we're saving a man.", "Ian: Enough talk. You give me a hand and find the keys for this thing.", "Lucy: Rafe --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "rafe: Look, I know how you feel, lucy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: No, you don'T. And I'm not just talking about that. Listen, cousin, I really think I'm losing my powers.", "Rafe: When did this start to happen?", "Lucy: Right after that explosion at the hot spring. And I kn I it's not just this head injury.", "Rafe: Well, you fell into the water, too, remember, before the explosion?", "Lucy: Yeah, I did. Oh, my god, do you think it's the water?", "Rafe: Well, I was afraid it could have that kind of effect, but it did have healing powers. I mean, it healed the vampires.", "Lucy: Wait a minute, so what are you saying? If it heals vampires, that it has the opposite effect on vampire slayers?", "Rafe: Well, yeah. I mean, I was kind of afraid of that. It could drain a slayer's power.", "Lucy: Don't say that. It can't be. I mean, I'm not just thinking about me, but what au ut ian? He counts on me to save him from having to feed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Get me some more water, please.", "Caleb: It must be tough, being around all this blood.", "Ian: You talk too much.", "Caleb: I know the hunger. I know how hard it is not to feed on fresh --", "ian: Well, I'm not you, am I, caleb?", "Caleb: One bite, that's all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: To turn you back to a vampire? Nice try, caleb, but that's not going to work. There's a new wayto freshen small spaces:", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Come on, frank, the truth.", "Frank: I found a buyer for the bar, kevin. What else is there to say? Good things can happen to people, you know?", "Kevin: Not in this town. Not lately. And definitely not to you.", "Victor: I don't know about that. Now, maybe things are starting to turn around for all of us. Frank found a buyer, and I may have just gotten myself another job.", "Kevin: A what?", "Victor: I got a call this morning. Apparently, the port charles building commissioneleleft town rather unexpectedly.", "Karen: And they asked you to take his post? Victor, that's fantastic.", "Victor: Well, I haven't exactly been sofspoken about all the things we could do to improve this town, but I didn't think I could even think about the job, having to be here all the time, especially lately.", "Frank: Well, victor, now you can.", "Kevin: You never held a post like that. Why would they offer it to you?", "Victor: Well, maybe they got tired of my standing up at all those meetings, telling them everything they were doing was wrong. Besides, I've spent a considerable portion of my life in public service --", "kevin: That was decades ago. And since when does being covert C.I.A. Qualify anyone as building commissioner?", "Frank: Kevin, back off.", "Kevin: Aren't you the one who taught me that if something looks too good, it probably is?", "Victor: Well, but --", "kevin: No, no. No offer like that comes without a price.", "Victor: You know, maybe if you spent less time looking so hard for bad news, your life wouldn't look as bleak.", "Kevin: And maybe somebody just found themselves a sucker.", "Karen: Victor, don't let him get to you.", "Victor: I certainly won'T. I -- I'm going to go call your mother. She's going to be so excited.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: All right, good.", "Karen: I've got to say, it does sound a little too good to be true.", "Frank: Hey, we've had more than our share of bad news in this town. Maybe our luck really is changing.", "Karen: Are you sure you don't want me to take a look at that?", "Frk:K: Yeah, it's nothing.", "Karen: Hey, why don't you take advantage of having a doctor as a girlfriend? Besides, I like unbuttoning your shirt.", "Frank: Well, since you put that way, ok.", "Karen: I don't get it.", "Frank: What?", "Karen: Your shoulder, frank -- it's bruised, but where is all the blood coming from?", "Frank: Oh. Like I said, you know, it's nothing. I'm a paramedic and a fast healer. Don't worry about it, ok?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: You pull me away from my patient because you think I can't handle it?", "Rafe: You can't handle it. You can't control your feeding, not anymore. Not if what lucy says is right, not if she's losing her slayer powers.", "Ian: Lucy told you?", "Rafe: Well, she's not su of it yet, but -- what are you doing? Are you trying to cover it up? She's going to figure it out. She's already starting to.", "Ian: Not if I can help it. Not until I figure out what's really going on here.", "Rafe: What's really going -- what are you saying, that there's more to it?", "Ian: I don't know. I'm not sure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: So, tell me, how is our poor wounded former bloodsucker doing?", "Alison: Lucy, please, I don't want to be on opposite sides in this --", "lucy: I know. Ok, you're right. I'm sorry. It's just -- I look at him, and there are so many horrible memories that come with that.", "Alison: Are you still upset becausyoyou couldn't save me?", "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that's part of it. I felt -- listen to me. I am just so glad you're ok.", "Alison: I know. I'm glad, and I'm glad you're ok, too.", "Lucy: Right. I'm not sure how you did it, though. How could you possibly want to even save him?", "Alis:: I don't know. I don't know. It was just -- I think it was something that livvie had said. She said that she wanted to just love him. And when caleb came back to save livvie, he knew he didn't have any more powers to fight joshua, but he still came back to be with her anyway.", "Lucy: Ok, I sort of know something about that.", "Alison: I know. I know you do, and I do, too. And I know you. And if you were there, if you were in that situation, you would have done the exact same thing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Caleb groans]", "Caleb: She needs to know I'm coming back. Olivia --", "livvie's voice: Caleb, come to me. Please.", "Caleb: Olivia.", "Livvie: Caleb? You're here. You came.", "Caleb: I'm still here, olivia. Always.", "Livvie: Caleb, my love.", "Caleb: Always.", "Caleb: Always.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Pipe dreams, all of it. And my father, thinking that he can be --", "joshua: Hello, dr.
