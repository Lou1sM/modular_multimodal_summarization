        "Kevin: Oh, boy. Look at all these messages. ",
        "Lucy: Wow. Hey, let me do those. Let me answer these for you. You know, I can \r\ncall -- no, I'm not going to call them. Better yet, you give me the answer to \r\neach message. I'm going to go face-to-face and personally give them your answer, \r\nok? ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Well, then, I'm going to call on my little cell phone right here \r\nand order flowers for your whole entire office. You know, nothing says \"I'm \r\nsorry for hiring that divorce lawyer when you really weren't ready\" like posies!\r\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, enough. I told you -- I'm not mad anymore. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Oh, here, here, here. Let me do that for you. Voila. Here you go.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Oh! ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Uh-oh. ",
        "Kevin: Whew. Now I'm mad. ",
        "",
        "Ian: How's it going? ",
        "Chris: Well, her vitals are weak, but they're steady. She's resting. ",
        "Ian: Good. Good. ",
        "Chris: Hey, you know, I wanted to tell you, that was an impressive team \r\neffort the other day when we delivered that baby. It was nice to bring someone \r\ninto this world rather than -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know, it was -- it was good. ",
        "Chris: You look like you need some rest. Why don't you go grab a shower, get \r\na nap? ",
        "Ian: I'm not leaving you, Chris. ",
        "Chris: I understand. But let her get her rest, ok? Yes, and, you know, it's \r\nnot going to be long before the hepatin's done its work and her system can \r\nsupport a liver transplant. We just got to find a donor. ",
        "Ian: Our prayers might have been answered. ",
        "Chris: Did they find a donor? ",
        "Ian: Eve's got a lead. It sounds like a solid one. ",
        "",
        "Karen: I'm sorry I've been so hard to get a hold of. I've just had a lot to \r\nthink about lately. ",
        "Eve: I know, but Arianna's nearly ready for a transplant, and she doesn't \r\nhave much more time, and you're a perfect match. ",
        "Karen: You know what I'm worried about, Eve? If I agree to the donor \r\noperation, I'm going to have to take painkillers. ",
        "Eve: I know, and you are understandably concerned about getting hooked again, \r\nbut, Karen, I know that won't happen. You're a much different person now than \r\nyou were then. ",
        "Karen: Once an addict, always an addict. ",
        "Eve: Please, Karen, you might be Arianna's only chance. ",
        "Karen: I told you, Eve, I can't go back there. I can't risk losing myself and \r\neverything I've fought so hard for. ",
        "Eve: So, are you saying you won't do it, you won't be Arianna's donor? ",
        "Karen: I'm saying I can't. You'll have to find another donor. Eve, are you \r\nstill there? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Yeah. I heard you. ",
        "Karen: I'm so very sorry. Bye. ",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Frank: Karen, look, I know you said you wanted to be alone, but I don't think \r\nyou should be. ",
        "Karen: Well, isn't that my call, Frank? ",
        "Frank: Look, I know you're mad at me and scared, but I'm not going to let \r\nanything come between us, Karen, so talk to me, please, because like it or not, \r\nI'm not going away. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Arianna? Are you all right? ",
        "Eve: Arianna? Arianna who? You must have been having some good dream. But \r\nyou're stuck with me. ",
        "Ian: What are you doing here? ",
        "Eve: Well, do I have to spell it out for you? ",
        "Ian: So I can just reach out and grab you and kiss you? ",
        "Eve: Well, it's definitely encouraged because I'm right here, and I'm all \r\nyours. We're together like it was always meant to be. ",
        "Ian: God, I missed you, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: I'm never leaving you again. Never. ",
        "",
        "Karen: This isn't a good time, Frank. ",
        "Frank: You've been crying, Karen. What's wrong? ",
        "Karen: Nothing. ",
        "Frank: You expect me to believe that? ",
        "Karen: I just told Eve I can't be Arianna's donor. I feel selfish and cruel \r\nand in no mood for company. ",
        "Frank: I am not company, for God's sakes. Talk to me. ",
        "Karen: Will you leave me alone, Frank? ",
        "Frank: Karen? Just give me one minute, all right? Then I'll go. ",
        "Karen: One minute. But all bets are off if you start talking about computers \r\nthat can type their own messages or any of that time-travel craziness. ",
        "Frank: I promise, although I'm not so sure it's crazy. ",
        "Karen: Oh -- ",
        "Frank: Karen? I want to be here for you, like I wasn't last night. If you \r\ncan't be Arianna's donor, you need to let yourself off the hook and stop beating \r\nyourself up. ",
        "Karen: A woman is dying and I'm not lifting a finger to save her. Do you know \r\nthe guilt I feel? ",
        "Frank: Well, all I know is if you're not 100% sure you're making the right \r\ndecision, you shouldn't do this. ",
        "Karen: I can't let someone down. ",
        "Frank: When are you going to stop this, Karen? ",
        "Karen: Stop what? ",
        "Frank: Your whole life has been about taking care of someone else -- your \r\nmom, your patients, your friends. When are you going to finally take care of \r\nyou? ",
        "Karen: It's hard to do that sometimes. I just don't know if I have the \r\nstrength to stay off drugs again. They nearly killed me last time, Frank. ",
        "Frank: You have to believe in your heart you can handle this. It's got to be \r\nyour choice. ",
        "Karen: Well, lately, my choices haven't exactly been the greatest. ",
        "Frank: Mine, neither, which is the other reason I'm here. Look, I really \r\nmessed up last night. ",
        "Karen: Big time. ",
        "Frank: And I know it really shook you up to walk in on me babbling to the \r\ncomputer, beer in hand. It was a stupid, stupid move, and I'm sorry I hurt you. \r\nThat is the last thing in this world I ever want to do. ",
        "Karen: When I realized you were drinking -- I mean, what were you thinking, \r\nFrank? You know how scared I am with my mom starting to drink and what \r\nthat means. ",
        "Frank: I know. I know. But though this is hard for me to admit, something \r\nscared me, too, Karen. ",
        "Karen: You? Mr. Macho? Oh, this should be good. ",
        "Frank: I'm afraid of losing you. I am so afraid of screwing this up. ",
        "Karen: Well, things haven't been exactly the greatest between us. ",
        "Frank: And it's my fault, getting all caught up in these spooky messages, \r\nrunning off to save young girls. ",
        "Karen: Which we don't even know if they exist. ",
        "Frank: So? I am asking you for another chance to get it right, to remind you \r\nwhy we're good together. Just give me another chance, Karen, to be the kind of \r\nman you deserve. ",
        "Karen: You don't have to do that, Frank. ",
        "Frank: No, yes, I do. I do. I am fighting for us, Karen. I want you to feel \r\nsafe and happy again. I never want to walk through that door again and find you \r\ncrying all alone. So give me one more chance to make it right, please. ",

        "Chris: Hey! Eve, I heard the good news. ",
        "Eve: What? What good news? ",
        "Chris: Well, Ian told me that you may have a donor lined up for Arianna. \r\nSounds like you're going to be a hero. ",
        "Eve: I told him that I was working on it. He has no right to talk about this \r\nwith anyone. ",
        "Chris: Take it easy. What's the problem? ",
        "Eve: No, the problem is it didn't pan out. I'm not a hero at all. I'm a total \r\nscrew-up. ",
        "Chris: No, you're not a screw-up, ok? Not at all. You saved Arianna's life a \r\nfew days ago. ",
        "Eve: Right, only to have her wasting away in a hospital bed waiting for a \r\ndonor. ",
        "Chris: Eve, we're all in this together, ok? We all want to find a donor. \r\nSomething will turn up. ",
        "Eve: You know what? Don't say \"something will turn up\" like you lost a set of \r\nkeys or something. ",
        "Chris: Come on. You know what I mean. ",
        "Eve: No, you tell Arianna that, ok? Because she's running out of time. ",
        "Chris: I'm just trying to point out that it's a team effort. You don't have \r\nto bear the weight of this on your own shoulders, ok? ",
        "[Pager beeps] ",
        "Chris: I got to run. But, you, lighten up, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Hi. You look kind of upset. Anything I can do to help maybe? ",
        "Eve: Oh, help? You mean like you're trying to help me out of my marriage by \r\npushing along my divorce? ",
        "Lucy: I said I was sorry for that, one thing. And now I'm sorry I walked over \r\nbecause I just wanted to be nice to you. ",
        "Eve: You know, every time you're nice to me, something in my life explodes.\r\n",
        "Lucy: You are having a really bad day, and so I'm going to adios. ",
        "Eve: In fact, I'm in all this trouble because of you. ",
        "Lucy: What? How do you figure that? ",
        "Eve: Arianna would not be in my life right now if she hadn't hit me with her \r\ncar. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but she was driving. I wasn't driving the car. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but I wouldn't have been on the street had Kevin answered the \r\ndoor, and why didn't he answer the door? Because he was in bed with you! ",
        "Lucy: Excuse me. Could you please keep your voice down? I just wanted to help \r\nyou. Keep your voice down. ",
        "Eve: Ok. As a matter of fact, this whole mess -- this whole mess, like I said \r\nbefore, is all your fault. ",
        "Kevin: Eve! ",
        "Eve: It's all your fault, Lucy! ",
        "Kevin: Eve! Leave Lucy alone. I mean it. Back off! ",
        "",
        "Kevin: What the hell is going on here? ",
        "Lucy: Well, we were just having a little girl-to-girl chat.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I heard. Eve, if this is still about that lawyer, I told you \r\nLucy didn't mean it. ",
        "Eve: Lucy never means it. ",
        "Kevin: All right, what's really going on here? ",
        "Eve: Do you want to know what's going on, Kevin? My life is a disaster! Ok? \r\nIt is so bad, I don't even know where to begin to assess the damage. So \r\nexcuse me if I'm a little bit on edge -- oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm \r\nbeing a bitch, aren't I? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, big-time. But I have been there, done that, and I think I \r\nown that t-shirt. ",
        "Eve: Wow. I'm sorry. Kevin, I'm so sorry. ",
        "Kevin: Forget about it. Is there anything I can do? We can do? ",
        "Eve: Thanks, but, no. I have no one to blame for this situation but myself. I \r\nhave to be the one to fix it. And I think I know how. ",

        "Ian: Where's Eve? Where the hell is Eve? ",
        "Chief: Ian, you must forget Eve now. ",
        "Ian: What are you saying? ",
        "Chief: You know. You've always known. You and Eve must part. Your roads have \r\nseparated. You can't be together. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Now, you're working up the energy to boot me out of here for good or \r\nI'm boring you to death. ",
        "Karen: I've been thinking about what you said -- that it's time I took care \r\nof myself. And you're right. ",
        "Frank: You've got to put yourself first, think about what you want, what you \r\nneed for yourself. ",
        "Karen: And what I need to be happy, yeah. ",
        "Frank: Now, I haven't seen that in a while. ",
        "Karen: What? ",
        "Frank: You, smiling. I know I drive you crazy sometimes. ",
        "Karen: Sometimes? ",

        "Karen: I don't want to fight anymore, Frank. ",
        "Frank: No. It takes too much time away from the good stuff. ",
        "Karen: And we have a lot of good stuff. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: So we should forget about our problems and concentrate on us. ",
        "Frank: I think I can manage that. Mmm. ",
        "Karen: I wish I could freeze this moment. It's perfect. ",
        "Frank: Almost. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: That's right. You'll be fine. Bye-bye. Yes? ",
        "Lucy: Russell. ",
        "Kevin: Excuse me? ",
        "Lucy: Russell Crowe -- that's who you reminded me of when you defended me \r\nagainst Eve. You know, you were just so darn rugged and masculine. ",
        "Kevin: You mean as opposed to how I usually am? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no! I'm -- no. That's not -- you know what I meant. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it was you against Eve. I chose you. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you did. I am so very glad. But I can't help feeling badly for \r\nEve. ",
        "Kevin: I know. I do, too. Somehow it seems like that universe of yours just \r\nthrew a few lives up in the air -- that would be yours, mine, Eve's, Ian's -- \r\njust so the people who should be together could be together. Well, we landed on \r\nour feet. To be honest, I'm not sure about those two. ",
        "Lucy: Neither am I -- I don't know -- but there's hope. You know, I mean, \r\nlook, it worked out for us, so it could work out for them. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I hope so. ",
        "Lucy: Me, too. Listen, I -- I -- I need to make a teeny, just the smallest, \r\ntiniest little confession right here. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I hate it when you do that. ",
        "Lucy: I know, Doc, but it's not like one of those. It's this one. Here it \r\ngoes. Ok. You know how you accused me of wanting to hurry along the divorce \r\nbecause I was a little insecure about Eve? Well, I confess. You were right. I \r\nthink I sort of kind of was. But not anymore, Russell. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I knew you'd see it my way. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, we're meant to be together, Doc. We are so meant to be together. \r\nWe are joined at the heart. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ramsey, I've been looking all over for you. We have to talk about \r\ndonors. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I checked and rechecked the registry, but there haven't \r\nbeen any donors located since we last talked. I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: Then there's one thing left for me to do. I read this report about \r\nsomeone being a liver donor that didn't have the same blood type as the \r\nrecipient. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, it's pretty uncommon, but -- why? What are you getting at?\r\n",
        "Eve: I'm part of the reason Arianna is in the condition she's in. I'm going \r\nto be the one to fix this. ",
        "Chris: You're not serious. ",
        "Eve: Yes, I am! I am going to be tested, and then I am going to be Arianna's \r\ndonor. ",
        "Chris: You can't possibly think this is the answer.",
        "Eve: We don't have any other options at this point! ",
        "Chris: Eve, you're grabbing at straws. It's the longest of long shots that \r\nyou'd be a match. ",
        "Eve: I am going to be tested, and you can't stop me. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, I'm sensing that. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Good. That settles it. Ramsey, I don't know how to make you \r\nunderstand this, but I feel like deep down in my heart, I am the one that is \r\nsupposed to save Arianna. ",
        "Chris: All right, look, I know how badly you want this. But what happened to \r\nthe person that you had lined up, the donor who was a perfect match? ",
        "Eve: They don't want to do it. So it has to be me. It has to be me, \r\nok? So, please, take a sample of my blood. Ramsey? ",
        "Chris: Fine! Fine, I will. Look, I think what you're trying to do is \r\nadmirable. But I still have a question for you. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Chris: What happens if you're not a match? I mean, you're pinning all your \r\nhopes on this and it still may not save Arianna. What happens to you then? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Yeah -- yes. Hello. This is Dr. Thornhart. I need to talk to the chief. \r\nIt's a matter of life and death. ",
