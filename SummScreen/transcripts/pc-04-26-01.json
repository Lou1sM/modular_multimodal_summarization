        "Alison: Voila. Oh! ",
        "Jack: You know, she's really stoked. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: Hey, man, I'm really sorry. I didn't know all that money came from \r\nZach. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, neither of you did, man, so -- ",
        "Jack: So now what? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I sure ain't racing for him. ",
        "Jack: Well, what about Alison? We can't keep watching her 24/7. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we won't have to. Look, I've been thinking about going to the \r\ncops. ",
        "Jack: Wow. I mean, do you really think they're going to help us? I mean, most \r\nof them are dumber than a bag of hammers. ",
        "Garcia: Is that so? ",
        "",
        "Frank: Oh, man. That was -- ",
        "Karen: Yeah, I know. ",
        "Frank: Does that mean you're happy? ",
        "Karen: More than I have been in -- maybe ever. ",
        "Frank: Wow. You can't top that. ",
        "Karen: Frank? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. ",
        "Karen: I haven't told you this. I didn't know how and I didn't know if I even \r\nshould. ",
        "Frank: Well, what, is something wrong? ",
        "Karen: Things couldn't be better. I love you, Frank. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Ok, I'll put a rush on these results. But I keep telling you, it's a \r\nlong shot. ",
        "Eve: If there is even the slightest chance that I could save her -- ",
        "Chris: Yeah, emphasis on \"slightest.\" ",
        "Eve: Just shut up and take my blood, all right? ",
        "Ian: What's going on here? ",
        "Eve: I'm going to be Arianna's donor. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Wait, he wasn't talking about you, Garcia. ",
        "Garcia: Just the whole rest of the PCPD. \"Dumber than a bag of hammers.\" I'll \r\nremember that next time I bust you, bright boy. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Garcia, since you're here, I was kind of wondering maybe -- ",
        "Garcia: I'll take a regular coffee and a doughnut if you've got one. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, sure. Coming right up. ",
        "Jamal: I have this little problem. ",
        "Garcia: It's a nice setup you've got here. Where'd you get the money for all \r\nof this? ",
        "Jack: Not where you're thinking. ",
        "Garcia: Hope not. But I'll be stopping by from time to time, checking for any \r\nhot bikes. Hasta la vista. ",
        "Jamal: Nice going, Jack. You really buttered him up for me. Thank you. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, whatever. But it does prove my point. ",
        "Jamal: What are you talking about? What point? ",
        "Jack: The cops in this town aren't going to listen to you or me, all right? \r\nSo you better have a plan B. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right. ",
        "Alison: Excuse me. Yeah, hi. What's going on here? ",
        "Jamal: What -- what are we doing? ",
        "Alison: You two and all your little hush-hush conversations lately. Don't \r\nthink I didn't notice. ",
        "Jamal: Nothing. Nothing. Just, you know -- we're just working, right, bro?\r\n",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, right, work. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, work. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm going to have to start putting some hidden \r\nmicrophones around this place to find out what's really going on. ",
        "Jamal: Ah, that's just -- you know, that's funny. That's a great idea. You \r\nknow that? That's a great idea. ",
        "Alison: It is. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, Spunky, you do that. You get all the secrets on tape. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Yeah, sweetie, you've been sucking too many exhaust fumes. ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, that's just what I'm going to do. ",
        "Jack: Suck in exhaust fumes? ",
        "Jamal: Nah, nah. Get it all on tape. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Jamal: Zach -- his whole scam, dude. ",
        "Jack: You're talking about wearing a wire. ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, look, do me a favor. Watch Alison. Don't let her \r\nout of your sight. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Jamal: All right? Hey, Spunky, I've got to go, baby. ",
        "Alison: Wait. Where -- ",
        "Jamal: I'll be back. ",
        "Alison: Where are you going? ",
        "Jamal: Oh -- surprise. Hi. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Bye. ",
        "Livvie: Bye. ",
        "Alison: He's off planning some surprise for me. ",
        "Livvie: A surprise, huh? ",
        "Jack: Um, yeah, yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I have got a surprise for you. I have the rest of the day free, \r\nso I thought maybe we could go for a ride down to the river to our spot and you \r\nknow. ",
        "Jack: I can't. ",
        "Livvie: Not even for a little while? ",
        "Jack: Well, I've got some stuff to work on this bike, and I really need to \r\nget it done. ",
        "Alison: There's no rush. You guys go. Have a good time. ",
        "Livvie: Come on! So what are you waiting for? Let's go. ",
        "Jack: Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I really have to stay here. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, what's going on? ",
        "Jack: I told you. I just have work to do, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, like -- like last night and now, today. Did something happen?\r\n",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Livvie: To make you not want to be with me anymore. ",
        "",
        "Frank: This is too unreal. ",
        "Karen: What, that I love you? ",
        "Frank: Yeah. No -- I mean, after the way I messed up. ",
        "Karen: Oh, you mean, you make mistakes? You're not perfect? And all these \r\nyears I thought you were. Well, all bets are off, then. ",
        "Frank: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. I may not be perfect, but I am \r\nwilling to learn. ",
        "Karen: Oh, you think you can? ",
        "Frank: It may take a while, but I'm not going anywhere. ",
        "Karen: I wish I didn't have to, but I got to go. ",
        "Frank: Whoa -- now? ",
        "Karen: I wouldn't if it weren't important. ",
        "Frank: More important than this? ",
        "Karen: I have to call Eve. I've decided to be Arianna's donor. ",
        "Frank: Whoa. But I thought you -- ",
        "Karen: Yeah, yeah, I know. I said I wouldn't, and I'm still a little scared, \r\nwhat it'll do getting drugs back into my system. ",
        "Frank: Karen, I told you you didn't have to do this. ",
        "Karen: But I can. You made me realize that. Being here with you, and knowing \r\nwe're together -- I can fight anything. I guess I have something to fight for.\r\n",
        "Frank: There's no guarantee it'll be easy. ",
        "Karen: Easier than what Arianna's facing. I can save her life. ",
        "Frank: You are so amazing, willing to take this risk for her. ",
        "Karen: Well, not just for her. For Eve and Ian, too. Ian told Eve that he \r\ndidn't just want her for one night but for always. That kind of love is rare. I \r\nknow. ",
        "Karen: Thank you. ",
        "Frank: For what? ",
        "Karen: You saw the darkest side of me last night, and you're still here. ",
        "Frank: Hey, I was no treat, either. ",
        "Karen: I'll make a deal with you. Don't remind me of how selfish I was, and I \r\nwon't tell anybody about your drunken rantings last night. ",
        "Frank: I may have been a little tainted last night, Karen, but I didn't \r\nimagine what happened. The computer told me I was the only friend Cookie has.\r\n",
        "Karen: You still think she's living in 1973. ",
        "Frank: It's true, Karen. ",
        "Karen: Oh, come on, Frank. ",
        "Frank: I have been talking to 1973 and I have proof. ",

        "Girl: Cookie? Hi, it's Barb. ",
        "Cookie: Hi, Barb. What do you want? ",
        "Barb: To say I was sorry I won't see you at the dance. I know that guy you \r\nwanted to take is going with somebody else. ",
        "Cookie: How do you know who I wanted to take? ",
        "Barb: Please. You drool over him every time he walks by. It's a good thing he \r\nnever notices you, or he'd see what a fool you're making out of yourself. Still \r\nthere, Cookie? ",

        "Cookie: I'll show them. All of them. ",

        "Ian: You're going to be Arianna's donor? ",
        "Chris: Checking to see if she's a match. ",
        "Ian: What the hell is the matter with you? Do you know how unlikely that is?\r\n",
        "Eve: I asked him to do it. Let me know as soon as you get the results, ok? \r\nThank you. ",
        "Ian: So this was your idea? ",
        "Eve: Arianna will die soon if we don't find a donor for her. ",
        "Ian: You're not even the same blood type. ",
        "Eve: I am O, the universal donor, and Arianna and I are both negative. And if \r\nwe find enough antigens that match, it could work. ",
        "Ian: You're grasping at straws here. ",
        "Eve: It's better than nothing. ",
        "Ian: Why? ",
        "Eve: Why what? ",
        "Ian: Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to yourself? ",
        "Eve: Because I am part of the reason she's here. I should be the one to save \r\nher. ",
        "Ian: If it were that simple, you don't think I would have done that already?\r\n",
        "Eve: Why are you angry with me? You should be thanking me. ",
        "Ian: Eve. ",
        "Eve: Let go. Let go of me. Let go! Let go! ",
        "",
        "Karen: What are you talking about? What proof? ",
        "Frank: A note from Cookie. ",
        "Karen: Written in 1973? ",
        "Frank: I know it sounds out there. ",
        "Karen: Sounds? ",
        "Frank: But I asked Cookie to leave me a note at Kelly's, and I found it \r\nexactly where I told her to put it, and the thing looked like it had been there \r\nfor 28 years. ",
        "Karen: What, did you have it carbon-dated or something? ",
        "Frank: There's more. You know how I told you I saw her name carved in the \r\nwindowsill at Kelly's? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. ",
        "Frank: Well, I had Victor bring some equipment to test how old the carving \r\nwas. He said between 25 and 30 years. ",
        "Karen: Ok, if this was true -- ",
        "Frank: Are you saying you do believe me? ",
        "Karen: I am saying if it was, by some miracle, possible to talk to somebody \r\nin the past, shouldn't she be afraid of saying something or doing something that \r\ncould change all that? You know, alter what comes next? ",
        "Frank: No, I hadn't really thought of that. ",
        "Karen: You should be careful, Frank. You could be going somewhere that you \r\nshouldn't. ",
        "Frank: Or I could be keeping Cookie from making a very big mistake. ",
        "Karen: If it was true, which I still don't believe. ",
        "Frank: Look, I tell you what. You call Eve, set up your appointment for being \r\nArianna's donor, and I'll pick you up. We'll go to Kelly's together. I'll show \r\nyou the note. I'll show you the carving. And if you still don't believe me, then \r\nyou can have me committed. ",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm. Well, the only commitment I want is from you to me. ",
        "Frank: Hmm. You have got that. ",
        "Karen: I've got to get moving. ",
        "Frank: I don't want to let you go. ",
        "Karen: Oh, it's only for a little while. Now get out of here. ",

        "Ian: You're not the one that left her alone. You've nothing to feel guilty \r\nfor. ",
        "Eve: This isn't about guilt. ",
        "Ian: Then, what? ",
        "Eve: Destiny. Our destiny. And I can't help but feel that Arianna is a part \r\nof that. And I think that I was meant to be the one to save her. So if you don't \r\nwant to do anything about it, fine. You can give up, but not me. I know that I'm \r\na match for Arianna no matter what you or anybody else says. ",
