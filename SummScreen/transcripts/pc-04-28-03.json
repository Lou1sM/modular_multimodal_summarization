        "After assuring Joshua that everything is under control, Frank drives Victor to his new job as building commissioner. Determined to decode the list of potential vampire recruits, Rafe breaks into Joshua's secret room and logs into his computer. After spitting out the painkiller provided by Ian, Caleb tries desperately to persuade Alison to let him get to Olivia. Starving from blood hunger, Livvie hallucinates that Caleb comes to her. Alison finally asks Caleb whether he killed her father, and Caleb informs her that he didn't. He simply heard about Malcolm's disappearance and decided to use it to his advantage. Taken in by Joshua's charms, Mary and Karen decide to include the bar's new owner in their celebratory party. Caleb doesn't understand how Alison can keep him away from the woman he loves so deeply. Alison changes the dressing on Caleb's wound after his thrashing around causes a great deal of bleeding. Caleb accuses Alison of helping Joshua destroy him and Olivia. He urges her to listen to her heart and do what it tells her. Frank bites his shocked stepfather. When a startling personal message appears on the computer screen, Rafe flees the secret room just before it blows up."

        "Joshua: You're completely?",
        "Frank: 100%, Joshua. Trust me, he doesn't suspect a thing.",
        "Joshua: You know Victor Collins that well?",
        "Frank: Absolutely. We're very close don't worry.",
        "Joshua: Alright I shall leave all the fretting to you, Frank, but don't disappoint me. I've never handled disappointment well. So, everything's working out perfectly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mary: Victor, will you hold still, please?",
        "Victor: You really like this?",
        "Mary: Oh, I love it. Didn't you say it was your lucky tie?",
        "Victor: Well, it is, but that's why I brought both of them here for you to see. I thought maybe something more conservative --",
        "Mary: Darling, I think this is wonderful. And I think you're wonderful. And I think everything's going to go wonderfully for you. I mean, you have been approved as the city's new building commissioner. It's just going to be terrific. I'm so excited for you. You are my big hotshot.",
        "Frank: Hey, guys.",
        "Mary: Frank.",
        "Victor: Hi.",
        "Mary: What are you doing here?",
        "Frank: Well, I just came by to tell you I love you and say congrats to you on your big day.",
        "Victor: Let's not push it. I haven't done anything yet.",
        "Frank: Oh, you are perfect for it. And you know what? It's time for you to get used to a limousine life.",
        "Victor: I beg your pardon?",
        "Frank: Well, in honor of your exalted position-to-be, I came by to drive you downtown, Victor.",
        "Mary: Well, that is so thoughtful of you, Frank. Isn't that sweet of him?",
        "Victor: Well, yes, Frank, but I prefer to drive myself. I -- it relaxes me.",
        "Frank: Oh, not half as much as sitting back and letting somebody else fight the traffic.",
        "Victor: Frank, I really appreciate your offer --",
        "frank: Then that settles it.",
        "Victor: Look --",
        "Frank: I insist!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I'm so hungry. So -- ow. Stop him, please.",
        "Joshua's voice: The love of your life saved his own skin and didn't think about yours. So now it's just you and me.",
        "Livvie: He'll come back for me. You'll see. Caleb will come back.",
        "Joshua: Perhaps. But at that point, you'll already have starved to death.",
        "Livvie: Caleb, where are you? Please come back to me. Help me, please. Help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know I have problems with Livvie and you do, too, but leaving her with this monster -- it's not right.",
        "Rafe: It's ok, I'm working on something, all right?",
        "Alison: What are you working on?",
        "Rafe: A way to get Livvie out. Meanwhile, as long as she's got Caleb's ring, Joshua can't lay a finger on her, so that gives me more time.",
        "Alison: More time for what? And what is this?",
        "Rafe: Oh, it's a list that Ian found at Joshua's place. See, it's all sort of in code, but Frank's name was at the top of it. Then frank was turned.",
        "Alison: So then maybe it's a list --",
        "Rafe: Of Joshua's possible targets, but we just don't know who or why or --",
        "Alison: Well, I think we should really find out or do our best job to do that.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. No, definitely. I mean, the sooner we find out, the closer we will be to stopping Joshua. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Ok, perfect. While you're out doing that, I will keep an eye on Caleb, ok?",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, you know, there shouldn't be much to keep an eye on. I mean, he should be out cold most of the night. We gave him a pretty strong pain medication. If he even blinks, you call me, ok?",
        "Alison: I know. I promise, if anything happens, I will call you. But I want you to be careful, ok?",
        "Rafe: Ok. I promise.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Be careful, too.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: You insist?",
        "Frank: I know, bad choice of words. I guess I just don't know how else to say I'm sorry, Victor, for being a flake these past few weeks, and I'm hoping you'll take this as an apology.",
        "Mary: Oh, don't be so hard on yourself, Frank. Of course he will. After all, you're the one that found the buyer for this place, which leaves you free to do all the things you wanted to do, right?",
        "Victor: You certainly came through for us when it counted, Frank.",
        "Mary: It's a great opportunity.",
        "Frank: So, what do you say to my offer, your honor?",
        "Victor: Wish me luck.",
        "Mary: Oh, good luck, sweetheart. Oh, yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb, you're supposed to be sleeping. Did the medication not work? Are you in any pain?",
        "Caleb: Yes.",
        "Alison: Is there anything that I can do for you?",
        "Caleb: Let me go.",
        "Alison: I can't let you go anywhere",
        "Caleb: I'm powerless, Alison. What could I possibly do?",
        "Alison: Well, just because you look harmless doesn't mean that you are.",
        "Caleb: You think I would hurt you? I get it. He told you not to talk to me. That's too bad. Bet there's a lot of questions you'd like to ask.",
        "Alison: Actually, there is one that I've always wanted to ask you. Did you kill my father?",
        "Caleb: No. He disappeared on his yacht. At least that's what I heard. I saw an opportunity, and I took advantage.",
        "Alison: I see. So -- so you just played with our lives because you could? You made Rafe and I believe that we were brother and sister and you ruined my wedding because it was convenient for you.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, you and everyone else around here -- you did everything you could to destroy me. So maybe I just wanted you and Rafe to feel a little bit of the same pain that I felt.",
        "Alison: But in the end, it was Livvie who was the one who destroyed you.",
        "Caleb: That was my fault. I took her heart because I didn't trust her to be who she was. For that, I'll never forgive myself.",
        "Alison: You really do love her, don't you? It's so amazing to me how someone can be so cruel sometimes but yet love so deeply like that.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, you know what I don't understand? How someone who believes they love so deeply can be so intent on keeping me from the one I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: I heard about Victor being the new city building commissioner. That's great. You must be so proud.",
        "Mary: Oh, bursting. And I'm thrilled about Frank, too.",
        "Livvie: I am, too. And you are right. He does seem better.",
        "Mary: Hmm. So, I thought since we have two reasons to celebrate and, you know, people are now speaking to each other, it might be fun to have a party.",
        "Karen: To celebrate Victor's new job. What a great idea.",
        "Mary: Oh, I was hoping you'd feel that way. Now, I know we have to work really fast, so let's get started phoning --",
        "Karen: Yeah.",
        "Mary: And get going here.",
        "Joshua: What good fortune for me -- two beautiful ladies. Good evening.",
        "Mary: Well, good evening.",
        "Joshua: I hope I'm not interrupting, but I just thought I'd come by and check up on my newest acquisition. I'm Joshua Temple. I'm the new owner of this place.",
        "Mary: Oh, hi. It's so nice to meet you. Well, I'm Mary Collins.",
        "Joshua: Mrs. Collins. Mary? How nice to meet you. And --",
        "Mary: And this is Dr. Wexler.",
        "Joshua: \"Doctor\"? What an unusual first name.",
        "Karen: I'm karen.",
        "Josh: Oh, very nice to meet you. Well, if you don't mind, I think, perhaps, we may raise a glass and toast my closing deal. Does that appeal to you?",
        "Mary: Well, you know, we were just starting to plan a small party. Why don't we combine the two occasions and celebrate them together?",
        "Joshua: Excellent idea.",
        "Mary: Oh, my gosh. Well, let's make a toast. Here. There you go. Maybe you could pour. Oh, and here. Here you go, Karen.",
        "Karen: Thank you.",
        "Joshua: Well, we know what I'm celebrating. It seems to me like you two ladies are celebrating something also.",
        "Mary: As we speak, my husband is closing a deal that will utterly change his life.",
        "Joshua: Well, congratulations. That's very good. Good for him. I'm sure for you, too. Well, here's to your husband and new opportunities.",
        "Mary: To Victor.",
        "Karen: Victor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: I'm beginning to be afraid I may be a tad overdressed.",
        "Frank: No, Victor, listen, for the 17th time, you look great. Relax. You were made for this job. Ok?",
        "Victor: I hope so.",
        "Frank: All right. Go get them, tiger.",
        "Councilman Haden: Yes?",
        "Victor: Councilman Haden.",
        "Councilman Haden: Please, Mr. Collins, come in.",
        "Victor: Thank you.",
        "Councilman Haden: You're right on time. I can't even begin to tell you how much I've been looking forward to this meeting.",
        "Victor: Really?",
        "Councilman Haden: With a passion.",
        "Frank: Yeah, victor, we've all been looking forward to this meeting with a passion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok. Practice makes perfect. Let's see -- you got any new toys around here this week, Joshua? Everything pretty much looks the same. So far, so good. Let's see. Now, if I remember correctly -- oh, damn. There we go.",
        "[Computer beeps]",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "[Computer beeps]",
        "Rafe: All right. Now let's see if I can bring up that little list of yours.",
        "[Computer beeps]",
        "Rafe: Ok. Here it is. Now, I think I might be able to decode this. Ok. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that? What's that? Here we go. Just a few minutes, and I'm going to know every name on this list. You watch out when I do because I'm going to get to them before you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You say you and Rafe share this great love, but you don't see that in Livvie and I.",
        "Alison: That's because it's not the same thing.",
        "Caleb: Or you just can't admit it because if you did, you couldn't keep me like this, you couldn't keep me locked up like some kind of animal.",
        "Alison: Ok, well, I can't let you go. Ok? I can't.",
        "Caleb: It's hard to look at me when I'm telling the truth, isn't it?",
        "Alison: You know, I don't have to take this anymore.",
        "Caleb: Don't do this to me! Don't do this to me! Don't leave me like this!",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just -- please, you need to just relax a little bit.",
        "Caleb: No!",
        "Alison: Caleb, please. You're going to hurt yourself.",
        "Caleb: Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. I don't care. I don't care. I'll kill myself to be with her. I'll kill myself if I can't be with her!",
        "Alison: Please, stop it! Stop that.",
        "Caleb: Don't you understand? Olivia!",
        "Alison: Please, you're losing a lot of blood, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: Leave me.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Caleb: Leave me to die --",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Caleb: If you will not let me go to her.",
        "Alison: Just relax. Relax. If you just sit still, it will heal --",
        "Caleb: Ok look at me. Listen to me, Alison. Look at me! Look at me! Olivia needs me, and I need her.",
        "Alison: Please don't do this to me.",
        "Caleb: We are not -- we are not whole if we're not together. We hunger for each other. And I know you know how that feels. So please don't do this to us. Please. I am begging you, Alison. Don't keep us apart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I believe in you, Caleb. You're already on your way back to me. You won't abandon me. You won't. Ok, just relax, Livvie. \"Breathe deep.\" That's what he'd say. \"You'll be fine before you know it. And I'll be right there.\" I can feel you closer already as your cool fingers gently --",
        "Caleb: Gently sweep the hair back from your eyes. And when you look up, I'll be there. And deep in my eyes, you'll find all the strength you need because you'll know my love is with you and you'll know that I'm never going to leave you again. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Ok, Joshua, mission accomplished.",
        "Joshua: There you are.",

        "Mary: Oh, no. No, no, no. That's enough, thanks.",
        "Joshua: One's never enough, Mary.",
        "Karen: Is that me?",
        "[Ring]",
        "Joshua: You know, I think that is probably me. Oh, yes, it is. Karen, please, will you do the honors? Don't you refuse, my lady. I'll be very upset.",
        "Mary: Oh. He's quite a flatterer.",
        "Karen: Isn't he?",
        "Mary: Hate it.",
        "Karen: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Joshua: Speak.",
        "Frank: It's me. The job's done.",
        "Joshua: Very good. I'll be in touch. Now, what have I been missing?",
        "Karen: Well, we missed you.",
        "Joshua: You know, I could get us to this. My whole day's been full of good fortune. A toast to good fortune.",
        "Mary: Good fortune.",
        "Karen: To our good fortune.",
        "Mary: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: You're a lucky man, Victor, believe me. When you wake up, you'll thank me for this.",
        "Livvie: I was so afraid. I was afraid that something went wrong and you weren't going to come back, you weren't going to come back for me, not in time. Oh.",
        "Caleb: Hey. Hey. Look at me. You're the one that would always say we have nothing to worry about, there's nothing to be afraid of as long as we're together. I am with you always. Always.",
        "Livvie: Always. I remember that. Always. I can feel you. I shiver when your -- ow!",
        "Caleb: You are never alone.",
        "Livvie: I can feel your cool hands as they -- ow!",
        "Caleb's voice: Keep on believing with all your heart, all your soul.",
        "Livvie: I do.",
        "Caleb's voice: Believe in me, Olivia, in us, and I'll be there.",
        "Livvie: No. No, Caleb, please, don't leave me. Please don't leave me.",
        "Caleb's voice: Never.",
        "Livvie: Please. Please, Caleb.",
        "Caleb's voice: You'll be all right.",
        "Livvie: Hurry. Oh, hurry. I don't think I can make it. I don't think I can hold on any longer. Please. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: She needs me. I feel it.",
        "Alison: Save your strength, ok? Joshua can't hurt her. She's got your ring.",
        "Caleb: The ring won't stop him from causing her pain. He'll starve her to death. You're helping him destroy her, destroy us.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not. That's not true.",
        "Caleb: I opened up to you, Alison. I answered all your questions. It was just a test, wasn't it? Just a test to see if the monster had any feelings.",
        "Alison: No, that's not true. I know that you have feelings. When Rafe gets back, I promise --",
        "Caleb: Rafe isn't here. And we can't wait. This can't wait. Please. Alison, what does your heart tell you? Trust yourself, and you'll know what you have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: All right, all right. Just a few seconds more, and the code will be broken. Once I finally know Joshua's victim-to-be list, I will have the advantage that can finally bust that son of a --",
