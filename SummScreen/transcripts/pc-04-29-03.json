        "Desperate to find out what is poisoning Lucy, Ian asks Chris to run the lab tests a third time. Lucy forces Ian to admit that making love with her no longer helps curb his appetite for blood. Ian then informs her that some type of toxin is depleting her red blood cells. He promises to figure it out. A personal message to Rafe on Joshua's computer screen prompts the slayer to flee the secret room just as it blows up. Joshua has Livvie taken to the patio, where he again tries to persuade her to give him the ring. Livvie falls into her father's arms for protection, but Kevin is even less himself than ever. A trail of blood leads out the door where Rafe apparently dragged himself out of Joshua's hideout. Just as Caleb finally persuades Alison to let him go, Elizabeth shows up at the apartment. Elizabeth sees Caleb's predicament and tells him off for mistreating her at the hospital. In turn, Caleb tells Elizabeth what he thinks of her incessant whining about herself after everything Alison has been through. He and Alison are stunned to hear about the discovery of wedding bands in Joshua's hideout. Alison pushes her mother out the door and sets Caleb free. Under Joshua's influence, Kevin tricks Livvie and breaks the chain that hangs around her neck. Kevin gives Joshua the ring and then returns to his painting. The ring on his finger, Joshua offers Livvie a glass of red liquid so that she doesn't have to starve."

        "Ian: Ramsey, slow down. I understand you ran them twice. You didn't come up with anything. What I'm asking is to run them one more time. Tell me what those toxins are. Please. Call me if you find out anything.",
        "Lucy: Hi.",
        "Ian: Hi. I forgot your chocolate. Did you get some rest?",
        "Lucy: No, I couldn't. I had too much on my mind.",
        "Ian: I don't want you to do any more thinking. I just want you to take it easy.",
        "Lucy: See, that's not right. That's not how it works. You take care of me, I get to take care of you, too.",
        "Ian: I'm fine.",
        "Lucy: Not good enough. I -- I don't want you just fine. I want you more than fine. I want you to be able to go back to your old self.",
        "Ian: Hey, hey, hey, hey. You don't need to do that.",
        "Lucy: I want to do that. You need me, and I need you. Please make love to me.",

        "Rafe: All right, all right. Just a few seconds more and the code'll be broken. And once I finally know Joshua's victim-to-be list, I will have the advantage that can finally bust that son of a --",

        "Caleb: I know you want to do the right thing, Alison. Help me save Olivia.",
        "Alison: Rafe will be back soon.",
        "Caleb: Joshua's starving her. Do you have any idea what that would be like?",
        "Alison: He said that he's working on a plan to get her out.",
        "Caleb: He's trying to get to Joshua first to save the woman he loves. Help me do the same thing.",
        "Alison: I keep telling you, I can't do that.",
        "Caleb: We both know you could -- if you thought Olivia was worth saving.",
        "Alison: No, this is not about my feelings about Livvie. I would never want anything to happen to her.",
        "Caleb: I know you still care about her, Alison. She was your best friend.",
        "Alison: That was a long time ago.",
        "Caleb: Whatever she's did to you, it's my fault. I took away the person you knew. But I'm also trying to bring her back.",
        "Alison: This isn't about Livvie.",
        "Caleb: It's all about her.",
        "Alison: If I let you go, there's a chance that she could turn you back into a vampire.",
        "Caleb: And if you don't, you're going to have to live with what happens to her.",
        "Alison: She's protected by the ring.",
        "Caleb: No. You have no idea of the things Joshua could do to her, even wearing the ring. Please.",
        "Caleb: Please.",

        "Livvie: No -- where are you taking me?",
        "Man: Just follow orders.",
        "Livvie: I thought he was dragging me to a torture chamber.",
        "Joshua: Why bother? Aren't the hunger pangs bad enough?",
        "Livvie: Why did you bring me here?",
        "Joshua: You've been in your cell for so long. I thought perhaps you would like some fresh air. Besides, the gardens are so beautiful. This is such a lovely evening.",
        "Livvie: Oh. I will never give you this ring.",
        "Joshua: It doesn't have to be this hard, Livvie. Look at you. You can't enjoy any of this beauty because you're literally starving.",
        "Livvie: I'd rather die than give you what you want.",
        "Joshua: So much pain. So dramatic.",
        "[Livvie groans]",
        "Joshua: You can make this easier for yourself.",
        "Livvie: If I give you the ring, you'll still kill me.",
        "Joshua: No. I wouldn't kill you. I give you my word as a gentleman.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, a gentleman.",
        "Joshua: Under most circumstances, but you have been very uncooperative. Don't you understand? I cannot be stopped. But you -- you could stop all of this agony. Just give me the ring. And then you'll be free.",

        "Caleb: Don't.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh.",
        "Alison: Mother, hi.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, my gosh. Oh. Lucy called me and told me that you were safe. I just -- oh, I have been so, so worried about you. You have no idea.",
        "Alison: I'm sure that must have been so scary for you.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Alison, I haven't slept. I haven't eaten anything. All I wanted to do was see you again, and now that I do -- oh, it's just been worth the wait. I'm so glad you're all right.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I am -- I am fine, I really am. You know, with everything that's been going on lately, I just -- it's been so crazy. I've made a pact with myself, though. I've decided I'm going to take better care of myself and I'm going to get more rest. And I'm really just going to kind of take more time for myself, so if you don't mind --",
        "Elizabeth: We're going to start right now. I'm going to make you some soup.",
        "Alison: Wait, no, mother I think that you should -- mother --",
        "Elizabeth: Well, well, well. There is a God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Caleb told me to keep this ring.",
        "Joshua: Do you always do what he tells you to?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, no matter what.",
        "Joshua: Such devotion. I wonder where your devoted Caleb is right now in your time of need.",
        "Livvie: He'll come for me.",
        "Joshua: Will he? Like prince charming? Shall we watch for him? Maybe he'll gallop up on a big white steed.",
        "Livvie: He'll come for me. And when he does, he'll kill you for what you've done to me.",
        "Joshua: Maybe he can't come for you. Maybe he's dead. He's only a man after all.",
        "Livvie: He's not dead.",
        "Joshua: Then maybe he's mortally wounded. Maybe he's lying, dying someplace, calling out for you, \"Olivia, Olivia\" that's more likely. You can go find him yourself now. Why don't you go find the man you love? You can be free. Just give me the ring.",
        "Livvie: You'd never let me go to him.",
        "Joshua: What do I have to do to get you to trust me? Perhaps another goodwill gesture?",
        "Livvie: I would -- I would rather be in my cell than be here with you.",
        "Joshua: Aren't you even just a little curious to e what I have to offer?",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Joshua: I think you will be once you see him.",
        "Livvie: Daddy.",

        "Ian: Uh -- I got to tell you something.",
        "Lucy: It's true, isn't it? It's true. It doesn't work anymore. I don't help you, do I?",
        "Ian: You help me every day just by being who you are.",
        "Lucy: No, I mean, I don't help you, your symptoms. I'm not helping you. And don't lie. I found this.",
        "Ian: God, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Why did you do it? Why did you keep pretending that it was working? Why didn't you just tell me? Why did you pretend that making love with me helped?",
        "Ian: Because I didn't know how to tell you.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Look, I know you hate this. I hate living like this, too. I hate it for you. But you can't not be honest with me. If you do, then we can't get through this. You have to. Unless you're honest --",
        "Ian: I know, I know, I know. And I'm sorry, because I love you very much. But I don't want you to worry about me.",
        "Lucy: But that's like asking me not to breathe.",
        "Ian: Lucy, come here.",
        "Lucy: No, I -- I can't do that right now. I need to be strong. And I need you to understand that I'm fighting this. I'm going to get my slayer powers back. If I have to train, whatever, study, I will do it. I can -- do this. What is it? Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Ian: It's not just your slayer power, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: What do you -- what do you mean?",
        "Ian: I ran some more tests.",
        "Lucy: Ok. What did they tell you? I mean, is -- something is wrong with me?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Well, imagine this -- you used me to help you escape and here you end up captured after all. What a pity.",
        "Caleb: Not now, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: What? Why? Am I inconveniencing you? Is there somewhere that you have to be?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. I do.",
        "Elizabeth: Really? Because it looks like you have so much to do. Hmm. Where's a helicopter when you need one?",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry about what happened at the hospital.",
        "Elizabeth: What -- what happened at the hospital? God, you make it sound like it was some kind of an accident. You made me believe that you wanted me again, that we were actually going to have a life together.",
        "Alison: Mother --",
        "Elizabeth: Every word out of your mouth was a lie. I helped you. I did everything that you asked me to do and you just left me there. Do you have any idea how badly that felt, how stupid I felt?",
        "Alison: Mother, please, this really isn't the best time --",
        "Elizabeth: No, Alison, I really need to talk to him for a minute.",
        "Caleb: Everything's always about you, isn't it? Do you have any idea what Alison's been through?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, of course --",
        "Caleb: She was held in a cell, she barely got out with her own life, and all you can talk about is your feelings.",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no. Come on, that's not true.",
        "Caleb: And all this was after Joshua dressed her up and forced her to spend time with him. Maybe if you try real hard for one moment, you might be able to imagine what that would be like.",
        "Elizabeth: What? What -- what happened?",
        "Caleb: Oh, like you give a damn.",
        "Elizabeth: How dare you insinuate that I don't love my daughter. I offered to sacrifice myself for her!",
        "Caleb: Right.",
        "Elizabeth: I did. When we were in Joshua's and I found those wedding bands, I offered myself when I thought that he was going to force you to marry him.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Oh, daddy. Thank God you're here.",
        "Kevin: Are you all right?",
        "Livvie: No, you have to help me.",
        "Kevin: You look very well under the circumstances.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Kevin: Everythi'ngs going to be just fine, honey.",
        "Livvie: No, daddy, he's starving me. He's keeping me prisoner here.",
        "Kevin: No, everything's going to be ok, I promise. I can see everything laid out right in front of me.",
        "Livvie: What have you done to him?",
        "Joshua: What have I done for him?",
        "Livvie: No, tell me!",
        "Joshua: I've given him something to make him more cooperative.",
        "Kevin: Livvie, you have to see it. Joshua's enabled me to create the most amazing piece of art. It's incredible.",
        "Livvie: No, daddy, please. You have to listen to me.",
        "Kevin: This is the first break I've taken in hours. I've never wanted to create something so strongly in my life.",
        "Livvie: You bastard! I will kill you for what you've done to him.",
        "Kevin: Honey, honey. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Kevin: Shh.",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Kevin: Shh-shh-shh-shh.",
        "Livvie: Daddy, no.",
        "Kevin: I promise you.",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Kevin: Now, just listen to me.",

        "Lucy: I am not sick.",
        "Ian: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: I'm not. Come on, I mean, I'm losing my slayer powers, and that's very confusing to me, but I think that's understandable under the circumstances, don't you?",
        "Ian: What I'm trying to --",
        "Lucy: I went to the hospital with you. You made me take all those God forsaken tests, remember? And you just said I was anemic and I need vitamins, so I'm taking those. And I'm trying to rest, but I can't rest because --",
        "Ian: Shh. The tests didn't show anything, because whatever this is wasn't absorbed into your bloodstream yet.",
        "Lucy: What does that mean?",
        "Ian: There is some kind of toxin in your system.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Ian: And we're trying to figure out where it came from. It might've been the hot spring.",
        "Lucy: I have a toxin? What is it doing to me?",
        "Ian: It's depleting your red blood cells.",
        "Lucy: I see. But you -- you can fix it, right? I mean, I know you -- you can make me better. You can fix me, right, Ian? You can fix it?",
        "Ian: You know me, right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I know you. You can fix me. You can make it better. I know that. So what you're really saying, right, is just that it's kind of, what, a matter of time? Like --",
        "Ian: Just a matter of time. We'll get it, though. We'll fix this. This is not a problem. Absolutely.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, then. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: What, Lucy didn't tell you about the rings?",
        "Alison: No. No, she probably told Rafe, but he probably didn't want to worry me.",
        "Elizabeth: Sweetie, I was scared to death.",
        "Caleb: Hey, how do you know the ring was for Alison?",
        "Elizabeth: A mother just knows. I offered myself for you because I didn't want anything bad to happen to you, babe.",
        "Alison: Oh, God. That's probably what the gown was for. He wants to marry me.",
        "Caleb: You or Olivia.",
        "Alison: Oh, God. Mother, listen to me. You have to go.",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, I'm not -- no, I'm not going anywhere. What --",
        "Alison: Listen, please, please, just trust me.",
        "Caleb: Get out!",
        "Alison: Listen to me. I promise you I'll tell you everything later. Trust me.",
        "Elizabeth: No, just what is going on?",
        "Alison: Trust me, please.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I offered my life -- my life -- for yours.",
        "Alison: Ok --",
        "Elizabeth: If that isn't enough, then what is?",
        "Alison: I promise I'll -- I'll tell you later. Oh, God.",

        "Alison: Oh, God.",

        "Alison: What do I do?",
        "Caleb: Listen, you have no idea what Joshua's doing to her. Alison, please.",
        "Alison: Ok. Ok.",
        "Caleb: That's it. Right here. Do it, Alison. Get this one.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
