        "Lucy promises to go to the hospital for more tests after the party for Victor. Frank assures a confused Victor that he's been given an amazing gift. After Livvie drinks up, Joshua whispers something into her ear, and the shock of what she hears causes her to drop the glass. Livvie tries to kill Joshua, but the ring protects him from her.",
        "At the party, Victor's energy really surprises Mary. After learning that Ricky plans to go ahead with the VH1 special, Casey and Jamal warn the musician not to anger Joshua. When Karen suggests that she and Frank buy a house together, Frank is agreeable until he learns that it's on the riverside. While Victor juggles three oranges, Chris and Elizabeth dance. Casey rejects Ricky when he puts the moves on her. Jamal advises an insecure Casey to trust her instincts. Seeing Frank, Lucy and Ian start to leave but stop when Joshua walks in. Ian and Lucy are stunned when Mary introduces Joshua as the pub's new owner.",
        "Alison refuses to let Caleb return to the villa alone. Caleb warns that if faced with a choice, he will save Olivia's life over hers. Alison insists on going with him anyway. At the villa, Rafe startles Caleb by pointing a stake at him. Alison puts a halt to the ensuing argument between the two men. Inside the villa, Caleb and Olivia reunite. Everyone is horrified by Kevin's latest painting, which depicts a twisted, prophetic version of Port Charles. In the painting, corpses are being carried out of the hospital, and the police department is now the Office of Enforcement. Everyone has red eyes except the people by the river, which means that the riverside is a feeding pen for the town's vampires. A bride and groom stand at the entrance to the church, on which a strange symbol has been painted. Joshua is presumably the groom, and Alison fears that she is the intended bride. Caleb realizes that Joshua intends to turn Port Charles into his own personal vampire nation.",
        "After his speech, Joshua uses the ring to activate a symbol on the back of each vampire's hand--the same symbol from the church in the painting."

        "Lucy: Yes, I am ready. I am ready to dance the night away. So, what do you think? What do you think? What do you think?",
        "Ian: You look nice.",
        "Lucy: I get a \"nice\"? That is just a \"nice\"?",
        "Ian: You -- huh.",
        "Lucy: Ok. I'll take that. But I know what you want. You want me to go to the hospital for those tests.",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, I know. You want to get me there to figure out what's going on with that toxin in my body and see what it's really doing to me and figure all that medical stuff out.",
        "Ian: Right.",
        "Lucy: Well, you told me that you could make me all better, so I believe that you can fix me so you have to stop worrying.",
        "Ian: How do you do that? How do -- how do you turn a grown man into mush like that?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I guess it's just a girl thing.",
        "Ian: Is it?",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ian: No, I think it's a Lucy thing. Ok. We'll go the party, and then I'll take you to the hospital.",
        "Lucy: Ok. And after the party, you can take me to the hospital and prod and poke me and do whatever you need to do for those silly tests. I'll go with you.",

        "Reese: Thanks for inviting me and everything, Jack, but this isn't really my kind of a scene. You know what I mean?",
        "Jack: I know, I know. I know it's not your usual freak show, but give it a chance. I have a feeling things could get interesting.",
        "Casey: Oh.",
        "Jamal: See one thing hasn't changed -- you always were down for a party. What's up?",

        "Mary: But we're so excited about everything that's happening -- Victor's new job and the money we'll get from the sale of this place. I can't think of how happy we are that we'll get to do all the things, finally, we wanted to do.",
        "Karen: It's wonderful, isn't it?",
        "Mary: It is. To think that at this stage of our lives, there are still surprises.",

        "Victor: I -- I'm not exactly sure. What happened?",

        "Victor: They will?",
        "Frank: How could they not? And with this new job being building commissioner -- I mean, hey, Victor, you are the man. You can finally get things done right around here.",

        "Frank: Yeah, well, get used to it. That feeling is here to stay.",
        "Victor: I still got some questions --",

        "Joshua: Go ahead. It's all right. We made a deal. I'm just keeping my end of the bargain. You don't trust me, do you? You still don't believe that I have no desire to cause you any harm. Oh, Livvie. you're a brave and beautiful woman. I have nothing but respect for you as a fellow vampire. Go ahead. Go on. Have your fill. Put an end to all your suffering. Go on.",

        "Jamal: What, they called you?",

        "Karen: Well, I happened to see a cute, little house for sale the other day.",
        "Frank: Yeah? And?",
        "Karen: And, well, I was thinking that maybe you might want to get it together.",
        "Frank: I think that is a fantastic idea.",
        "Karen: You do?",
        "Frank: Yeah, of course. Where is the place?",
        "Karen: Oh, it's a great location. It's right on the riverside.",

        "Caleb: Alison, get out of here. Go home.",
        "Alison: I'm not letting you do this by yourself.",
        "Caleb: Oh, why? Because you care so much about Olivia and me?",
        "Alison: Hardly. But right now you are the lesser of two evils.",
        "Caleb: I'm flattered -- I beat Joshua.",
        "Alison: Look, I remember what it was like being alone with Joshua, and I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy.",
        "Caleb: This is all very, very touching, but I don't need you getting in the way.",
        "Alison: Look, I'm not exactly thrilled about this, either. And I don't want to sit here and convince you of that, all right? But the truth is I don't know where Rafe is and you are in no shape to be playing hero by yourself.",
        "Caleb: I'm fine.",
        "Alison: Yeah, you look it.",
        "Caleb: Hey, look, just because I said a couple nice things to you back there doesn't mean you owe me something. Truth is I would've said anything to get you to let me go.",
        "Alison: Don't you think I know that, ok? I just don't want to think about Joshua holding any woman prisoner.",
        "Caleb: All right, fine. Let's just get going.",
        "Alison: Ok, wait, wait, though. What is your plan? Are we just going to waltz in there, huh, with all of Joshua's goons around? Let him stab you in the neck again?",
        "Caleb: Last time I underestimated Joshua. This time I won't.",
        "Alison: That -- that's your plan?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Except for one thing.",
        "Alison: What's that?",
        "Caleb: If something happens and it comes down to saving you or Olivia, I'm saving her first. You still want to come along? Yeah, I didn't think so.",
        "Alison: I'm coming with you. You're not going by yourself.",
        "Caleb: Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: What catch, Joshua?",
        "Joshua: You know, I really shouldn't tell you. Oh --",

        "[Glass breaks]",
        "Livvie: You're lying. I don't believe you.",
        "Joshua: You don't have to believe me. You can try it out for yourself.",
        "Livvie: I'll kill you for this. I'll kill you.",
        "Joshua: My. It works like a charm.",
        "Livvie: The ring. Caleb's ring.",
        "Joshua: You have no idea the power of this ring, and now it's mine. Now I have everything. I don't know if you made any plans for this evening, but I have a function to attend.",
        "Livvie: Caleb!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ok, well, I guess you really know your way around this place, don't you?",
        "Caleb: I should. It used to be mine, and it will be again.",
        "Alison: Do you think that Livvie is still in her cell?",
        "Caleb: Unless Joshua's moved her.",
        "Alison: How are we going to get in there with all his goons everywhere?",
        "Caleb: I know a secret entrance around the back.",
        "Alison: Oh, right, of course you do.",
        "[Alison gasps]",
        "Alison: Rafe.",
        "Rafe: You.",
        "Caleb: What is with the stake?",
        "Rafe: What the hell are you two doing here?",
        "Alison: We came to -- to get Livvie. What is the matter with you? What happened?",
        "Rafe: I'm fine. What -- what are you doing? I thought I told you to wait at home.",
        "Alison: I know, you did, but I never -- I never heard from you. My God, are you ok?",
        "Rafe: That's because I had to lay low. I had to let Joshua think his trap worked.",
        "Alison: You look awful. Should we go get you some help or something?",
        "Rafe: I'm fine. It's not as bad as Joshua wanted it to be.",
        "Caleb: I'll tell you what -- why don't you and your little girlfriend go on home. I'll take it from here.",
        "Rafe: Right, even though you should probably be in a hospital right now. Are you also for getting who the slayer is here?",
        "Caleb: Hey, have you looked in a mirror? Besides, have you forgotten who knows their way around here better than anyone?",
        "Rafe: Well, what difference does that make? If Joshua catches you, this whole thing --",
        "Alison: Stop it -- shh. Stop it. This is not the time or place.",
        "Rafe: Fine. Lead the way. Try not to get us killed, all right?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Karen: What's wrong, Frank? What's wrong with the house on the riverside?",
        "Frank: Well, I just have a feeling property values will be going down there.",
        "Karen: What?",
        "Frank: Look, we can live anywhere you want, just not the riverside.",
        "Karen: But you haven't seen this house --",
        "Frank: You know, I'm going to get you something to eat before all the good stuff's gone, all right?",
        "Chris: So, tell me, why is it that we haven't been properly introduced?",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm -- I guess you can say I've been a bit busy.",
        "Chris: Ah, busy. Well, I've been busy. Where have you been busy?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, boy, let me see -- being reunited with my long-lost daughter. Then I married a rock star who turned out to be a vampire, who subsequently dumped me, which led me to become involved with an even nastier vampire who keeps threatening to kill me.",
        "Chris: You sound like my kind of woman.",
        "Jack: Oh, he's going to go three. Everybody, he's going three!",
        "Victor: Whoa!",
        "Reese: You know, Jack, I think you're right. This party is going to be far more interesting than I thought.",
        "Casey: Wait, Ricky, what are you doing?",
        "Ricky: What? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that dancing was on the angelic list of no-nos.",
        "Casey: No, it's not. It's not.",
        "Ricky: All right, so what's the problem?",
        "Casey: Ricky, the -- the problem is we're not in that right place right now, all right?",
        "Ricky: Is that right? Is that right? Is that what it is?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Ricky: Is it really some mandate from above? Or has it got more to do with Jamal?",
        "Casey: With -- whatever, man.",
        "Jamal: Hey -- what's wrong, baby girl?",
        "Casey: Everything. Everything is wrong. Ricky's coming on to me. I'm having visions of Lucy's death. I don't even know what to think anymore. I don't know if they're trying to test me up there or what. I -- I just can't figure this out, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Want my advice?",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Jamal: Go with your instincts. Here's your chance.",
        "Victor: Ah!",
        "Lucy: Hey, you.",
        "Victor: What a nice surprise. Cherie, cherie.",
        "Lucy: I'm so happy for you. I'm so proud of you, too. You're going to be the best darn building commissioner there ever was.",
        "Victor: Well, I hope so. I haven't started yet.",
        "Lucy: I know, but -- wait a minute. I'm curious about something. Who is the moneybags guy? Who's backing this whole thing up, huh?",
        "Victor: I have no idea. I haven't even met him yet.",
        "Ian: That was weird.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I mean, he gets weird. Sometimes he gets really excited and he does -- not that. But usually he's a little --",
        "Ian: Look at that.",
        "Lucy: Frank. Well, wait a minute. How is that possible he's here? What is he doing here?",
        "Ian: I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't be here, either.",
        "Lucy: You're right, we shouldn't.",
        "Ian: Let's get out of here, the sooner the better.",

        "Mary: Champagne.",
        "Joshua: Thank you. How lovely to see you.",

        "Lucy: What? He -- of the recovery room?",
        "Mary: Yes. Isn't it wonderful? Come on. I want you to meet everybody that's here.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This is the most twisted thing I have ever seen.",
        "Rafe: It's not just a painting. It's a prophecy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to raise my glass to Joshua, Mr. Joshua Temple. Some of you already know that Mr. Temple is going to be the new owner of our beloved Recovery Room. And he is certainly Port Charles' newest, most-distinguished citizen. I haven't known him very long, but I can vouch for the fact that he's man of drive and vision. Ladies and gentlemen, Joshua Temple.",
        "All: Hear, hear!",
        "Lucy: This is so unbelievable.",
        "Casey: Now I've seen everything.",
        "Jamal: Uh-uh -- don't say that. Not in this town.",
        "Elizabeth: Joshua Temple, what are you up to now?",
        "Victor: Mr. Temple, won't you favor us with a few words for your new neighbors and patrons?",
        "All: Speech!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What is this, anyway?",
        "Rafe: Seems like Port Charles -- at least some bizarre version of it.",
        "Alison: No, it is Port Charles. That's the church downtown.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but there's some kind of strange symbol on there.",
        "Alison: Look at the hospital. There's G.H., Only they're not taking people in. They're carting out corpses.",
        "Rafe: PCPD. That's --",
        "Alison: \"Office of enforcement\"?",
        "Rafe: All the men, they -- they have red eyes.",
        "Alison: But the people down at the river -- they don't. They're normal.",
        "Rafe: They're mortals. That's a feeding pen.",
        "Alison: My God.",
        "Rafe: Wait a second, the man in the church -- that -- that could be Joshua.",
        "Alison: Yeah, the woman with the gown on -- my God, Rafe --",
        "Rafe: That -- that could be anyone.",
        "Alison: That could be me in that wedding gown.",
        "Caleb: Every king needs a queen to help him reign.",
        "Alison: To reign?",
        "Caleb: This picture -- Joshua intends to turn Port Charles into his own personal vampire nation.",
