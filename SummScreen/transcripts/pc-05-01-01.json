        "Kevin: Well, I'm looking forward to this about as much as a root canal. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but, come on, it's going to be swell. It's going to be fun. \r\nIt's not going to be fun at all, but we're doing this for Livvie. Come on, we \r\nhave to do it for Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's not easy to make small talk with a guy who's probably \r\nsleeping with your daughter. ",
        "Lucy: You're probably right. But, hey, they're young and they're hot \r\nfor each other, and so they're probably -- ",
        "Livvie: Late. Sorry. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. ",
        "Livvie: We got a little caught up. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, at work. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Oh -- oh, well, we were just talking about hot -- dishes, \r\ndishes. ",
        "Kevin: On the menu. ",
        "Lucy: Right, right, right. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, of course. ",
        "Kevin: Sit down. Sit. ",
        "Lucy: Please -- oh, please sit at the table. And a chair -- two chairs, \r\nplease. ",

        "Arianna: You did all this for me? ",
        "Ian: What, you think you're the only one that can decorate? ",
        "Arianna: I did see your bachelor flat. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, that was a look I was going for with the um -- thing. ",
        "Arianna: Thank you for this. For everything. I feel stronger already just \r\nbeing at home. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Ian: Excuse me. ",
        "Ian: Ah! Oh, I'm glad you could make it. ",
        "Chief: I came as soon as I got your message. ",
        "Arianna: Who is this? ",
        "Ian: This is the help you need -- the help we both need. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Here, drink this, Rhonda. I need you to help me figure this mess out.\r\n",
        "Rhonda: Hey, listen, I don't want to talk to you or anyone else about my \r\npast. ",
        "Frank: You have to. Now, the night you wanted to go to the school dance with \r\nScotty Baldwin, you'd been drinking, right? ",
        "Rhonda: Let's see -- if it was a weekend, I was drinking. If it was a week \r\nnight, I was drinking. ",
        "Frank: Rhonda, focus. Now tell me about that night. ",
        "Rhonda: Hey, why is some stupid dance so important to you, huh? ",
        "Frank: Look, I know all of this sounds crazy with me being the one who talked \r\nto you on the computer and all. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, especially since you were only about 3 years old back then. ",
        "Frank: But I'm telling you the truth. Now listen to me. You have to tell me \r\nexactly what happened that night because a life depends on it. ",
        "Rhonda: All right. All right, all right, all right. Let's see. Yeah, \r\nok. I was communicating with some guy on my dad's computer that night. He and I \r\nexchanged messages back and forth late into the night. ",
        "Cookie: \"You seem to care about me.\" ",
        "Cookie: \"I do care about you, which is why I don't want you going to this \r\ndance drunk.\" \"But I want this guy to notice me.\" \"Getting drunk, sleeping with \r\nsomeone so he'll like you is a mistake. Don't go.\" Ok. Ok, ok. \"All right, I \r\nwon't go. I'll stay home, sleep it off.\" ",
        "Rhonda: He told me that I did the right thing and that I -- ",
        "Frank: Had your whole life ahead of you. ",
        "Rhonda: How'd you know that? ",
        "Frank: Because I told you. It was me, Rhonda. As crazy as it seems, I was the \r\none writing to you on that computer back in 1973. It was me talking to you that \r\nnight. ",
        "Lucy: So, um, we are just so glad that the two of you could join us for \r\ndinner. ",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, we really appreciate the invitation. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: So, how's the bike shop? ",
        "Livvie: Really, really great. Jack is really good with his hands. ",
        "Jack: No, with the bikes -- I really like working with my hands on the bikes.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and he drives really well, too. The other night he took me for \r\nthe ride of my life. I just jumped on his -- ",
        "Lucy: Buns? ",
        "Jack: So, Dr. Collins, you must be proud of your daughter -- going to school, \r\npre-med. ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and Jack -- he really helps me study a lot. ",
        "Jack: Oh, the girl really knows her anatomy. ",
        "Lucy: What are we all having? For dinner? Waiter, yoo-hoo? Yoo-hoo. ",
        "Waiter: We have a special oyster appetizer. ",
        "Lucy, Kevin, Jack, Livvie: No. ",
        "Lucy: I just feel like something big, fat, and juicy. A steak. You know, not a \r\nsteak. On second thought, I'm going to have the breast of chicken -- the \r\nchicken's breast.",
        "Livvie: Can somebody please pass me the bread? ",
        "Lucy: Here you go -- buns. ",
        "Jack: Oh, would you like a pat on that? ",
        "Livvie: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: I'd like to propose a toast. ",
        "Lucy: Hmm. ",
        "Kevin: To this dinner, which is officially a fiasco. And to the joys of \r\nfatherhood. ",
        "[Kevin laughs] ",
        "Lucy: Hear, hear, I think. ",
        "Livvie: Cheers. ",
        "Jack: Cheers. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: Ian says you're a man of much wisdom. ",
        "Chief: Wisdom comes only from an open heart. I'm not so much wise as unafraid \r\nto seek the truth. ",
        "Arianna: I'm trying to face the truth about my condition. ",
        "Chief: Don't underestimate your own life force. I can feel it running strong \r\nstill inside you. You must let go of the guilt that haunts you and embrace life.\r\n",
        "Arianna: I will. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. She needs to rest. I don't know how much longer she can hold \r\non. ",
        "Chief: Faith is what you both need now. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. She gets sicker every day and I don't know how much faith I have \r\nleft. ",
        "Chief: That's when it's even more important to believe. Because the heart can \r\nsee what the eyes can't. And, Ian, I'm not at all convinced this woman will die.\r\n",
        "",
        "Frank: It's right in here, the computer I used to reach you on. I'll show \r\nyou, then maybe you'll understand. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, I don't see any computer. Is this some big scam or something?\r\n",
        "Frank: I swear it was right here. It's a big metal monster about this high \r\nfrom here to here, and it's got levers and wheels and lights and -- anyway, you \r\ncan't miss it. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, my dad used to have one of those. He kept it in the rec room.\r\n",
        "Frank: You were with me when I bought this at an auction, and Karen was there \r\n-- your daughter, Karen. ",
        "Rhonda: Are you sure you haven't been drinking? ",
        "Frank: We were going to restore it just for fun, and then I started getting \r\nmessages from a girl named Cookie. Karen warned me that something bad would \r\nhappen if I kept using the computer, but I didn't listen. God, I should have \r\nlistened to her. ",
        "Rhonda: You know, Frank, I think I'm going to maybe keep -- ",
        "Frank: No, no, wait, Rhonda. Please. You've got to believe me. You were in \r\ntrouble. You reached out to me. I thought I was helping, but I must have somehow \r\nscrewed up the way the future was supposed to be. Oh, wait. Wait, look -- look. \r\nThis is -- this is a note. You wrote it. Do you remember? ",
        "Rhonda: This can't be. How did you get this? ",
        "Frank: I asked you to write it and put it in the wall outside Kelly's. ",
        "Rhonda: No -- come on -- ",
        "Frank: Yes, yes, and I told you to wrap it in plastic because I would be \r\ngetting it 28 years later. ",
        "Rhonda: That's why you asked me about the dates, right? And who was \r\npresident? ",
        "Frank: Yes, and how I knew that I was somehow connected to someone in 1973 on \r\nthe damned computer that now seems to have vanished! ",
        "Rhonda: That's right. The day after the dance, my dad's computer broke. That \r\nwas the last message I got from you. Oh, my dad was furious. He thought that I \r\ndid it on purpose and -- I tried to tell him, you know, about the messages I was \r\ngetting from -- ",
        "Frank: You know, maybe, maybe we were able to contact each other because we \r\nwere on the same computer. ",
        "Rhonda: That day at Kelly's, all I wanted to do was meet you. You told me you \r\ncould help me. You know, I trusted and believed in you and look what happened \r\ntoday -- your stupid computer and you ruined my life.",
        "",
        "Lucy: Well, um, things seem to be going pretty well now -- I mean, in your \r\nlives, too. I mean, you're happy together and you started college. So \r\neverything's just about perfect, huh? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, almost everything. ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Hmm. ",
        "Lucy: What does that mean? ",
        "Jack: Well, Livvie seems to be a little worried about her grandma. She seems \r\nto be slipping a little. ",
        "Kevin: Slipping how? ",
        "Livvie: Well, she's happy and everything. And she's, you know, walking around \r\nthe apartment singing those fancy band tunes she likes, but then there's Archie.\r\n",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Archie? ",
        "Lucy: Did Estelle get a pet or something? ",
        "Livvie: I wish. Archie is her boyfriend, as in imaginary. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, she's been talking about him for the past two weeks. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Doc, you know, if she's reverting to her old behavior, she \r\ncould be very dangerous. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, I don't think it's that bad, really. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I could talk to her. I'd evaluate her condition -- I mean, if \r\nyou think she'd let me. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I think she's past thinking of you as the devil. ",
        "Lucy: She's not carrying around any sharp objects, is she? ",
        "Livvie: She's just a little confused. ",
        "Jack: But maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to just drop by for a \r\ncasual visit. ",
        "Lucy: That's a good idea. I mean, why don't we pretend that we're just making \r\nsure you get home safely and then we could see her, and it would kind of be the \r\nperfect setup without looking like a setup. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, or I could just have a talk with her, assess her condition. ",
        "Livvie: And you wouldn't mind? ",
        "Kevin: No. We'll go over there once we finish up here. ",
        "Jack: Hey, it couldn't hurt. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Well, she'll sleep through the night now. Ok. What is it you said \r\nearlier about her not dying? Is there something I'm missing, some treatment I \r\ndon't know about? ",
        "Chief: You're a man who uses your hands and medicines to cure. You're used to \r\ntaking action. But this time, it might be out of your control. ",
        "Ian: But it wasn't out of my control. I promised to take care of Arianna. I \r\ngave her my name so she would be here and be safe in this country. I promised to \r\nwatch over her and I didn't. ",
        "Chief: Oh, but, well, you did everything you could to protect this woman. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Wasn't enough, was it? You saw her. And all this happened because \r\nI couldn't wait to be with Eve. ",
        "Chief: Oh, wait, wait. Are you saying that if you hadn't given in to your \r\ndesire for Eve, a woman you've loved forever, you could have prevented the attack? \r\nAre you? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that Eve and I can't build our \r\nlife on Arianna's death. All this because of one careless moment. ",
        "Chief: You need to get back to believing. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I will, eventually. What I need right now is a miracle. ",
        "Chief: Miracles happen every day if you're not too blind to see them. ",
        "Ian: I want to believe that. I do. ",
        "Chief: Just don't close yourself off, my friend. There is an answer and it's \r\ncoming to you from a very unexpected place. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Rhonda, you have to believe -- when I was sending you those messages, \r\nI thought I was helping. ",
        "Rhonda: You know what my dad did when I told him about my little friend on \r\nthe computer? ",
        "Frank: He stopped you from using it? Is that why you didn't write me back \r\nagain? ",
        "Rhonda: No, he locked the computer in the basement and said that I could \r\nnever use it again. And then, just to be safe, he sent me to a mental \r\ninstitution for all the craziness I was spouting about messages and my mystery \r\nfriends on the computer. And then when the drugs didn't work, they tried to \r\nshock the truth out of me. ",
        "Frank: But no one could understand the truth, could they? ",
        "Rhonda: No. It was so much easier for them to think that I was some crazy \r\nperson hearing voices through the computer. And then when I -- I got out of the \r\nhospital, my lovely dad wouldn't have anything to do with me. Neither would \r\nanyone else. ",
        "Frank: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Rhonda: It's all right. At least I knew who I was, huh? Crazy Rhonda. Crazy \r\nRhonda who turned into drunken Rhonda. So, there it is, Frank. That's the \r\nbeautiful life you promised me 28 years ago and now you want me to dig it up \r\nagain. ",
        "Frank: I could back you up. I could explain that I was sending the messages \r\nbecause we're in this together now. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, yeah? What am I supposed to tell all my fans? That I was talking \r\nto you on the computer over decades? That I don't have a daughter, but I would \r\nhave had one if I would have shown up one night for some crummy dance? Not only \r\ndid you ruin my life, but now you want to come and finish the job. Is that what \r\nyou want? ",
        "Frank: What I want is your daughter back. ",
        "Rhonda: I don't have a daughter! ",
        "Frank: Yes, you do. Her name is Karen, and she is smart and she is beautiful \r\nand she is the most loving, caring person I ever met. And she's real, damn it. \r\nAnd I'm in love with her. She changed my life. She changed so many lives. In \r\nfact, she went on her way to the hospital to save a woman with liver -- oh, my \r\nGod. Oh, my God. Arianna may die now, too, because of what I did. ",
        "Rhonda: Ok, stop it, all right? I don't want to hear any more from you. I \r\ndon't want to hear about Karen or Arianna or the man in the moon because I think \r\nyou're the one who belongs in the hospital. ",
        "Frank: I didn't mean for any of this to happen. ",
        "Rhonda: It's just a little too late for your apology, all right? You took me \r\non this pathetic road trip that led right here to my miserable, awful life 28 \r\nyears ago. And now what do you want? You want me to say I'm -- thank you for \r\nthat? ",
        "Frank: Look, I know I can't possibly make this up to you, but I can get your \r\ndaughter back. We just need to find that computer and put the past back the way \r\nit should have been. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, no, no, no. You're crazy. No, I'm not going to do that. What do \r\nyou think, the crazy stares? People talking behind my back? Is that what you \r\nwant me to do? You are nuts, Frank. ",
        "Frank: Rhonda, wait. You've got to believe me. ",
        "Rhonda: I do believe you, Frank. That's the problem. But your precious \r\ncomputer can stay where it's been for 28 years -- locked up in my basement. I \r\nhope it rots there. ",
        "Frank: Wait -- is that where it is? Is it still there? ",
        "Rhonda: Well, why don't you go and tell everyone you've been talking to the \r\npast? Ok, I want to see how they treat you. I want to see if they put you \r\nthrough the hell they put me through. And from where I'm sitting, you deserve \r\nevery minute of it. ",
        "Frank: Rhonda, please, I need your help. ",
        "Rhonda: Don't you ever, ever, ever ask me for my help again.\u00a0 Do \r\nyou understand that?",

        "Livvie: I'm sorry, Grandma. Yeah -- Archie is real, and Grandma is not \r\nwearing flannel. ",
        "Kevin: Well, look on the bright side. At least it's safe to say that \r\nEstelle's mind is working just fine. ",

        "Ian: Who is this person? How do I find them? ",
