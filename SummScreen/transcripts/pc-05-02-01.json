        "Ian: There you go. Ah. Drink up. It's good for you. ",
        "Arianna: Ian -- ",
        "Ian: Drink up. Mmm, mmm. ",
        "Arianna: It's delicious. Thank you. And thank you for bringing me back here.\r\n",
        "Ian: Hey, this is your home. ",
        "Arianna: I can't tell you what it means just to look out the window and be \r\nable to see the sun rise. ",
        "Ian: I was thinking. Maybe I should get up early and watch them with you. ",
        "Arianna: You don't have to do this. ",
        "Ian: I don't mind getting up early. I mean, you know, it's all right. ",
        "Arianna: You know what I mean -- spending every single minute with me. ",
        "Ian: Right now there's nothing more important than you. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Eve, would you relax? This is routine. ",
        "Eve: There is nothing routine about having a baby. Especially when it's like \r\nthis. ",
        "Chris: Look, I know that Ian should be the one here with you today. ",
        "Eve: It should be the happiest day of our life. We should be out celebrating \r\ninstead of going to some out-of-the-way doctor and using some fake name like \r\nI've committed a crime. Maybe I have. ",
        "Chris: What's that supposed to mean? ",
        "Eve: This child's life is at the expense of another's. ",
        "Chris: Eve, Arianna still has a chance. ",
        "Eve: A million to one and it's getting slimmer. ",
        "Chris: Look, I'm sorry things worked out the way they did. And I'm sorry you \r\njust have my hand to hold onto today. ",
        "Eve: Hey, I'm grateful for that hand. ",
        "Doctor: Eve Miller? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, that's me. ",
        "Doctor: And you must be Mr. Miller, the lucky father. ",
        "Eve: Uh -- ",
        "Chris: Well, yes. Yes, I certainly am. Nice to meet you. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Thanks for waking me up the way you did. ",
        "Lucy: Well, thank you for cooking me such a yummy breakfast. ",
        "Kevin: Hmm, my pleasure. ",
        "Kevin: Can I ask what's so funny? ",
        "Lucy: I was just reminded of Archie. ",
        "Kevin: Archie. Aww. My kisses make you think of a 70-year-old man. ",
        "Lucy: Well, no, but I can't help it. Just the thought of Estelle and Archie \r\nmaking out like a couple of teenagers. It's -- it's cute. ",
        "Kevin: You think we'll be that cute when we're their age? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, we'll be much, much cuter. Ooh, I got to go. ",
        "Kevin: Hmm? ",
        "Lucy: I do. I have something I sort of need to do. ",
        "Kevin: What? What? ",
        "Lucy: It's kind of a mission of mercy. So, I'll catch you later, Archie. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, yeah. Can't wait, Estelle. See you. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Joe. Hi. ",
        "Joe: Lucy, have you seen -- there he is. ",
        "Lucy: I'm -- I'm fine. Glad you are. ",
        "Joe: Kevin, hey. ",
        "Kevin: Hi, Joe. ",
        "Joe: You got a minute? ",
        "Kevin: Sure. What's up? ",
        "Joe: I'm kind of worried about Frank. ",
        "Kevin: Any more than usual? I'm sorry. What can I do? ",
        "Joe: Look, he was acting kind of strange last night, looking for some girl he \r\nclaims to be in love with -- a girl named Karen Wexler. Rhonda Wexler's \r\ndaughter. ",
        "Kevin: Rhonda Wexler -- ",
        "Joe and Kevin: Doesn't have a daughter. ",
        "Joe: I know. Only he's convinced himself for some reason that she does. ",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe she has a daughter that we don't know about. ",
        "Joe: No, uh-uh. He insists that this nonexistent daughter works here at G.H. \r\nand that we're all supposed to know who she is. ",
        "Kevin: Karen Wexler. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, ring any bells? ",
        "Kevin: No, I've never heard of her. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Rhonda! Rhonda. ",
        "Frank: Rhonda. ",
        "Rhonda: Oh -- God. Frankie, it's you. Come on, I told you to leave me alone.\r\n",
        "Frank: I have to find Karen. ",
        "Rhonda: Come on, I told you to stop asking me that. Get out of here. ",
        "Frank: Not until I see the computer. You told me it was here. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, well, I lied. ",
        "Frank: Rhonda, where is it? ",
        "Rhonda: Oh, it doesn't matter. Come on, just go. ",
        "Frank: No, it matters to me, Rhonda. Where is it? Tell me where it is, \r\nRhonda. Where's the computer? Where is it? ",
        "Rhonda: Why do you want them to think I'm a crazy person? ",
        "Frank: Rhonda, just tell me where the computer is. Tell me! ",
        "Rhonda: It's in the basement. It's where -- hey, you can't go down there. You \r\ncan't go down there. I got to do something. Got to get him out. ",
        "Frank: I'm coming, Karen. I'm going to find you. And I'll bring you home. ",
        "Rhonda: Hey, Joe, it's Rhonda. Your brother's really crazy. He broke into my \r\nhouse. ",
        "Joe: Calm down. What's Frank doing? ",
        "Rhonda: He keeps on talking on and on and on about this girl, and I can't get \r\nhim to leave. ",
        "Joe: All right. Put him on the phone. ",
        "Rhonda: No, no, no. You come over here and get rid of him, ok? I'm going to \r\ncall the cops. ",
        "",
        "Joe: Colleen, will you sign me out? I have to go. ",
        "Colleen: Sure, of course. Is Frank all right? ",
        "Joe: No, I don't think he is. ",
        "Kevin: Joe, what's going on? ",
        "Joe: Frank broke into Rhonda's house looking for her phantom daughter again.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I'd better go with you. ",

        "Eve: Well? ",
        "Doctor: Excellent. 110/80. ",
        "Eve: Are you sure? I mean, because -- I'm sorry, I'm just really nervous. ",
        "Doctor: Well, that's natural, especially since you've already lost a child.\r\n",
        "Eve: I don't think I could go through that again. ",
        "Doctor: As long as you take good care of yourself this time, you shouldn't \r\nhave any problems. ",
        "[Intercom buzzes] ",
        "Doctor: Excuse me. ",
        "Eve: Oh, Dr. Fransen? One thing about the blood work -- ",
        "Dr. Fransen: Oh. I'll put a rush on it just to ease your minds. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Chris: Thanks. We appreciate it. ",
        "Eve: Why are you pretending to be the father? ",
        "Chris: I just figured it would make things easier, that's all. Wouldn't have \r\nto go into your whole life story. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but it's nobody's business who the father is. ",
        "Chris: I know. Nobody's but Ian's. Are you ever going to tell him? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. ",
        "Chris: Eve, you understand that there are options. ",
        "Eve: That is not an option. ",
        "Chris: Eve -- ",
        "Eve: No, Ian and I can't be together right now, but we love each other more \r\nthan anything, and this baby is a result of that. ",
        "Chris: All I'm saying is -- ",
        "Eve: I know the timing couldn't be worse, but there is no way that I am going \r\nto lose this child. ",

        "Ian: Come on. You'd be much more comfortable in bed. All right. ",
        "Lucy: Who are you? ",
        "Chief: A visitor from Tirama Island. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh. You're the chief, aren't you? You're the one. Your -- your \r\nholiness. ",
        "",
        "Frank's Voice: \"Have I ever let you down?\" \"No.\" \"Then believe me when I tell \r\nyou going to this dance tonight would be a very big mistake.\" It was all real. \r\nOh, my God, Karen. What have I done? I changed the past, and now you don't \r\nexist. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I just -- I can't tell you what an honor it is to meet you. I've been \r\ndying to. I've been thinking about it every minute since Ian told me about you.\r\n",
        "Chief: Told you? ",
        "Lucy: Yes -- you know, about all the past lives stuff. ",
        "Chief: He shared that with you? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I mean, we happen to be very close friends, and -- and -- \r\nactually, you know, I know he wanted to. He probably just didn't think that I \r\nwould believe him, but -- ok, I sort of had to coax it out of him. In fact, I \r\nsort of -- it was like pulling teeth. But he was happy he told me. He really was \r\nglad once he realized how glad I was to hear it because he knows I really \r\nbelieve. Listen, I believe that everybody -- the universe sends you somebody \r\nthrough the ages. Like, through hundreds and hundreds of years and all your past \r\nlives, you meet this person, and you get to relive them if you can and -- you \r\nknow what? I think about it sometimes and I just get totally speechless. I can't \r\ntalk. ",
        "Chief: I can see that. ",
        "Lucy: It's totally spiritual, isn't it? I mean, it's so enlightening. If a \r\nperson got to actually experience that and go through it, it would change their \r\nlives forever, huh? ",
        "Chief: You wouldn't by any chance want to visit Tirama and visit your own \r\npast? ",
        "Lucy: No. Yeah. I would. Oh, gosh, I would. I would give anything if I could \r\ndo that. It would mean everything. ",
        "Chief: Perhaps it could happen, in good time. ",
        "Lucy: Really? ",
        "Chief: I'm sure you know you're possessed with a very special gift. ",
        "Lucy: Do you actually feel that? ",
        "Chief: I could feel the presence of a kindred spirit even before you entered \r\nthe room. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my goodness. You are a very wise and very perceptive man. Oh. ",
        "Ian: Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Hi. ",
        "Ian: Hi. What are you up to? ",
        "Chief: We've just been getting acquainted. Your friend is most charming. ",
        "Ian: Ah. Yeah, that's what I'm scared of. ",
        "Chief: Well, if you two will excuse me, I was just going for a walk. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. ",
        "Lucy: Could I touch you? I mean, shake your hand? Please? Oh, thank you. I -- \r\nI can't tell you -- I'm so honored to meet you, really, and could we maybe talk \r\nlater? ",
        "Chief: I'm sure we will. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Ta. ",
        "Chief: Goodbye. ",
        "Lucy: Goodbye. Ta. Bye. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Lucy: That's the guy! That's him! Wow, that's the chief. I can't believe I \r\ntouched him. I've met him and I've touched him. ",
        "Ian: Lucy -- Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: He's here in your place in Port Charles. What? ",
        "Ian: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Ian: What are you up to? ",
        "Lucy: I -- I -- I -- oh. Hold on. I brought you -- I brought you something. \r\nHere, I wanted to give you this. It's on the hospital's home hospice care for \r\nArianna. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: But you know what? I am not absolutely sure you're going to need it \r\nbecause sometimes unbelievable, amazing things like what just happened happen. I \r\nmean, miracles, even. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Well, we're clean out of miracles. Do you want some tea? ",
        "Lucy: No, I don't. I want you to listen to me. Look, miracles can happen. You \r\ndon't have to necessarily believe in them and they can happen. Wait -- what if \r\n-- just what if -- go with me on this -- if Arianna got all better -- ",
        "Ian: I want to hear this. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, you're going to hear it because I've been thinking about this. And \r\nwe, the four of us -- you and me and Kevin and Eve -- we've all gone through a \r\nlot of craziness. ",
        "Ian: Oh, no -- maybe I don't want to hear this. ",
        "Lucy: No, listen to me. To find -- no. We find each other and the destiny \r\nthing happens, right? So you're going to hear it because I have to tell you this \r\nbecause I am your very good friend, and I just -- I can't do it. I can't sit by \r\nand watch you do this. ",
        "Ian: Do what? ",
        "Lucy: Completely ruin your life. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I want this baby more than anything. ",
        "Chris: Eve, if it's because of the baby you lost -- ",
        "Eve: No, no, no. This is because this baby is already a part of me, and it's \r\na part of Ian. And it feels right. It feels like this is the most right thing \r\nI'll ever do. ",
        "Chris: I understand. I actually felt like that once. ",
        "Eve: You're still not over Julie, are you? ",
        "Chris: I don't know. It's just that, you know, I felt like we were going to \r\nbe forever, you know? ",
        "Eve: She loved you, Chris. If it hadn't been for that custody battle over \r\nChristina -- ",
        "Chris: Don't -- don't do that because, see, that doesn't make it any easier. \r\nEve, I wanted revenge. I wanted revenge on everyone who caused her all that \r\npain. The funny thing is no matter what I did, it never made it hurt any less.\r\n",
        "Eve: Take it from me -- laying blame never does. ",
        "Chris: You certainly didn't learn that at home. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Neither did you. That's why we understand each other so well. And \r\nthat's why, just like you, I want a happy ending. ",
        "Dr. Fransen: Good news. The lab isn't backed up, for a change. I'll have your \r\nblood test results in a few hours. ",
        "Eve: Good. So that's it? ",
        "Dr. Fransen: For now. Meantime, take your prenatal vitamins and get plenty of \r\nrest. ",
        "Eve: I will. Thank you, Dr. Fransen, for everything. ",
        "Dr. Fransen: I'll see you again soon. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Chris: Thank you. How about some lunch, huh? ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Chris: There's a salad bar place around the corner. ",
