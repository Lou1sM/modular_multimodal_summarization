        "Frank tries to explain things to Karen, who doesn't understand him at all. She's afraid that he wants to turn her into a vampire, but Frank promises not to do that unless she wants him to. Karen is saddened to think that she isn't enough for the man who used to be her hero. Jack uses his thievery to persuade Joshua to hire him as the manager of Elixir. Casey worries about not getting any help from above. She's not even sure whether she's supposed to be guarding Lucy or Ricky. Casey rejects Jamal's idea that she's supposed to save the entire town. She misinterprets a compliment from Jamal as a come-on. Sitting down with a glass of champagne, Joshua drinks to Alison, his future bride. Fearing that Joshua intends to make Alison his bride, Rafe comes up with a plan to keep her safe. Although Alison resists, Rafe insists that they are getting out of town. Frank watches them leave the apartment and then reports back to Joshua. Olivia tells Caleb that Joshua added something to the blood she drank. It poisoned her fangs, and anyone she bites will die. Caleb is willing to take that chance, but Olivia can't go through with it. Caleb grabs one of Joshua's goons and allows Olivia to bite the man's neck. Olivia is devastated when the man dies, because it means that she is poison to Caleb."

        "Karen: Stay away from me, Frank.",
        "Frank: I can't. I have to make you understand.",
        "Karen: What? What? That you sold your soul for a real estate deal?",
        "Frank: Joshua has vision and big plans for this town. Things are going to be better around here.",
        "Karen: You know, if you believe that, then I really don't know you, Frank. Oh, wait. Wait a minute. Yes, I do -- you're a vampire now!",
        "Frank: I'm the man who loves you. That hasn't changed.",
        "Karen: Only now when you say that you love me forever, there's a whole new spin to it.",
        "Frank: Look, Karen, we can still have a life together, a better life.",
        "Karen: How? Oh, my God. Are you going to turn me, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: I've made a few calls to some of the power structures in town, contacts about some of these properties that you need to buy.",
        "Joshua: Good, Victor. I knew you were the perfect man for the job. You keep up the good work. Thank you.",
        "Victor: Well, thank you Joshua. I -- I really feel as if I have a whole new lease on life -- thanks to you.",
        "Joshua: Hmm. Well, young Jack. What can I do for you?",
        "Jack: It's what I can do for you, sir, if you give me a job.",
        "Joshua: Oh. Ok. I could always use someone to sweep up the floor, take out the garbage.",
        "Jack: That's not what I had in mind. You need someone to run this place.",
        "Joshua: Send me your resume, and I'll get right back to you.",
        "Jack: Here's my resume.",
        "Joshua: This is my wallet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This is like a really bad nightmare, something that I wish I could just wake up from.",
        "Rafe: All right, just stop, please. I mean, we don't even know for sure if Joshua's after you.",
        "Alison: Once he got the ring from Livvie, she was defenseless, so there was nothing to stop him from making her his bride.",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh. But you're right, he didn't.",
        "Alison: No, he didn't. What's going on? Whoa. Wait, whoa. Where are we going?",
        "Rafe: Well, Joshua can't get to you if he can't find you. That's why we're leaving Port Charles -- tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: What do you mean, you can't?",
        "Livvie: I can't do it.",
        "Caleb: You can. Make me whole again.",
        "Livvie: I want that more than anything. But I've ruined everything.",
        "Caleb: What happened? What happened, Olivia?",
        "Livvie: Nothing.",
        "Caleb: Hey, listen to me. I need you to tell me why you can't turn me. Tell me!",
        "Livvie: Because if I do, I'll kill you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Ok, boss, you got me, all right? I'm stumped. Ok, I know -- I know you sent me down here to do a job, and it's getting really complicated, ok? Look, I know I'm a guardian angel, all right? Whose back do I have? Huh? Is it Lucy? Am I supposed to save Lucy? Or is it Ricky? Is, is he the reason why I'm here? Because if he is the reason why I'm here, then you know how I feel about Ricky, right? Look, I know there's a reason for me being here, boss. I just -- I wish you'd hook me up with some bigger signs, man. Look -- why am I here? Huh? Who am I supposed to save?",
        "Jamal: Maybe you're supposed to save the whole damn town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Don't look at me like that, Karen, like I'm some kind of animal.",
        "Karen: Well, you're scaring me, ok?",
        "Frank: I won't turn you. I'd never do that unless you asked me to.",
        "Karen: You think that's something I'd want? I'm out of here.",
        "Frank: Oh, so that's it? You're walking out on me again?",
        "Karen: Do you blame me? It's like you're a magnet for the dark side.",
        "Frank: I had no choice in this. It just happened.",
        "Karen: Well, you have a choice now. You can go join your zombie friends, or you can fight this. If you do, I promise to stay by your side and fight with you, Frank.",
        "Frank: I don't need you to fight for me, just -- just be with me. You have my heart.",
        "Karen: And you're about to lose your soul. How can that be ok with you? You're the man who went back in time for our love. You were my hero. I don't understand why you need shrouds or fangs --",
        "Frank: Because they make me feel stronger, ok, better. Like I'm somebody.",
        "Karen: You were always somebody to me, Frank. I'm just sorry I wasn't enough for you. Goodbye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: From your cocky attitude, you're pretty pleased with yourself, aren't you?",
        "Jack: With all your heightened vampire senses, I took your wallet right from under your nose.",
        "Joshua: You went through a lot of trouble to get my attention. What do you want? Do you want your fangs back?",
        "Jack: Not exactly. I've already been down that road before. I like to live fast and die young.",
        "Joshua: Then what can I possibly do for you?",
        "Jack: I've been butting heads with your kind for a while now, and where has it gotten me? Nowhere. Joshua, you're the one who calls the shots these days, and I want to be close to that power. When the train leaves the station, I want to be onboard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Wait. No --",
        "Rafe: Come on.",
        "Alison: I -- no. Listen, Joshua is turning this whole town into vampire central. We can't just take off.",
        "Rafe: You know what? If I don't get you out of here, I might as well take you and walk you down the aisle myself and give you away to that creep. Would you like that?",
        "Alison: So you do think that he's coming after me.",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I just don't want to take any chances, all right? Let's go. Please?",
        "Alison: What about Lucy? We can't just leave her.",
        "Rafe: Lucy is a survivor. She'll be fine. She's got Ian.",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, ok. Ok, one thing at a time.",
        "Alison: You are the only one who can stop Joshua. You are the only chance anyone has.",
        "Rafe: Right now, all I'm worried about is you. I want to make you safe. So, please, come on.",
        "Alison: No. I'm not leaving.",
        "Rafe: We can't do this. We can't waste any more time, all right?",
        "Alison: This is about me. Do I not get a vote in this at least?",
        "Rafe: No. Look, what do I have to do? Do I have to take you, put you over my shoulder, and carry you out of here? Because I'll do that. Can you please just trust me for a second? Just trust me that I have a plan.",
        "Alison: I do trust you. I do, believe me. But I want to know what the plan is first.",
        "Rafe: On the way. Come on.",
        "Alison: No -- no, now.",
        "Rafe: You are so damn stubborn. Come here. Sit down. Now, listen to me closely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I don't know how turning me will kill me.",
        "Livvie: I did something terrible. And that's why I can't help you now.",
        "Caleb: What happened?",
        "Livvie: I was scared. And I was -- I was really hungry. I thought I was going to die, and Joshua -- offered me some blood.",
        "Caleb: You couldn't help yourself. The urge is too strong.",
        "Livvie: Then he laughed, and he told me that there was something in the blood, that he had put something in there to poison my fangs. Now anyone I bite will die.",
        "Caleb: How do you know Joshua was telling the truth?",
        "Livvie: I don't. But it seems like the kind of thing he would do.",
        "Caleb: No. No, he's just trying to scare you.",
        "Livvie: Well, it worked.",
        "Caleb: Hey -- you listen to me. We are not going to let him stop us from being together.",
        "Livvie: I'm just so afraid I'll hurt you.",
        "Caleb: Fear -- fear is what he's counting on.",
        "Livvie: Oh, Caleb --",
        "Caleb: Give me what I need, sweetheart. Only you can give me my life back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Jamal --",
        "Jamal: What?",
        "Casey: Do not ever sneak up on a girl like that. What is wrong with you?",
        "Jamal: Well, I figured it was safe and all, you talking to God and everything.",
        "Casey: No, no, it doesn't work that way.",
        "Jamal: Oh, I know. I know -- not even angels get to talk to God, right?",
        "Casey: Not my rank, anyway.",
        "Jamal: Whoever you were just now talking to --",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Jamal: Did you get any answers? Anything come to you?",
        "Casey: No. About me saving the whole town?",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm?",
        "Casey: No. Jamal, we work more on a one-on-one type of situation, ok?",
        "Jamal: Oh.",
        "Casey: And I'm still trying to figure out who my one is. Man, is it Lucy? Am I supposed to stay and keep her alive? Or is it Ricky? Am I supposed to stop him, like, keep him from being one of the bloodsuckers? I don't know. I'm not even sure. And since I don't have clue one on which one it is, I'm just probably going to mess up. Mess up and then get yanked back upstairs again, right?",
        "Jamal: You know what I think you don't get, Casey?",
        "Casey: I don't get a lot of things. Ok, what -- what? What do you think? What?",
        "Jamal: I think that you don't get how special you really are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: That was quite a stirring speech. I never figured you to be e to be so eloquent.",
        "Jack: Well, people change.",
        "Joshua: But you shouldn't pull a sting on the person who's got all the power, Jack. That's not very smart. You stole from me. You're a common criminal.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't say \"common.\"",
        "Joshua: You tried to make a fool out of me. Not too clever, Jack. I could dispose of you --",
        "jack: But you won't.",
        "Joshua: Because?",
        "Jack: Because I could be useful to you and you wouldn't throw away anything that you could use.",
        "Joshua: That's assuming that I could trust you.",
        "Jack: Joshua, I could have flaunted my little trick in front of your boys, but I didn't.",
        "Joshua: And I should be so grateful for that, why don't I just give you a job? Forget about --",
        "Jack: No, you will hire me because you want this place to be a success. So you're going to need someone from the other side to help you run it and you can't kill me because, well, if I was dead, then I couldn't run your club.",
        "Joshua: Hmm. You got guts and a killer instinct.",
        "Jack: Thank you. That's a compliment coming from you.",
        "Joshua: Do you know what? I'll give you a chance. One false move --",
        "Jack: And you'll bury me.",
        "Joshua: Alive.",
        "Jack: Got it.",
        "Joshua: One more thing, Jack. You left my wallet empty.",
        "Jack: Consider it a signing bonus. I'll see you in the A.M., Boss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: Oh, Frank, how could you do this to us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Sorry. Karen can't see what I'm offering her.",
        "Joshua: And I'm interested in your personal problems because --",
        "Frank: You're right. I can't be distracted.",
        "Joshua: Keep your eye on the ball, Frank.",
        "Frank: Yes, sir.",
        "Joshua: Besides, I have a very important job for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So that's your plan?",
        "Rafe: You up for it?",
        "Alison: Yeah, if it's the only way.",
        "Rafe: Well, here's the thing -- I keep trying to think of another way, and it's just not working out. So I'll understand if you want to back out of this, ok?",
        "Alison: No. We're in this together. There's just -- there's just one thing that freaks me out about this.",
        "Rafe: Just one?",
        "Alison: Do we have to go there, of all places?",
        "Rafe: It's the last place any of his evil crew would look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Don't -- don't stop! Don't stop.",
        "Livvie: I have to resist this.",
        "Caleb: That's what he wants. He wants to keep us apart.",
        "Livvie: No, he wants to kill you, and he's going to use me to do it.",
        "Caleb: It won't kill me, it'll save me.",
        "Livvie: I hope Joshua's lying, but your life is too precious to gamble with.",
        "Caleb: Don't you see? As I am now, I might as well be dead.",
        "Livvie: Don't say that. I can't live without you.",
        "Caleb: Do you know what it's like for me to be ordinary? This feeling of helplessness?",
        "Livvie: I remember.",
        "Caleb: I can't go on this way much longer. Being with you, not being able to have you. We -- we have to settle this.",
        "[Noise]",
        "Livvie: Someone's coming.",
        "Caleb: Just what we need -- a volunteer.",
        "Livvie: No, no, no. Please, Caleb, it's too dangerous.",
        "Caleb: Hey! You! It's your old boss. Long time no see.",
        "Man: I don't take orders from you anymore. I work for Mr. Temple now.",
        "Caleb: Well, then consider yourself fired. Go ahead. He's all yours. Go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Are you coming on to me?",
        "Jamal: I'm -- whoa. Whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, what did you say? What?",
        "Casey: \"You don't know how special you really are, Casey\"? Man, if that is not a pickup line, then I don't know what that was.",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop. It wasn't. It was not, no. What I mean was that there's a lot of evil in the world, ok? There's a lot of evil that ended up in this town.",
        "Casey: Uh-huh.",
        "Jamal: Ok, and if Joshua has it his way, it's going to get a lot worse. What I meant is that for whatever reason that you're here, I don't know, but it means that the good guys haven't given up yet, that there's still hope. That's what I meant to say.",
        "Casey: I never -- I never thought of it that way.",
        "Jamal: Well, think of it that way. Oh -- all right, what was that for?",
        "Casey: That's for being pretty darn special yourself. Thank you, Jamal. I needed that.",
        "Jamal: No problem.",
        "Casey: You are pretty cute, so, you know, I totally understand if you had this thing for me, you know --",
        "Jamal: Oh, Case, Case --",
        "Casey: And that's all good, you know, because --",
        "Jamal: Case, just stop while you're behind, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Whoa, come on. Give me that back.",
        "Reese: Come get them. Oh! So, you managed to convince Josh?",
        "Jack: Yes, I did. You are looking at the new manager of the Elixir.",
        "Reese: Wow, you don't waste any time.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. Vampires aren't the only ones who get what they want.",
        "Reese: Oh, yeah? And what is it that you want? Ooh. I'm not sure if I can trust you yet.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, probably not.",
        "Reese: Oh, that makes it interesting.",
        "Jack: Very interesting. And now that I'm working at the club, it could be very profitable, too.",
        "Reese: Oh, I like the sound of that. So, what do we do to celebrate your newfound luck?",
        "Jack: Oh, no, I don't think that that was luck. I played the man, plain and simple.",
        "Reese: Playing -- hmm -- such a good idea. Have I told you how absolutely adorable your wild side is?",
        "Jack: Show me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Not bad for a day's work.",
        "Victor: Incredible day. I ought to be tired, but I'm not. I hate to leave you here all alone. You know, that new sign -- \"Elixir\" -- that's a new name. It's kind of catchy.",
        "Joshua: I won't be celebrating, not alone, for long.",
        "Victor: Oh, yeah? Somebody special?",
        "Joshua: You could say that.",
        "Victor: Well, she's a very lucky girl. Good night, boss.",
        "Joshua: Good night.",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "Joshua: Well. I've got my kingdom. All I need now is my queen. Here's to you, Alison, my future, lovely bride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Shouldn't we at least, like, leave a note or something?",
        "Rafe: No. Come on.",
        "Alison: But my nana and Jamal will probably worry.",
        "Rafe: At least you'll be safe, all right? That's what will really matter to them. Now, it's time to go. Let's go.",
        "Alison: Wait. Before, when -- when you asked me to trust you?",
        "Rafe: Yeah?",
        "Alison: I hope you know I do with my life.",
        "Rafe: Good. Good. You hold onto that thought.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: All right? Now, hurry up.",
        "Rafe: Come on.",

        "Caleb: So far, so good. He's getting up.",
        "Man: You will pay for this.",
        "Livvie: Is he?",
        "Caleb: He's dead. Hey --",
        "Livvie: Oh, it's true. I'm poison to you. I'm poison to the man I love.",
        "Caleb: Come here. Come here. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Rafe: All I care about is keeping you safe. I want to keep you away from Joshua and all his goons.",
        "Joshua: What you are going to do is ease Alison into her new lifestyle -- as my wife.",
        "Livvie: I'm afraid.",
