        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Jack: I can see why Zach still wants you racing for him. Man, you still got \r\nthe moves. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, man, but it's been a while, bro. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, you haven't lost a thing. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I better not have because everything I got is riding on \r\ntonight's race. ",
        "Jack: I can't believe Sam almost hit Alison with her bike. And doesn't Zach \r\nknow she's off-limits? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, not until her debt is cleared. I mean, that's what he \r\nwants me to know, you know. Dude, I got to win tonight, man -- before he really \r\nhurts Alison. ",
        "",
        "Alison: So how long you think your grandma and Archie have been -- ",
        "Livvie: Oh, please, please. I don't even want to think about it. She is my \r\ngrandma. Now, come on, what do we have left to do for tonight? ",
        "Alison: Nothing, really. We've made the goodies to eat before dinner, we got \r\nthe steaks marinating, you have brought the candles and the music -- ",
        "Livvie: Now all we need to do is reserve our guys for the evening. ",
        "Alison: Like they're not going to be so psyched. ",
        "Jamal: Ladies. ",
        "Alison: You two are in for a fabulous dinner tonight. ",
        "Jamal: Uh, sorry, baby. ",
        "Alison: \"Sorry, baby?\" What's does that mean? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I can't make it. ",
        "Alison: All right, what is going on? And don't leave out any details. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Tell me about her. Tell me about this girl. ",
        "Frank: Karen. Her name's Karen. ",
        "Kevin: Right. Karen Wexler. ",
        "Frank: What do you want to know? ",
        "Kevin: How did you meet? ",
        "Frank: I've known her my whole life. So has Joe. ",
        "Kevin: But Joe doesn't remember her. ",
        "Frank: No. Because I made her disappear. The most incredible woman I have \r\never met in my life no longer exists because of me. You -- you don't believe me. \r\nWhy are we even talking? You might as well go. ",
        "Kevin: What if I said I did believe you? She's real to you. So maybe there is \r\na Karen Wexler. ",
        "",
        "Colleen: Ian? I thought you were taking some time off. ",
        "Ian: Picking up some medicine for Arianna. ",
        "Colleen: She's lucky to have someone like you looking out after her. ",
        "Ian: Right. ",
        "Colleen: Ian -- is there anything I can do? ",
        "Ian: No, thanks. ",
        "Chris: Hey, why don't you run, get out of here? I can cover for you. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, what am I supposed to do, sit around and watch pay-per-view in my \r\nhotel room? ",
        "Chris: No, but you could get some rest. You need it. ",
        "Eve: I need to stay busy. ",
        "Chris: Eve, you're tired, you're under a lot of stress, and you're pregnant.\r\n",
        "Eve: Shh! Keep it down! ",
        "Joe: Need a room! Need a room! ",
        "Paramedic: Heart rate is 82. Saturation was 88%, now 94 with bagging. ",
        "Eve: What do we got? ",
        "Joe: Rhonda Wexler, she's been here before. Suspected alcohol poisoning. ",
        "Ian: You guys need a hand? ",
        "Colleen: Hey, two's open. ",
        "Joe: All right, let's go. ",
        "Eve: Let's go. ",
        "",
        "Eve: How long's she been like this? ",
        "Joe: 20 minutes, just as long as it took to get here. ",
        "Chris: B.P.? ",
        "Eve: 110/70. ",
        "Ian: We need a C.B.C., a chem 10, U.A., and a blood alcohol test, please. ",
        "Chris: It's got to be off the chart. ",
        "Ian: Put a rush on it. ",
        "Colleen: Got it. ",
        "Eve: How's she doing? ",
        "Joe: Not good. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Nothing's going on, baby. I just -- I got an appointment. ",
        "Alison: Well, what kind of an appointment? ",
        "Jamal: Just -- I'm buying some parts from a guy across town, that's all. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you know -- you know how it is getting this place off the \r\nground, sweetie. It's just -- you know, you got to work day and night. ",
        "Alison: I know. It's just that I wanted to celebrate, you know, how -- how \r\ngreat this place is doing and how great we're all doing. ",
        "Jack: Well, hey, why don't we do it another night, like tomorrow? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Livvie: But Alison already went through a lot of trouble tonight. Couldn't \r\nyou reschedule? ",
        "Jamal: Sorry, baby, I can't. It's like a one-time thing, you know? ",
        "Alison: That's ok. I understand. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'll be home later and I'll make it up to you. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Alison: It's just that I think -- ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know. I know. We need to make more time for each other away \r\nfrom work and from everything. And we will. Ok, I promise. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Love you. ",
        "Alison: I love you, too. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I'll be right back. ",
        "Jamal: Dude, you have got to watch her, and I mean close. ",
        "Jack: Until the race is over. I know. ",
        "Jamal: She'll be safe once I clear her debt. ",
        "Jack: Are you sure he'll back off? ",
        "Jamal: Dude, I will make sure. Ok, with that tape admitting all that shady \r\nstuff he's pulled. ",
        "Jack: So why not play the card now and not even race? ",
        "Jamal: Because he still has proof that Alison owes him money. But once he \r\nknows that he's got nothing on us and we got something on him -- ",
        "Jack: Home free. ",
        "Jamal: Exactly. ",
        "Jack: Except -- ",
        "Jamal: What? Except what? ",
        "Jack: Alison thinks the money came from her grandmother. All right? She's \r\ngoing to want to repay her. ",
        "Jamal: Look, after the race, I'll tell her what went down. So if we can make \r\nit through tonight, everything will be cool. ",
        "Amanda: Hello, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Granny. You're -- out of the hospital. ",
        "Amanda: Well, obviously. And I can't wait to see Alison. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Don't run that shrink number on me, Kevin. I know you don't believe \r\nany of this. ",
        "Kevin: But you haven't told me anything yet, not really -- how Karen \r\ndisappeared, why you feel responsible. Look, you want to tell someone. You might \r\nas well tell me. ",
        "Frank: Because I know how crazy it sounds. ",
        "Kevin: Try me. ",
        "Frank: Ok. Ok. I bought an old computer at an auction. Got it up and running. \r\nSomehow I connected to a girl named Cookie who was living in 1973. ",
        "Kevin: Cookie? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, it turns out Cookie's Rhonda Wexler. Anyway, I told her not to \r\ngo to a dance. ",
        "Kevin: Which was taking place in 1973. ",
        "Frank: That's right. She was going to meet a boy there. But I talked her out \r\nof going and, in the process, stopped the woman I love from ever being \r\nconceived. So Karen ceased to exist. See, how could I expect you to believe any \r\nof this without -- I could still hardly believe it myself. ",
        "Kevin: But you do. That's what's important. ",
        "Frank: I do because as impossible as it seems to you and everybody else, it's \r\nreal. ",
        "Kevin: And you love Karen. ",
        "Frank: It's the most real thing I've ever felt in my life. And I am never \r\ngoing to give up looking for her. I can't let myself forget her like everyone \r\nelse has. ",
        "Kevin: All right, all right, then tell me more about her. How did you fall in \r\nlove? I want to understand, Frank. ",
        "Frank: Well, it wasn't hard to do. The way her eyes sparkled when she smiled.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Describe her. Tell me what she looks like. ",
        "Frank: She -- she's beautiful, even when she's a mess. ",
        "Kevin: Her hair -- what color is it? ",
        "Frank: It's brown and thick. It's about down to here and kind of straight. \r\nHer eyes are brown, too. She's got the most amazing brown eyes, and they could \r\nmelt me every time. And I just wanted to do something nice. ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? ",
        "Frank: I bought her the computer. And things were great at first. It gave us \r\nan excuse to hang out, brought us closer together. I felt -- I felt like a kid \r\nagain -- nervous, excited. I didn't know what I did to deserve her. ",
        "Kevin: Tell me more about what her face looks like. ",
        "Frank: She has these beautiful, full lips, high cheek bones, and the most \r\nincredible smile. I missed that face when she was in Tennessee. ",
        "Kevin: But she came back? ",
        "Frank: Mm-hmm. And things were great until I almost blew it. But she gave me \r\nanother chance, and I didn't think anything could ever come between us again.\r\n",
        "Frank: Then I ruined everything. She can't be gone. ",
        "Kevin: You said her hair is -- ",
        "Frank: Shoulder length. ",
        "Kevin: She look anything like this? ",
        "",
        "Joe: B.P.'s 120/76. ",
        "Chris: And her saturation's staying at 95% on 15 liters. ",
        "Ian: It means we don't have to intubate. ",
        "Chris: Ok. Eve, could you see if Colleen has those blood results back, \r\nplease? ",
        "Eve: Ahem, yeah. ",
        "Chris: Ian, let's lower the oxygen to 12 liters, please. ",
        "Colleen: Are you all right? ",
        "Eve: Yes, I'm fine. ",
        "Colleen: I have Ms. Wexler's blood results. Take a look at that blood type. \r\nAB-neg. ",
        "Eve: Oh, God, AB-neg. That's the same as Arianna. ",
        "Colleen: Yeah. I heard that Rhonda's awake, so I'm going to go in and ask if \r\nwe can run some donor tests. There's a chance -- ",
        "Eve: That's right. Oh, my God. There's a chance Rhonda Wexler could be a \r\nmatch for Arianna. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Granny, I think it's -- I think it's great that you're out of the \r\nhospital and everything, but don't you think it's a little soon for you to be, \r\nyou know, up and out on the town? ",
        "Amanda: Well, thank you for your concern, Jamal, but I'm fine. ",
        "Jack: Whoa, you know, Alison's a little busy right now. It's really not a \r\ngood time. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, it's not. It's not. ",
        "Amanda: Excuse me, but I'm sure my granddaughter will make time for me. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Alison: Nana! You're out of the hospital! ",
        "Amanda: Hello, darling. ",
        "Alison: Hi. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ah. Man! Jack, look, I got to go, man. You got to make sure they don't \r\ntalk about the 25 Gs. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I know, all right? Don't worry. Good luck tonight. ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. ",
        "Jack: Oh, boy. ",
        "Alison: You look great. ",
        "Amanda: Oh, darling, and you don't look busy. ",
        "Alison: Who said that I was? ",
        "Amanda: Oh, never mind. I came to thank you for being so attentive to me \r\nduring my recovery. I can't tell you how much it meant to me. Oh, I've waited so \r\nlong for us to be close again. I missed you. ",
        "Alison: Me, too, Nana. ",
        "Amanda: Oh. You've done an amazing job with this place. And it doesn't smell \r\nlike a bike shop. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that's Alison's cooking. She is an incredible cook and it's \r\nbringing in so much business, too. ",
        "Amanda: Oh, well, I'm not surprised. ",
        "Alison: But, really, we -- we couldn't have fixed this place up without you, \r\nNana. ",
        "Jack: Oh, my gosh. You look so tired, Mrs. Barrington. Maybe I should drive \r\nyou home. ",
        "Livvie: Jack! ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Livvie: Come on, Alison wants to spend time with her grandmother, so chill, \r\nok? ",
        "Amanda: Why, thank you, young lady. And as for you, Chandler, I think \"chill\" \r\nsays it perfectly. I never felt better in my life. Nor have I ever been more \r\nproud of you, darling -- making this place such a success and on your own. ",
        "Alison: Nana, you can stop acting so innocent. I know that the $25,000 came \r\nfrom you. ",
        "Amanda: What? ",
        "Jack: Alison, I think something's burning. ",
        "Livvie: Jack! ",
        "Alison: Um -- you know, the -- the post office box and the bag of money that \r\nyou put there for me ring any bells? ",
        "Amanda: Alison, darling, I would never put money in a post office box. And I \r\ntook it very seriously when you told me not to interfere with your business. ",
        "Alison: But the money, it -- ",
        "Amanda: Wherever it came from, I assure you I had nothing to do with it. ",
        "",
        "Frank: This sketch you drew looks exactly like Karen. You must remember her. \r\nKevin, she was a doctor at G.H. She was Eve's best friend. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, Frank, I don't. ",
        "Frank: But this is her! You couldn't have drawn this if -- ",
        "Kevin: Frank -- Frank. Rhonda Wexler says she does not have a daughter. No \r\none that you say knew Karen has ever even heard of her. Only you. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Rhonda gave her permission. It's just a matter of doing the screening.\r\n",
        "Eve: Good -- ahem. ",
        "Ian: Are you all right? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I'm fine. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Eve: Why wouldn't I be? ",
        "Ian: Well, it looked like you were going to pass out earlier, that's all. ",
        "Eve: I've just been working a lot lately, that's all. ",
        "Ian: You sure? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I'm sure. Colleen, hi. What have you got for us? ",
        "Colleen: Blood type's the same, antigens are good. ",
        "Eve: Seven out of 10 markers match Arianna. ",
        "Ian: That's the best match yet. ",
        "Eve: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The alcohol poisoning \r\nwasn't a one-time deal for Rhonda. She's a habitual heavy drinker. ",
        "Ian: Could be liver damage. ",
        "Eve: Exactly. ",
        "Ian: Did you draw liver enzymes? ",
        "Colleen: Lab has the blood. I'll check how far along they are. ",
        "Ian: We only need a small part of the liver. ",
        "Eve: Right. And there's still a chance Rhonda could be the answer to our \r\nprayers. For Arianna. ",
        "Ian: For us.",
        "",
        "Amanda: I thought all that talk about a post office box was your way of \r\ntelling me not to be nosy. ",
        "Alison: Hmm, that's so weird. ",
        "Amanda: I was tempted to offer you a loan, but -- but meddling is what got us \r\ninto this estrangement in the first place, and I wouldn't think of doing that \r\nagain. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. You've been great, Nana. Um -- maybe you should have \r\nTerence take you home, you know, because you really do need your rest. ",
        "Amanda: All right, if you think so. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. ",
        "Amanda: Now, listen, you won't forget to come over for dinner again -- soon?\r\n",

        "Alison: What the hell is going on, Jack? ",
        "Jack: What makes you think I know? ",
        "Alison: Because you were obviously trying to get rid of Nana. You know where \r\nthe money came from. ",
        "Livvie: If you know, Jack, you have to tell her. ",
        "Alison: That's what all your conversations with Jamal have been about, \r\nhuddled up and whispering, isn't it? Oh, my God. Did Jamal do something bad to \r\nget that money? Is he in trouble? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: All right. Let's get this over with. ",
        "Sam: Come on, show a little excitement. ",
        "Zach: Yeah. You're racing again, man. ",
        "Jamal: No. After tonight, our deal stands. Our debts are clear and I never \r\nsee you punks again. ",

        "Kevin: How's everything else in your life? You ok? Look, I know you see a lot \r\nas a paramedic, Frank -- traumatic accidents -- ",
        "Frank: What's your point, Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: Why don't you come down to the hospital with me? ",
        "Frank: And what good would that do? ",
        "Kevin: Well, we could try to sort through all this. And I could call Victor, \r\nsee if we could set up a search. ",
        "Frank: Well, why? You don't believe she ever existed. ",
        "Kevin: But I want to help, Frank. Victor can go through national and \r\ninternational records if you want. In the meantime -- ",
        "Frank: You know, I am -- I am pretty tired, and if we try the search, at \r\nleast I'd be doing something. ",

        "Frank: Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: All right. ",
        "Kevin: See if you can find someone who's seen or even heard of a Dr. Karen \r\nWexler -- late twenties, apparently lived in Port Charles and supposedly Rhonda \r\nWexler's daughter. Yes, I know it sounds far-fetched, but Frank seems so \r\nconvinced, we have to at least check out the possibility. All right. I \r\nappreciate it, Victor, and tell Mary not to worry. We'll get Frank through this \r\nfine. Ok. I'll talk to you later. Frank, every -- Frank? ",

        "Ian: I've been thinking a lot about miracles lately. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, me, too. ",
        "Ian: And my sister Granya's been on my mind. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: And I was wondering what she might say. ",
        "Eve: And? ",
        "Ian: And I think she'll tell me to follow my heart. ",
        "Eve: I think that's very important. ",

        "Eve: Right, and you said that you wanted me not just for one night, but for \r\nalways. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I want a life with you -- children, growing old. Walks in the \r\npark -- you know, storybook stuff. ",
