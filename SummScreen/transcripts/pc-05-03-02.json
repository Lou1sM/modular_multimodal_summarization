        "Officer: Or in her apartment or at her grandmother's. ",
        "Mac: Well, she's in town somewhere. We know that much. ",
        "Doree: But where? ",
        "Mac: Check the hospital, all right? Check the barn. Meet me back at the unit \r\nASAP. ",
        "Doree: Yes, sir. ",

        "Lucy: Turn any one over. ",
        "Ian: Thornhart. ",
        "Mac: Ian, it's Mac. Look, but if Lucy's there, don't mention my name, will \r\nyou? ",
        "Ian: No problem. ",
        "Mac: The forensic results are back, and the blood we found on that sweater in \r\nthe trunk of the car? Alison Barrington's car? It's Kevin's. Ian? ",
        "Ian: I'm still here. ",
        "Mac: We have enough to arrest Alison for murder. ",
        "Ian: You do what you're doing there, and I'll -- I'll take care of things \r\nhere. ",
        "Mac: So you'll tell Lucy? ",

        "Jack: This is probably pretty bad. ",
        "Alison: That's ok. I don't really think that I'd be able to tell good from \r\nbad right now. I'm sure that I wouldn't be able to make any sort of a mocha or \r\nmuffin worth eating or drinking, that's -- ",
        "Jack: I think it's in your head, Alison. ",
        "Alison: Jack, I feel so far away from that girl that I once was, who made \r\nmuffins and lattes in the bike shop and stuff, you know? ",
        "Jack: No, no. That's not what I'm talking about. ",
        "Alison: Then what? ",
        "Jack: Rebecca. ",
        "Alison: Oh, so, then, Jamal told you. ",
        "Jack: You know, I mean, your great-great-great-grandmother doesn't really \r\ncome out of a portrait and talk to you. ",
        "Alison: Jack, I'm not making this up. Rebecca really does talk to me, and \r\nshe's real. And I think that she's the one person who knows why Kevin \r\ndisappeared. Why doesn't somebody believe me? ",
        "Jack: No, no, no -- ",
        "Alison: I keep on talking about this. I'm -- ",
        "Jack: No, listen -- no, Alison, listen to me, ok? I just don't think the cops \r\nwill. I'm not saying that I don't completely believe you. But maybe you \r\nshouldn't tell the cops -- ",
        "Alison: Don't you think I know this? Don't you think that I know how crazy \r\nthis sounds? But, still, it is the truth. I'm telling you. And if Rebecca's the \r\none person in the world who knows where Kevin is or somehow can help me find him \r\n-- ",
        "Jack: Alison, hold on. Listen to me. I'm on your side. ",

Just show me a \r\nlittle more, show me a little more. You can't leave it like this. Come on. Come \r\non. Come on, James! James, I know where you live! And I know how to get there. \r\nAll right! You want me to cross over to the dark again? Fine! I'm here! Come on, \r\nJames. Stop playing games, James! Show yourself! ",

        "Rafe: Help me. ",

        "James: Dear boy, expressions of violence do not contribute to a suitable \r\natmosphere! ",
        "Rafe: Fine! Then you tell me, kind sir, what is happening to Alison? ",
        "James: That's better! Well, I can tell you she's the picture of health -- \r\nthough she's been accused of murder. ",
        "Rafe: I still can't believe that they think she killed Kevin. ",
        "James: And she will likely be convicted. ",
        "Rafe: Where is she now? ",
        "James: As I told you, master Rafe, when you first crossed our threshold, I \r\ncan give you the answers to all of your questions. I can quench all of your \r\ndesires once we have established a business arrangement. ",
        "Rafe: Whoa -- whoa, whoa, whoa. I never said I'd sign that. ",
        "James: The papers are a mere formality. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but if I sign that -- ",
        "James: If you sign this, you'll have access to everything you could ever \r\npossibly want. ",
        "Rafe: All I want is to know that Alison's ok and that she will be ok. ",
        "James: Then sign this document and let's move on. We can get you back to \r\nearth, my fine, feathered friend, to be with your Alison, to defend her, to dry \r\nher eyes, to bring her joy. She'd be so grateful. Can't you just see her eyes, \r\nglistening with tears of relief and love? Well? Do you want it or not? ",
        "Rafe: Yes. ",
        "James: Ah. Oh, excellent. ",

        "James: I do admire your fortitude, master Rafe. In fact, I bow to you. ",
        "Rafe: You -- you do? ",

        "Alison: Livvie, you've got the wrong idea here. ",
        "Livvie: No, I don't think so, Alison. I knew you'd be here. That's why I came \r\nby to pick up the rest of my stuff. And I figured we could all sit down and \r\nmaybe get things out in the open. Jack, I hope you remembered to change the \r\nsheets. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, there's nothing going on with me and Alison, and you know it.\r\n",

You need to figure things out. But guess what, Jack -- you had \r\nyour time and now my father is dead! And you're just as responsible for it as \r\nAlison. What do you think about that, huh? ",
        "Jack: I think I don't recognize you anymore. ",
        "Livvie: Good, because then we're even because I don't know who you are, \r\neither. I've lost my dad, and all you care about is what's going to happen to \r\nAlison. So you know what? The two of you deserve each other. I can't believe \r\nyou're doing this to me, Jack. You can go to hell. ",
        "Livvie: You can all go to hell. ",
        "Jamal: Look, just hang in there, ok? It'll all work out. I promise. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: You can't have her soul. I won't let you. ",
        "James: Stuck up in the clouds, there's nothing much you can do. Now, if you \r\ncould somehow manage to get yourself back to earth -- ah, that would change \r\neverything. Oh, you could sweep up your Alison in your fairy-tale arms and ride \r\noff entwined into the sunset. And what wouldn't any true lover give for one \r\nperfect moment of bliss? ",
        "Rafe: I'd give anything. ",
        "James: Yes. And all that I'm asking for is one used soul. Oh, say yes and \r\nfree yourself of the tyranny of these -- these trifling emotions of mind and of \r\nwill. Say yes and I promise that you'll never -- you'll never miss them. There's \r\nonly one question that you have to ask here -- how much do you really love this \r\ngirl? When you answer that question, you'll know exactly what you have to \r\ndo. How much do you love -- ",
        "Rafe: Yes. ",
        "James: Yes? Be certain. Now, you must be certain. No refunds, no exchanges.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Yes. ",
        "James: \"Yes.\" Yes. Well, that's it, then, clever angel. You sign here, and I \r\npromise you all of your wishes, all of your dreams, your heart's desires, will \r\nall come true. Prove how much you love Alison. Prove it. ",

        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" -- ",
        "James: This is not a negotiation. ",
        "Rafe: That's exactly what it is. Now, shut up and listen. ",
        "Livvie: Alison's not going to get away with this, Jack. I'm going to make \r\nsure of that. But the only question is, are you with me on this or not? ",
