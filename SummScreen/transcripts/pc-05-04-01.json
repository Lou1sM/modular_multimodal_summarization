        "Livvie: Come on, Jack, out with it. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, the truth because you know that that money that I used to open \r\nup the cafe didn't come from Nana. ",
        "Jack: Girls, I don't know any more than you do. ",
        "Alison: Look, Jack, please, can you just imagine the thousands of ways that \r\nI'm coming up with for Jamal to have gotten that money? ",
        "Livvie: He told you not to say anything, didn't he? ",
        "Jack: I didn't say that. ",
        "Alison: Jamal's in trouble, isn't he? ",
        "Livvie: If something is going on, you have to tell us. ",
        "Jack: Like what? What do you want me to tell you? ",
        "Alison: Well, for starters, where he is. Where is Jamal? ",

        "Jamal: So which one of these guys I got to watch out for on the course? ",
        "Zach: Truth is none of them are in your league. ",
        "Sam: It's been a while since he's raced. ",
        "Jamal: Not that long. ",
        "Sam: Long enough to lose your edge. ",
        "Jamal: Look, why don't you let me worry about my edge? Yeah, you just hold up \r\nyour end of the deal and I'll do mine. ",
        "Zach: You win this race, and we'll all be happy. ",
        "Sam: And so proud of muffin boy. ",
        "Zach: Lay off, Sam. That's no way to welcome back a champ. ",
        "Jamal: I'm not \"back.\" I ride one, period. ",
        "Zach: Let's see how you feel when you come around the first few corners with \r\nthe pack behind you, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Zach, this is over. You got that? One night, one race, that's it. Do \r\nyou hear me, man? ",
        "Zach: Yeah, I hear you. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I win, I walk, and I never see you or your little spice girl \r\nagain. I'm going to check my bike. ",
        "Sam: Think our man's ready? ",
        "Zach: Yeah, he's fine for tonight. But down the road, he'll need a lesson on \r\nwho calls the shots. ",

        "Chris: Hi, this is Chris Miller, calling back Dr. Fransen about my wife's prenatal \r\nresults. Right. Right, yeah. Oh, that's great. That's just what we wanted to \r\nhear. Well -- yeah -- well, this baby means everything to her. ",
        "",
        "Ian: So what's going on? Why'd you want to come up here? ",
        "Eve: Look, I know there's a lot going on right now for both of us. ",
        "Ian: Well, that's an understatement. ",
        "Eve: Well, remember what we were talking about earlier? ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. The what ifs. ",
        "Eve: Right. What if Rhonda's liver panel comes back as a match for Arianna? \r\nAnd then what if Arianna gets the transplant and in time she recovers? And then \r\nin time, sooner or later, we'll be able to maybe start thinking about our future \r\ntogether and maybe even a family. ",
        "Elaine: Dr. Lambert? Dr. Lambert? ",
        "Eve: Yes? ",
        "Elaine: Dr. Quartermaine needs these all filled out and back on his desk by \r\ntomorrow. ",
        "Eve: Ahem. ",
        "Ian: Go on. ",
        "Eve: So -- ",
        "Deneice: Oh, excuse me. Marcela wanted me to tell you that the equipment for \r\nyour wife's home care, it's down in the E.R. So let me know when you're ready, \r\nand I'll help you take it out to your car. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Thank you. ",
        "Deneice: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: Ok, let's continue this in the on-call room. Come on. ",
        "Chris: Absolutely. I'll pass the news along to her. Thanks. All right, you \r\ntake care. Eve! Hey -- ",
        "Ian: Ramsey. Could we have a moment, please? ",
        "Chris: Eve? ",
        "Eve: Yeah, it's ok. ",
        "Colleen: Oh, good. Dr. Ramsey, these just came in. I think you should look at \r\nthem right away. You guys, too. ",
        "Ian: What are they? ",
        "Colleen: The results from Rhonda Wexler's liver panel. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Rhonda? Remember me? I'm Dr. Collins. I was wondering if I could ask \r\nyou a few questions. ",
        "Rhonda: About what? ",
        "Kevin: Well, about Frank Scanlon. He's disappeared again. ",
        "Rhonda: Good. Then he won't be poking around in my basement anymore. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if he shows up here to talk -- ",
        "Rhonda: He's nuts, you know. ",
        "Kevin: What I know is, is that he believes that he connected with you through \r\na computer -- ",
        "[Rhonda sighs] ",
        "Kevin: Only you were back in 1973, and he was -- ",
        "Rhonda: He's crazy, all right? He's absolutely crazy. Now, come on, leave me \r\nalone. ",
        "Kevin: He also says that you have a daughter. ",
        "Rhonda: Yeah, named Karen. He actually gave her a name. That's how sick the \r\nguy is. ",
        "Kevin: Rhonda -- ",
        "Rhonda: Get out of here! Gosh, what kind of doctor are you anyway? You're \r\nmaking me feel worse. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. That's not what I'm trying to do. ",
        "Rhonda: Don't you understand that the one thing I always wanted was a family? \r\nIt would've made my pathetic life better. Someone that I cared about and cared \r\nabout me. But I don't have any children, all right? I don't have a daughter \r\nnamed Karen. I wish to God I did, but I don't, all right? I just don't. ",
        "",
        "Frank's Voice: I bought an old computer. Somehow I connected to a girl named \r\nCookie, who was living in 1973. And it turns out, Cookie's Rhonda Wexler. \r\nAnyway, I told her not to go to a dance. She was going to meet a boy there. But \r\nI talked her out of going, and in the process, stopped the woman I love from \r\never being conceived. So Karen ceased to exist. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Describe her. Tell me what she looks like. ",
        "Frank: She -- she's beautiful. ",
        "Kevin: Her hair. What -- what color was it? ",
        "Frank: It's brown and thick. It's about down to here. Her eyes are brown, \r\ntoo. She's got the most amazing brown eyes. She has these full lips, high cheek \r\nbones, and the most incredible smile. She can't be gone. ",
        "Kevin: She look anything like this? ",
        "",
        "Mary: Well, where could Frank be? ",
        "Victor: He'll probably come walking through that door any minute now. ",
        "Joe: Actually, I think he might be a while. I think I talked Frank into \r\ngetting a quick checkup -- or at least going home to get some rest. ",
        "Mary: Well, you said he was upset about something, but you didn't say what. \r\nOk, now, tell me. What's going on? ",
        "Joe: Ok. Have you ever heard of a doctor at G.H. named Karen Wexler? ",
        "Mary: No. ",
        "Joe: Well, Frank's going around telling everybody that he's in love with her \r\nand that she's disappeared and he's got to find her and that we're all crazy for \r\nnot knowing who she is. ",
        "Mary: That doesn't make any sense. If there'd been a doctor at G.H. by that \r\nname, we'd know her, especially if Frank was involved with her. ",
        "Victor: Sweetheart, we're going to figure out what's happening here. Don't \r\nworry.",
        "Joe: We'll find Frank.",

        "",
        "Ian: Well, what is it? What's the condition of Rhonda's liver? ",
        "Chris: Cirrhosis. There's too much damage. Rhonda's on borrowed time herself.\r\n",
        "Ian: No family? No brothers or sisters? ",
        "Chris: Nothing. I already checked. I'm sorry. ",
        "Ian: Ok, that's that, then. ",
        "Eve: Thanks for trying, Chris. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. I hope you have some better news for me. ",
        "Eve: Uh -- I was going to tell you that Rhonda had been a patient of mine \r\nlast year and we checked her for liver damage then, but it was too severe this \r\ntime around, I guess. I'm sorry. ",
        "Ian: It's -- it's all right. I -- I got caught hoping, as well. Hmm. Ok. I \r\nshould go check on Arianna. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Give her my best, please. Ian, I'm thinking about her. All the time.\r\n",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Chris: You were going to tell him, weren't you? ",
        "Eve: You heard him. Nothing has changed. Arianna is still his top priority.\r\n",
        "Chris: What about yours? ",
        "Eve: Well, I've been trying not to think about that. But I guess the time has \r\ncome. I have a big decision to make. Big life decision, starting now. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I don't mean to upset you. Actually, I came here to warn you, Rhonda. \r\nNo one knows where Frank is and he could show up here any time. ",
        "Rhonda: I already told him everything -- ",
        "Kevin: We've all told him. Frank believes you have a daughter. ",
        "Rhonda: But he's wrong, all right? I don't want to talk to him anymore and I \r\ndon't want to talk to you. Just leave me alone. ",

        "Ian: Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Rhonda's test results? ",
        "Ian: She can't be a donor. ",
        "Kevin: Don't tell me. Too much liver damage. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Did I hear you say that she has a daughter? ",
        "Kevin: Well, Frank Scanlon thinks so. ",
        "Ian: Any truth in it? ",
        "Kevin: All I can tell you is Frank is looking for a woman that he claims to \r\nbe in love with and she's named Karen Wexler. ",
        "Ian: Who he thinks is Rhonda's daughter? ",
        "Kevin: Who he also says is a doctor in this hospital. Meanwhile, no one's \r\never even heard of the woman. ",
        "Ian: I would give anything to find a relative of Rhonda's. Because if she's a \r\nmatch, chances are a blood relation would be also. ",
        "Kevin: And a donor is your only way of saving Arianna, then? ",

        "Alison: Jack, I'm going to kill you if you don't just tell me exactly what is \r\ngoing on. ",
        "Livvie: Alison, Alison, hold on, wait a minute. ",
        "Jack: Look, Livvie, I can't tell you, either. ",
        "Livvie: Well, why not? You promised him about Alison, but my name never came \r\nup. And we do not have any more secrets, Jack. You promised me, remember? ",
        "Man: Is there a mechanic around here? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Hey, what's up, man? ",
        "Man: My ride's dead and I got to get out to that race. Think you can look at \r\nit? ",
        "Alison: Race? Wait, what race? ",
        "Man: It's -- check it out. I'm surprised you're not out there. ",
        "Jack: Uh, yeah, let's check it out out back. ",
        "Alison: Wait -- wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Jack? Uh, no, get in here. I \r\nknow who this is. This is Sam, your old pal cycle slut, all right? Remember, the \r\none who tried to run me down? ",
        "Jack: Alison, Alison, just listen to me, all right? ",

        "Jack: Yes. ",
        "Alison: But he said that they were dangerous. ",
        "Jack: Alison, if you want to know, you're going to have to ask Jamal. All \r\nright? He'll have to tell you. ",

        "Chris: Are you sure you're in the right place -- right frame of mind for \r\nmaking big decisions? ",
        "Eve: Look, Ramsey, I'm going to start showing soon. How long can I stick \r\naround before people start to find out? ",
        "Chris: Meaning Ian. ",
        "Eve: Meaning I came this close to getting sick today. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, I know. In the E.R. -- I saw. ",
        "Eve: And before anybody else does, I have to think of a good reason to leave \r\ntown because there's no future here for Ian and me. ",
        "Chris: Doesn't mean that you have to pack up and go. ",
        "Eve: If he's still here, it does. I can't keep getting my hopes up. Every \r\ntime I even hear the slightest chance, there's the slightest possibility that \r\nRhonda could be a match for Arianna, I get my hopes up and then I start \r\ncelebrating. ",
        "Chris: I know. I know, all the ups and downs are probably making you pretty \r\ndizzy. ",
        "Eve: They're killing me. And hearing it again for the 10th time just makes \r\nthis 10 times harder than it did the last time. And if I'm going to have a \r\nchild, I want to make sure that my feet are planted firmly on the ground. My son \r\nor my daughter is not going to grow up the way I did. They are not going to grow \r\nup with a mother like mine, a mother who doesn't even have enough peace in her \r\nheart to put her child first. My baby is going to have a stable mom who is happy \r\nwith the choice she made. ",
        "Chris: You sound sure of yourself. ",
        "Eve: Well, it's not what I planned, but I can do it. I can be a good mom. ",
        "Chris: I know you can. ",
        "Eve: I am ready, I am strong, and I have lots of love to give. My baby can \r\nhave a wonderful life -- even if I have to do it all by myself. I will make that \r\nmy choice -- even if I don't have one. ",
        "Chris: Look, what if I told you that you do? ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Chris: Have a choice. I mean, another choice. There may be an option that you \r\nhaven't considered yet. ",

        "Kevin: I wish there was. What about Neil? Has anyone checked in to see if \r\nhe's heard any of this -- ",
        "Joe: He's in Europe with Courtney. ",
        "Mary: Thank goodness. ",
        "Kevin: Good. ",
        "Mary: But, now, Kevin, couldn't there actually be somebody named Karen \r\nWexler? ",
        "Joe: Mom -- ",
        "Mary: Well, maybe she just lives someplace else. Or maybe she really is \r\nRhonda's daughter. Or maybe it's one of those computer romances everybody's \r\ntalking about. ",
        "Joe: It's a big bunch of maybes, Mom. ",
        "Mary: So? Maybes happen. ",
        "Kevin: Victor, have you heard anything from your friends at the agency? ",
        "Victor: I could call them back. That's a good idea, Monk. They've had enough \r\ntime to run down any leads they've uncovered. ",

        "Frank: Fine. You go hold Arianna's hand. One of the reasons Karen wanted to \r\nbe a donor was to help you and Eve get back together. She believed in your love, \r\nIan. She believed you meant it when you said you weren't going to love Eve for \r\njust one night, but for always. ",
