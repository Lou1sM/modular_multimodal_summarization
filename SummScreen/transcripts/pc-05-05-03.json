        "Caleb takes Olivia home to his loft. She's still upset about her poisoned fangs. She thinks that they can never make love, but Caleb wants her to take the risk. He carries her to bed and talks her through the urge to bite him. Although her fangs do come out, with his help, she fights the need to feed on him. Caleb is confident that Joshua has an antidote to the poison, and he has a plan for how to get hold of it. At Elixir, Joshua gives Kevin a fresh supply of the drug that controls him. Elizabeth goes to the club, angry with Joshua for summoning her in the middle of the night. Informing her of his intention to make Alison his bride, Joshua asks Elizabeth to ease her daughter into her new life. Elizabeth refuses, offering herself instead, but Joshua convinces her that it's in her best interest to cooperate. While they talk, Kevin sketches Elizabeth. Alison and Rafe go to the airport and wait for Flight 1512. Rafe has a dream or vision of Alison as Joshua's vampire bride, and it scares him. Sensing Frank nearby, Rafe takes Alison to get in line to board the flight. By the time Frank finds them, they've pulled a switch. Ian and Lucy are disguised as their friends. Alison and Rafe arrive at Caleb's old hideout in the catacombs, where they plan to hide from Joshua and his goons."

        "Caleb: Hey. it's going to be all right.",
        "Livvie: All right? I just killed a man. My fangs are poisoned. I can't turn you back, and I can't make love to you the way I want to.",
        "Caleb: Not yet.",
        "Livvie: If I hadn't lost your ring --",
        "Caleb: You didn't lose it. Joshua took it.",
        "Livvie: And now he has everything he wants. All of its powers, everything he needs.",
        "Caleb: He doesn't have you.",
        "Livvie: Neither do you. Not the way you want.",
        "Caleb: Hey. Does it matter? I love you.",
        "Livvie: And I love you. I just -- I can't -- I can't be with you, knowing what my bite might do to you.",
        "Caleb: I still want you.",
        "Livvie: I Can't. Caleb, I'm afraid.",
        "Caleb: Take the risk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Bring that in closer. You, pace yourself. Find a place to put those. Hurry up with that. I have a club to open. Ah. I see you've got a head start on the bar.",
        "Kevin: Just another liquid dinner, thank you.",
        "Joshua: I hope you left a little room for dessert.",
        "Kevin: I always do.",
        "Joshua: I had this concocted with you in mind. Go on, you can open it.",
        "Kevin: Oh. My new daily ritual.",
        "Joshua: 10 cc's just before bedtime or anytime you like.",
        "Kevin: You know, I have to admit, it's rather nice relinquishing my worries for a change, letting you make all the decisions.",
        "Joshua: I knew you'd see things my way, Dr. Collins.",
        "Elizabeth: Joshua.",
        "Joshua: Elizabeth -- it's always lovely to hear that voice.",
        "Elizabeth: You call me in the middle of the night, get me out of bed to come to this mess. What do you want besides my decorating skills?",
        "Joshua: Excuse me, Dr. Collins.",
        "Elizabeth: Boy, I tell you, this better be good because I swear --",
        "Joshua: It's about your daughter.",

        "Joshua: I want her.",
        "Elizabeth: What do -- what do you mean you want her?",

        "Elizabeth: No. No. No, you won't.",
        "Joshua: Yes, I will.",
        "Elizabeth: No, you know, I don't believe you. You know why? Because if you were really going to do that, you wouldn't tell me.",
        "Joshua: Just because I'm a vampire doesn't mean I'm not a gentleman, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Wait, wait -- what do you mean?",
        "Joshua: I think Alison probably will have some resistance for the plans I'm making about her life.",
        "Elizabeth: Are you -- what, you expect me --",
        "Joshua: I'm expecting you to help your daughter -- yes, of course I am.",
        "Elizabeth: I will do no such thing. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go get Rafe.",
        "Joshua: No, you're too late for that. What you are going to do is ease Alison into her new lifestyle as my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You ok?",
        "Alison: Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm just -- I'll feel a lot better when all this is over with.",
        "Rafe: Just hang tight. We'll be there soon. Hi.",
        "Ticket agent: Hello.",
        "Rafe: Uh -- Rafe Kovich, flight51512.",
        "Ticket agent: Mr. Kovich, you're flying with --",
        "Alison: Alison Barrington.",
        "Ticket agent: One moment, please.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Ticket agent: Ok. Boarding begins in just a few minutes.",
        "Rafe: Thank you. Beautiful.",
        "Alison: Thank you. Look, are you sure that we can do this?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You don't want to leave your family, right?",
        "Alison: No, I don't -- but my friends, too.",
        "Rafe: You -- here's the thing -- Joshua wants to take you for his bride, so I really don't think there's much of a choice.",
        "Alison: I know. I just -- Rafe, I think this is a little extreme, that's all.",
        "Rafe: Ok, I know. And all I care about is keeping you safe. I want to keep you away from Joshua and all his goons. In a little bit, you will be, ok?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: You'll be safe.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Trust how you feel.",
        "Livvie: The more I feel your lips on mine and your hands touching me, the more I want you.",
        "Caleb: Yes.",
        "Livvie: But we will have to stop just when the thing I want the most is to bite you.",
        "Caleb: And I'm telling you, it'll be ok. Just let go.",
        "Livvie: Wait, wait, wait, wait. If I bite you --",
        "Caleb: You won't.",
        "Livvie: But how?",
        "Caleb: I'll teach you.",
        "Livvie: No. What if I can't learn? What if I can't stop?",
        "Caleb: You can. You won't hurt me. I promise you.",
        "Livvie: But I'm still so scared.",

        "Kevin: Elizabeth. [Kevin As Joshua] Elizabeth. The curve of your neck, the line of -- [Kevin's Normal voice] Well, something about you anyway.",
        "Elizabeth: So I was right. You want Alison for your bride? What do you -- do you think I'm just going to stand by and let you destroy her life? Do you think Rafe will?",
        "Joshua: Do you ever listen to me? Rafe won't know what him, and Alison will be brought to me.",
        "Elizabeth: No, she won't. I will stop you. There is no way that I'm going to let my daughter suffer the kind of nightmare that I lived. I will kill you before you are even that close to turning her.",
        "Joshua: Oh, bravo, my dear. Bravo. What a wonderful, rousing speech. Just how do you intend to follow through on that threat?",
        "Elizabeth: Never underestimate the determination of a mother.",
        "Joshua: Or a vampire.",
        "Elizabeth: I will find a way. Believe me.",
        "Joshua: I am trying to be nice to you.",
        "Elizabeth: You call this nice?",
        "Joshua: Are my eyes red? What I'm doing is giving you the opportunity to help Alison. I'm not naive. This will not be a simple transition for her. I think it'd be easier for her if someone she loves and trusts eases her into her new position, but I can see you, mommy dearest, are not prepared to be a supportive mother of the bride.",
        "Elizabeth: She loves Rafe. There is no way she's going to go off with you.",
        "Joshua: Your point being?",
        "Elizabeth: You know, this doesn't make any sense, ok? Why Alison? Why are you obsessed with making her your bride?",
        "Joshua: Because I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: We'll make it out of here. I promise. I'm never going to let Joshua get to you. Never.",
        "Rafe's voice: It's Joshua's vision -- a city of tortured souls, a master vampire race, and his vampire bride. He wants Alison.",
        "Rafe: I will never let that happen. Alison? My God. Alison! Why can't you hear me? I can't move. Alison? Look at me. It's me. Why can't I move? Joshua.",
        "Joshua: Welcome to your wedding, Alison, the day you've always dreamed about.",
        "Rafe: No.",
        "Joshua: No one can stop us now.",
        "Rafe: Alison? Alison, you have to fight this. No -- no. Don't you touch her. No, she will never love you, you monster!",
        "Joshua: You're mine now, Alison. My wife, forever.",
        "Rafe: No! No.",
        "Alison: Why? What's the matter? What is it?",
        "Rafe: No, it's ok. It's all right. Go back --",
        "Alison: Are you ok?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah. Oh. I will keep you safe, Alison. Till my last breath, I will keep you safe.",
        "Frank: You're close, slayer, I can feel it. But you won't be able to protect Alison much longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Just look in my eyes.",
        "Livvie: Yes.",
        "Caleb: Look in my eyes and then just let go. Let go. Trust. Believe. You don't need to feed.",
        "Livvie: I can't.",
        "Caleb: Come on.",
        "Caleb: Look at me. Look at me. Just let go. Focus on my eyes. Focus on how you feel. You see? You don't need to feed. You don't need to feed.",
        "Livvie: Caleb.",
        "Caleb: I knew you could do it.",
        "Livvie: I love you.",
        "Caleb: Shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, Joshua. You're going to have to do better than that. You won't just take Alison because you can.",
        "Joshua: Nonsense. She'll make a perfect bride for me.",
        "Elizabeth: But why?",
        "Joshua: She's beautiful, she's determined, she's strong, and she'll find a way to find love in this wretched soul.",
        "Elizabeth: You actually think you're going to get her to love you?",
        "Joshua: Yes. And she has a certain innocence I'm really looking forward to nurturing and molding.",
        "Elizabeth: And the fact that she happens to be the one true love of your sworn enemy has nothing to do with it?",
        "Joshua: Oh, all right. I do get a certain tingle when I think of stealing the slayer's intended but she also happens to be a Barrington, and that will make me more respectable. I mean, quite frankly, she has -- Alison has everything and pretty soon, she'll be mine.",
        "Elizabeth: No, please, Joshua, just don't do this.",
        "Joshua: I don't have time for this, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Listen, please. Oh, please, I'm begging you. Listen, if you want a Barrington, I'm a Barrington, so just take me instead.",
        "Joshua: Do you really think that's a fair exchange? Do you think when people see you coming, the word \"respectable\" comes to mind? No -- more like \"selfish,\" \"thoughtless\" --",
        "Elizabeth: Stop it.",
        "Joshua: \"Gold-digging hypocrite,\" \"change everywhere --\"",
        "Elizabeth: Do you have to be so cruel?",
        "Joshua: Because I don't have time for you. Now, either you get on my side and you help Alison so she's in a position to have all the money and all the power she'll ever want --",
        "Elizabeth: Or what?",
        "Joshua: Or you'll be out there fending for yourself in the world, lady -- no power, no privilege, no money. So what's it going to be? You tell me. Little old you out there on your own, fending for yourself. Not your strongest suit, now, is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: All right, slayer, let's wrap this up. If I'm lucky, you won't even see it coming.",
        "Rafe: Wait. There's something I feel.",
        "Alison: What? What is it?",
        "Rafe: Just get your stuff. Let's get going.",
        "Alison: What? Why?",
        "Rafe: Come on.",
        "Alison: Ok, ok. All right.",
        "Rafe: Don't look now, but I think we've got company.",
        "Alison: What? What do you mean? Is it -- is it Frank? Is it?",
        "Rafe: I don't think he sees us yet, ok?",
        "Alison: Are you sure? Are you sure that he can't see us?",
        "Rafe: Let's just keep moving.",
        "Alison: Ok, Rafe. Ok.",
        "Frank: Too late, Rafe. You won't get away this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I could've bitten you, Caleb. But somehow, I fought the feeling.",
        "Caleb: You just needed to trust yourself.",
        "Livvie: To know that we can be together.",
        "Caleb: It was so worth the risk. You know what?",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Caleb: You're amazing as ever.",
        "Livvie: I just wish we could get past this whole nightmare of having to worry every time we make love what my bite will do to you.",
        "Caleb: And I will never stop wanting that. To feel your teeth tear into my flesh and make me my true self.",
        "Livvie: Our true selves.",
        "Caleb: We will have that again. I promise. What? What are you thinking?",
        "Livvie: Nothing. It's just it wasn't that long ago and I thought we had everything. And even now, we can't be together, not the way we planned.",
        "Caleb: We're still ok.",
        "Livvie: I'm still afraid that this won't always be enough for you.",
        "Caleb: Do I seem disappointed?",
        "Livvie: Not now, but sooner or later.",
        "Caleb: You will sink your fangs into my flesh someday soon.",
        "Livvie: How?",
        "Caleb: Joshua would never create a poison without an antidote.",
        "Livvie: How could you be so sure?",
        "Caleb: I know him.",
        "Livvie: You -- you have a plan, don't you?",
        "Caleb: I have a plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: There. That ought to do it. Not bad. Not my best, either, but not bad at all. Almost perfect.",
        "Joshua: Well, what's it going to be? I'm still waiting.",
        "Elizabeth: You just better keep waiting.",
        "Joshua: No, time is up. Besides, I know that look, that \"slap me, push me, or I'll walk out the door\" look.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, you have no idea how much I'd love to do that.",
        "Joshua: Yeah, but we both know you're not going to do it, don't we? Because you're too busy figuring out which road to take. But at the end of the day, we both know that both roads lead Alison right back to Joshua. There. Got it all figured out, now, have we? Good girl. That wasn't so hard. Well, you've made the right decision. Just say it. Say it.",
        "Elizabeth: Damn you.",
        "Joshua: Well, that's the good news. I'm always so grateful to you, Elizabeth. You're always so kind. You always meet my lowest expectations. Do you care to celebrate?",
        "Elizabeth: Drink with you? No.",
        "Joshua: Well, then, I'll just have to toast myself. It's all going according to plan everything is falling into place. Frank will have the blushing bride here and mommy dearest, she will be wailing right by her side on her wedding day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Game's over. It's time for Joshua to have his wedding. Don't try to fight it, Alison. You're coming with me.",
        "Lucy: Hello, frank.",
        "Frank: Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Uh -- don't -- don't tell me. You weren't really going to try and kidnap my good friend Alison, were you?",
        "Ian: Because that'd be pretty stupid.",
        "Frank: Ian --",
        "Ian: You're going to have to tell your -- your big, powerful boss that your mission didn't work.",
        "Frank: You're going to pay for this, Thornhart. You are both going to pay.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Ta, little Frank. Ta-ta.",
        "[Lucy gasps]",
        "Lucy: We did it!",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Lucy: We did it, we did it, we did it! Ah, this is so fun!",
        "Ian: Let's just hope they stay safe.",
        "Lucy: Right. Hey -- score one for the good guys?",
        "[Lucy laughs]",

        "Alison: I cannot believe it. I never thought I would ever see this place again.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it's perfect.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it might be perfect, but it's really creepy. Hiding out in Caleb's old hangout?",
        "Rafe: Exactly why Joshua and his goons would never think to look for us here, huh?",
        "Alison: I wonder if he left anything like scary or trippy here.",
        "Rafe: Hey, you know what? It's going to be ok, all right? I got your back.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, you do.",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I cannot believe it. We actually got away. God, we did it.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, with a little help from our friends, huh?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah. Are you sure that nobody's going to find us here?",
        "Rafe: I just want to keep you as far away from that maniac as possible. Deal?",
        "Alison: Deal.",
        "Rafe: Whatever it takes to keep you safe. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire.\"",
