        "Rafe uses magic, imagination, and love to help Alison cope with being in the catacombs. Joshua prepares the villa for the arrival of his bride-to-be, Alison. He's quite impressed with Kevin's new painting, which depicts the happy couple on their wedding day. Although Caleb wishes he could think of another way to get the antidote, he and Olivia agree to put his plan into action. Mary admits that life after the Recovery Room isn't as she had hoped, but she's glad that Victor is happy with his new job. After making love, Rafe goes outside to check on things and comes face to face with Caleb. Alison opens her eyes to see Olivia looking at her. Lucy goes to the church to pray for her loved ones and for the town she calls \"home.\" Excited about his first official act as building commissioner, Victor shocks Ian and Lucy with his plans for the church. Olivia barges into the villa to show Joshua a horrifying photo of Alison, whom she claims to have bitten and killed with her poisoned fangs."

        "Ian: Will you look at that. You're looking especially lovely.",
        "Lucy: You look pretty lovely yourself, thank you.",
        "Ian: Yeah, you like this old sweater? Thank you very much. Are you ready?",
        "Lucy: No. But you think I need these tests, you want me to take those tests, so I'm going to go take those tests for you.",
        "Ian: What's that? I'll hold your hand. It won't hurt. It'll be all right.",
        "Lucy: No. I need to go do this alone.",
        "Ian: What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: I'm talking about, you know, when I go with you, you're a doctor. Everybody takes pity. You know, they make a big deal out of everything. I don't want all that attention.",
        "Ian: Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I'm fine. You know what? I -- I -- I really need to do this. So, hey, I'm doing you a favor so you do me a favor and let me do this alone.",
        "Ian: And there's no way I can change your mind, I guess?",
        "Lucy: No. But, you -- I'm ok, I'm fine, and I really -- I do not want you to worry.",
        "Ian: I always worry about you. It's my job.",
        "Lucy: I know. Hey, but after the hospital, see, I thought maybe I would just stop by this. There's a three-day sale at Wyndhamere -- I know! -- And you know shopping always makes me feel better, and besides, I don't picture you, my gorgeous, wonderful man, fighting some woman, you know, to go and get that last sundress in toddler size four.",
        "Ian: I'd do it.",
        "Lucy: I know, but don't. It'd be ugly.",
        "Ian: If you don't feel up to it, then I --",
        "Lucy: I know. I'll call you later.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",

        "[Joshua hums]",
        "Joshua: No, no, not there, not there. Not so close to the window. A little further. That's fine, down there. Right. If you were a beautiful young woman, would you want your chaise to be so close to the window and let the hot day sunlight beating down on you? I don't think so. Thank you. Put that back in place.",
        "Caleb: The thing is I deliver Alison to you, you give me the antidote for Olivia.",
        "Joshua: You bring me Alison Barrington, willing and able to be my bride.",
        "Caleb: Then we have a deal?",
        "Joshua: Not for my Alison. Not for my bride. Everything is going to be perfection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You know, if you keep walking back and forth like that, you're going to run a whole new tunnel into the ground.",
        "Alison: I can't help it. I just -- it's cold in here, and it stinks. And I figured maybe if I just keep on pacing back and forth, then I don't really have to think about the fact that we are in Caleb's old home.",
        "Rafe: Wait a second.",
        "Alison: It's so gross.",
        "Rafe: That's what I'm explaining to you, that's what I'm telling you, that that's why this is so perfect. Nobody's going to look for you here, all right, and you're safe. That's all that matters.",
        "Alison: I don't suppose maybe you would consider just packing up this little camping spree and going home?",
        "Rafe: Yes! Yes! That's exactly what we're going to do, once we defeat Joshua and make sure you are totally out of danger. Ok?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: If you have any doubts, now's the time to speak.",
        "Livie: I don't. It's just a little scary, that's all.",
        "Caleb: I wish there was another way, but I promised Joshua I'd deliver Alison to him.",
        "Livvie: I know. It's worth the risk if it buys us the antidote to the poison he's poisoned my fangs with.",
        "Caleb: It's the only way.",
        "Livvie: Ok, so what are we waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: There's my beautiful bride!",
        "Mary: Victor! What's wrong?",
        "Victor: Nothing's wrong, sweetheart, except you left the house without your lunch.",
        "Mary: Oh. Darling, you didn't have to come all the way over here.",
        "Victor: Well, I can't have my girl going hungry. Here.",
        "Mary: That's so sweet. You know, all these years, with the Recovery Room right across the street, I never had to think about bringing a brown bag for work.",
        "Victor: Part of life's rich, new adventure. Besides, we're welcome at the restaurant anytime. The new owner is having a lifetime pass prepared for us.",
        "Mary: Hmm. You know, I must confess, I'm not too thrilled with the things, the changes he's made. I think I'll stick with the hospital cafeteria.",
        "Victor: Sweetheart, you have to keep your eye on the big picture -- eyes on the prize. Mr. Joshua Temple has very big plans for Port Charles. The recovery room is just a very small step.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hi I know you're probably kind of surprised to see me here. Not that I don't love it in here. It's really beautiful. It's lovely. You know -- well, you know, I usually talk to you on my own terms, you know, down at the waterfront or in the park or under the stars. I'm not sure why. I think I guess I always figure that it matters what I believe in my heart, not where I am or what I want to call it or put a name to anything, you know. It's just lately that hasn't been working very well for me. So I don't know, I just thought maybe I'd try something a little more formal, like this, because I am -- I'm at a loss here. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. So I could really, really use help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I just sort of feel like the walls are starting to close in on me, you know?",
        "Rafe: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Never knew you to be claustrophobic. As a matter of fact, I think I recall a few days we spent together on a little train car. You didn't seem to be too upset with that, huh?",
        "Alison: Well, that was very different. It was under very different circumstances, too. I mean, we were going forward, we were going somewhere, and there were windows, lots of windows. It's a very different situation, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. That's true, yeah.",
        "Alison: And plus, this place doesn't really rank very high on my list of romantic spots for the one that you love.",
        "Rafe: You know what? It all depends on how you look at it.",
        "Alison: Ok, I'll buy that. Maybe I will try and look past the fact that it's very dark in here, it's rodent-infested, there's probably more insects in here than I can even count, and the stench, the fragrance is so overwhelming.",
        "Rafe: And look on the bright side.",
        "Alison: Wow. Rafe Kovich. You always have known how to brighten up a room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Classical music plays]",
        "Joshua: Be careful with that. That is the grand prize. Put it beside that other painting. There. Right over there. Now go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: There. Right over there. You see that?",
        "Alison: Oh, the -- the picture window?",
        "Rafe: Yes.",
        "Alison: Right. Ok, and what do we see out of the picture window?",
        "Rafe: What do you want to see?",
        "Alison: Well -- no. I'll take -- I'll take the ocean.",
        "Rafe: Hmm.",
        "Alison: I would love to see the ocean and the water glistening in the sun, with the whitecaps just sort of breaking on the shore as they hit. Is that ok? Can I choose that?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it's your window. You know, it's beautiful.",
        "Alison: I love that response. Ok, so when I open the window, I smell the fresh air -- oh -- and it grazes past my face, kind of flows through my hair. And it's so pretty. Can I choose that?",
        "Rafe: How about some dolphins?",
        "Alison: Oh, of course there's dolphins. There's always dolphins. There's schools of them.",
        "Rafe: Yes.",
        "Alison: I suppose we really can create our own magic now, can't we?",
        "Rafe: Yep. Oh! Oh! You didn't even notice.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: Well, picnic lunch.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I mean, I made some roast chicken and corn on the cob and some baked fresh bread. And did it myself. Didn't need your help --",
        "Alison: Oh, good!",
        "Rafe: You little baker girl.",
        "Alison: Very nice. And for dessert, my very favorite -- you.",
        "Rafe: Me?",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Rafe: Maybe we should make a toast.",
        "Alison: With the champagne that you brought, the beautiful bottle, right?",
        "Rafe: Absolutely.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you're catching on.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Rafe: To --",
        "Alison: Ahem.",
        "Rafe: Walking together in the sunshine.",
        "Alison: I'll toast to that. To us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Classical music plays]",
        "Joshua: My dear Doctor Collins. You've outdone yourself this time. You have never looked more beautiful. And if you were happy on our wedding day, just you wait until our wedding night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You know, I was so upset about something earlier. And for the life of me, I just can't remember what it was.",
        "Rafe: No?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mary: Victor, whether or not I like what Mr. Temple's done with the Recovery Room isn't important. The thing is, I thought we sold the restaurant so that you'd have a break, and, darling, you look more stressed than ever.",
        "Victor: I do?",
        "Mary: Are you sure this new job isn't wearing you down?",
        "Victor: Oh, Mary, I love being building commissioner. I had no idea the job would be this exciting. It's as if I'm in the eye of the hurricane, everything's happening around me.",
        "Mary: Well, I want you to be happy. It's just that I thought once we unloaded that financial burden, we could maybe take a cruise, go to Europe --",
        "Victor: Oh, sweetheart --",
        "Mary: You know, things we dreamed about.",
        "Victor: I have wonderful memories of Europe, but that's what Europe is -- memories in the past. It's not alive and vital, the way we are now.",
        "Mary: Huh?",
        "Nurse: Mr. Collins?",
        "Victor: Yes.",
        "Nurse: Frank Scanlon called regarding the appointment you have at the commission.",
        "Victor: Oh, absolutely. Right. It's my first presentation. Very big doings, if my sources are correct.",
        "Mary: Well, they certainly chose the right man.",
        "Victor: Thank you. I've never been happier in my life. I feel as if I finally have the job that I've wanted. And as for you, my little chickadee, you're not to worry about me, about my health --",
        "Mary: Oh --",
        "Victor: About anything ever again!",
        "Mary: Well, you got it. Darling? Don't forget to take your vitamins.",
        "Victor: Oh. Well, let's make sure I have them. Yep, got everything I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I feel like this is my light, my home, you know, the constant, this town. I wanted so desperately to have somewhere to be from, somewhere to belong, somewhere I could say, \"this is mine and this is my home.\" But now I don't -- I don't know. I feel like I can't even recognize this place anymore. I mean, I see it, I see the landmarks, I see General Hospital and the docks and the waterfront and the park and schools and this place. And I'm so afraid. It's like they're rotting from inside. Even the Recovery Room. I take Serena there. My girls go there. Frank and Victor sneak them cookies when I'm not looking. I had Christina's birthday party there, for God's sakes. Do you know what Victor and Frank have become? Do -- of course you do. Oh. Look, you know, usually when I talk to you, it's about me -- me and more of me. But that's not why I'm here. I really am here about other people for once, huh? See, I know that if you think that it's my time to die -- I've said it out loud, didn't I? If it is my time to die, I know that there's not a whole heck of a lot I can do about that, and I tell you what, though, I'm not going down without a fight. I have two beautiful daughters who I think really need their mom. It'd make it hard on them if I wasn't here for them. And I have the most amazing man who loves me very much, and I love him. He's my strength and he's my hope and he's my future, and I'm certainly not ready to leave him. But if I have to, if you can't fix what's broken in me, then please, please fix what's broken here in my home, because I need to know that the people I love can live out their lives in peace.",
        "Ian: Lucy.",
        "Ian: I swear with everything that is left in me that I will not let you die.",
        "Lucy: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe?",
        "Livvie: Rise and shine, Alison. It's time to say goodbye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I'm so -- I'm so very sorry.",
        "Ian: You have nothing to apologize for.",
        "Lucy: I do. I don't want you to have to go through this with me, and I didn't tell you last night how scared I was. I'm sorry I couldn't. I just didn't know how.",
        "Ian: I know.",
        "Lucy: I don't want to leave you. And I don't -- I don't want to die.",
        "Ian: Then you won't, because we're going to work day and night and make you better. I promise.",
        "Victor: Lucy. Ian. I didn't expect to see -- will you just look at -- this is perfect!",
        "Lucy: Victor, what -- what are you talking about?",
        "Victor: I'm talking about this place. Look, look at the simplicity, the bare bones of the building. It is going to be so easy to do this that I'm filled with goose bumps.",
        "Lucy: Well, that's swell. Of course this is a great place. I mean, this is the church. Our founders worshipped here. This is the original thing.",
        "Victor: And it will be so easy to move from the past to the future. My first official act as building commissioner. This wonderful property is now in Joshua's hands.",
        "Ian: What?",
        "Victor: And as always, it will play a significant role in the life of the town, but the town of the future. Port Charles of the future. Voila!",
        "Ian: This is blasphemous.",
        "Victor: It's brilliant!",
        "Lucy: This isn't going to happen. It simply won't happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Kevin, you've been such a well-behaved little painter/doctor. As a reward for following my directions so well, I think I'll give you a little extra dose of your medicine this week.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Nice painting. What dream world are you living in?",
        "Joshua: Livvie. You're the last person I expected to see here. You haven't got enough of this place?",
        "Livie: I thought I might be missing something worthwhile. Uh -- apparently, as delusional as ever.",
        "Joshua: Don't be so sure, Livie. Just because I let you walk out of here intact didn't mean I didn't leave myself with room to dream.",
        "Livvie: \"Intact\"? Aren't you forgetting about that little special goodbye gift you gave me?",
        "Joshua: Ah, yes, the poison fangs. How is that going?",
        "Livvie: Well, Caleb didn't believe me at first. He wanted me to bite him anyway. But I wouldn't take that risk.",
        "Joshua: Always the sensitive one.",
        "Livvie: Huh. Not that sensitive. Ahem. A pretty good photographer, don't you think?",
        "Joshua: What is this?",
        "Livvie: Take a look.",
        "Joshua: No.",
        "Livvie: You aren't lying, Joshua. These suckers are pretty deadly.",
        "Joshua: Alison.",
        "Livvie: Yes. It's my own personalized wedding gift to you -- a dead bride. You can thank me later. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Elizabeth: We have a lot to offer each other.",
        "Kevin: I couldn't agree more.",
        "Livvie: You can sic any one of your vampires on me and I will take them out until you are the king of nothing.",
        "Lucy: If you want me, you're going to have to take the whole church."
