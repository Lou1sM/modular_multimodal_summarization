        "Chris' Voice: You have a second chance here, Eve, to give a baby everything \r\nthat you've always hoped for -- a stable home with a mom and a dad. ",
        "[Wedding music plays] ",
        "Chris: You won't be sorry, Eve. I'll spend every waking moment making our \r\nlives perfect. No doubts, no regrets. ",
        "Eve: No regrets, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Well, then, let's make it official. Reverend? ",
        "Ian: Shall we begin? ",
        "Eve: No. ",
        "",
        "Mary: Well, someone should have heard from Frank by now. I mean, we should \r\nhave stayed in the Recovery Room and waited for him. ",
        "Victor: Bob will let us know if he comes by. ",
        "Gabriela: More than likely he'll turn up back here soon. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, that makes perfect sense. ",
        "Mary: Oh, well, nothing makes sense. Suddenly Frank's obsessed with somebody \r\nnamed Karen nobody's ever heard of. ",
        "Joe: No news so far. ",
        "Gabriela: Did you leave a message? ",
        "Joe: One with Emilio and one on Frank's cell phone. ",
        "Victor: All right, then we're doing everything we can do. ",
        "Gabriela: He's got to come home sometime. ",
        "Mary: Then what? Then we all jump on him like some ambush out of an old \r\nwestern? ",
        "Victor: Sweetheart, it's not an ambush. It's an intervention. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, and, you know, Doc is very good at ambushes. ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Interventions. ",
        "Kevin: And let's not make me out to be some sort of a miracle worker. Don't \r\nforget, I already scared Frank off once. He may not be willing to listen to me \r\nagain. ",
        "Joe: He may not be willing to listen to anybody. I'm afraid to say this, but \r\nI think Frank's losing it. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Any luck, chief? ",
        "Chief: They're gathering the items as we speak. It shouldn't be long before \r\nwe have what you need for your journey. ",
        "Frank: It's just incredible, the whole idea of going back in time. ",
        "Chief: Oh, it's dangerous, Mr. Scanlon. ",
        "Frank: I don't care. We're talking about Karen, putting the world back the \r\nway it was so she can exist again. ",
        "Chief: There are no guarantees. ",
        "Frank: I am just asking for a chance to go back and disable that computer so \r\nthere's a chance Karen can be here again. That is worth any risk. ",
        "Chief: When I give you the herb, you must focus on Karen with all of your \r\nwill. With your heart, most of all. It's your love for her that holds the power \r\nto transport you back to the time and place where you can undo what was done and \r\nmake Karen part of this world again. ",
        "Frank: It's just unbelievable. 1973 -- I'll actually be there and be able to \r\ntalk to people, interact with them. ",
        "Chief: Remember, the fewer you interact with, the better. The dangers are \r\nmany. ",
        "Ian: You're taking a journey to fix a mistake. Focus on that. ",
        "Chief: Now, you'll be tempted by many things, see much you'll wish to change, \r\nbut you must not. Do only what needs to be done to save Karen or you could \r\nchange everything, Frank, here, for everyone. Now, never forget that your \r\ntiniest move could alter history as we know it. ",
        "",
        "Mary: Joseph Scanlon! Don't you ever let me hear you talk that way about your \r\nbrother. ",
        "Joe: Look, Mom -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What -- what if -- Joe, come on. What if Frank \r\nis actually telling the truth? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm serious. Let's just think about it for a minute. Weird things \r\nhappen in the universe, things we can't explain. Miracles happen. All kinds of \r\nthings happen. What if Frank is actually on some incredible journey? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: What if -- ",
        "Mary: Well, why couldn't he be? ",
        "Victor: You know, she's right. I mean, anything's possible. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. What? What? I am just trying to help here. ",
        "Kevin: Don't. Not now, ok? ",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, think about it. What if there actually is a Karen Wexler, and \r\nwhat if Frank is really, truly connected with his past somehow? Eve did it, and \r\nIan did it, and they did it through that chief on the island. ",
        "Kevin: You made your point. ",
        "Lucy: You know, you didn't think Eve was crazy. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, if I thought it would do any good to talk about this here, I \r\nwould, but all we'd be doing is hurting people who are already suffering if we \r\nget into a discussion about it in front of Frank's family. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. You're right. You're right. I will zip it for now. And whether it \r\nmay or may not be true, I think it is and I think you need to kind of zip your \r\nnarrow-mindedness. ",
        "Kevin: If I were really that narrow-minded, I wouldn't be as crazy about the \r\nway your mind works, now, would I? ",
        "Lucy: So you're really kind of crazy about the way my mind works, huh? ",
        "Kevin: I'm with you, aren't I? ",
        "",
        "Frank: Can I ask you a question, chief? ",
        "Chief: Ask. And if you're lucky, I might have an answer. ",
        "Frank: What happens to me if this works? I mean, when -- when I go back to \r\n'73? ",
        "Chief: What becomes of your body? ",
        "Frank: Yes. ",
        "Ian: The shell remains here. You will look to this time like a man in a sleep \r\nfrom which no one can wake you. ",
        "Frank: A coma. ",
        "Chief: To unenlightened eyes. ",
        "Frank: Well, I've got a family full of those, God bless every one of them. \r\nBut Joe. Joe -- he won't stop running tests, Ian, if he sees me stretched out \r\nand stiff but still alive. ",
        "Ian: Well, that's why we've got to keep him and everyone else from finding \r\nout about this. You don't want to worry them. ",
        "Chief: Or them trying to counter the herb's effects. There's no telling what \r\ncould happen. ",
        "Ian: So maybe the safest place for you would be right here where the chief \r\nand I can keep an eye on you. ",
        "Frank: Well, right now, every single one of them thinks I'm completely nuts, \r\nso I'd better go over there, do some damage control. I'll come up with some kind \r\nof a story. I'll get them to buy it, and then I'll head back over here. ",
        "Ian: Frank -- ",
        "Frank: Ian, it's going to work. It has to. ",
        "Chief: We'll be ready. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Let's just hope we don't live to regret it. ",
        "",
        "Girl's Voice: And looky! ",
        "Eve's Voice: And there's -- look, oh, there's a little dolly, and there's an \r\nelephant there. How many giraffes are there? ",
        "Chris: I'm home! ",
        "Eve: Hi. ",
        "Chris: Hi. ",
        "Girl: Daddy! ",
        "Chris: Hey, there. How are you? How's my doctor-in-training, huh? You know, it \r\nwon't be long before the three of us are sharing a practice. ",
        "Eve: That's right. Hey, you should see the painting that someone drew today.\r\n",
        "Chris: Oh. Really? Can I see? Ok. ",
        "Eve: Why don't you go get it for Daddy, and then bring it back and show it to \r\nhim, ok? ",
        "Chris: Hurry up. Hey. By the way, I canceled Friday's appointments so we can \r\nboth make that recital. ",
        "Eve: Perfect. ",
        "Chris: There she is. Wow. ",
        "Eve: Uh-huh. ",
        "Chris: Would you look at that?",
        "Eve: I'm telling you. ",
        "Chris: You know, you have made me the proudest daddy in the whole wide world \r\nbecause you're the best finger-painter in the whole wide world and the moon and \r\nthe planet and the stars. Mmm! ",
        "Girl: Aren't you going to hug and kiss Mommy, too? ",
        "Chris: Well, of course. Of course I am. You know, there's plenty of hugs and \r\nkisses for everybody in this family. That's a great picture. ",
        "Eve: That could work. I could do that. Maybe. ",
        "",
        "Mary: You had us worried half to death. Where have you been? ",
        "Frank: I know. I'm sorry. I got all your messages. I just needed a little \r\ntime alone. ",
        "Joe: Well, you look a lot better. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, a good night's sleep and a long shower will do that. ",
        "Kevin: Are you trying to tell us you're feeling like a new man, Frank? ",
        "Frank: What I'm trying to tell you is how embarrassed I am about the way I've \r\nbeen acting -- running out on you the way I did, stirring up all kinds of \r\ntrouble. I will never work that many hours without a break again. ",
        "Mary: See, I knew it. I told you he's been working too hard. ",
        "Joe: Ok, so let me make sure I understand. Everything  you were saying \r\nthis morning about the disappearing woman -- ",
        "Frank: Is temporary insanity. I'm telling you, I really need some down time, \r\nand I'm going to take it. I'm going to steal a little time for myself, get away.\r\n",
        "Kevin: That's good. I know just the place. ",
        "Frank: Well, thanks, Kevin, but it's all taken care of. An old friend of mine \r\nin Alaska's got a spot -- no phones, no TV, just plenty of fish to catch, ice \r\nhockey to keep me busy. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I haven't been asked for my opinion, but I wouldn't be much of \r\nan in-law if I didn't at least offer it. I think the idea of you going away when \r\nyou could really use to dig in what you've just been through. ",
        "Frank: Are you kidding? I just got past thinking about all of that. What I \r\nneed now is fresh air. ",
        "Mary: Why can't we let him deal with this himself? He knows what he needs \r\nbetter than anyone. ",
        "Frank: Thanks for understanding, Mom. ",
        "Mary: I wish I could go with you. How about taking my rosary along? It'll \r\nhelp keep you safe, and a little part of me will have made it to Alaska. ",
        "Frank: You've got a deal. Now, I need to run out to the car, grab a couple \r\nthings, and start to get ready. ",
        "Mary: I'll have the rosary ready when you come back. Where did I put my \r\npurse? ",
        "Victor: Maybe you left it in the kitchen. ",
        "Mary: In the kitchen? ",
        "Gabriela: We'll help you look for it. ",
        "Lucy: Frank, wait. Listen, could I just bother you for a minute? Could I ask \r\nyou just one question about that woman you've been talking about? ",
        "Frank: Lucy, I just got finished -- ",
        "Lucy: I know, explaining and explaining and explaining that there is no Karen \r\nWexler. But there is a drawing that Kevin made for you of her, right? And I \r\nwould just love to see it, you know, see if there's any resemblance, maybe, \r\nbetween Scott and this Karen person. I mean, you did say that Scott could be \r\nKaren's father, right? ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry. If I still had it, no problem. But I don't. I tossed it.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Well, then let's dig it out. Let's go find it. You can get it out. ",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, it's gone, Lucy. Now, just let this be, would you, please? \r\nHopefully by the time I see you again, this will all be behind me. I just --",
        "Lucy: Frank, really. ",
        "Frank: There's no drawing and no Karen, ok? I'll see you. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. But -- ",

        "Granya: Ahem. Still your move, Ian. ",
        "Ian: I must be going mad. I don't know if this woman, Karen Wexler, is real \r\nor not. ",
        "Granya: Faith, brother. ",
        "Ian: Faith in what? That she exists or that Frank can bring her back safely? \r\nI don't want anyone else to get hurt. ",

There was a time when you first found out about it you weren't so happy, \r\nbut you kept your mind open and trusted me then, and in the end, that made us \r\nboth happy, right? Well, I'm asking you to keep an open mind again and trust \r\nthat I'd never leave without a good reason. I did something -- nothing against \r\nthe law or anything -- but I made a mistake.

Always remember that no matter where \r\nI am I'll still be with you and you'll be with me, too. You're a part of me, \r\nNeil. The best part. And you'll be traveling with me forever.
