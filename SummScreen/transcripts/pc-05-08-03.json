        "Elizabeth flirts with Kevin as he paints her portrait. Kevin is surprised to hear her describe him as being rather balanced. Glad to hear that Kevin has moved on from Lucy, Elizabeth offers to give him the choice of whether to paint her dressed or in the nude. Victor continues to defend his loyalty to Joshua. A police officer tries to arrest Lucy, but Ian's intervention allows her to break loose and handcuff herself to part of the church. Joshua is furious with Olivia, who has convinced him that she killed Alison with her poisoned fangs. Olivia is determined to take down every vampire that Joshua sends after her, to ensure that the self-proclaimed king has no kingdom. After provoking him into an attack, she sets off a smoke bomb and flees the villa. Despite his feelings on the matter, Rafe promises to help cure Olivia and allow Caleb to get his fangs back. Caleb admits to going along with this in order to save Alison from Joshua. Olivia returns to the catacombs with the news that Joshua believed her. Rafe plans to get inside Joshua's mind. Lucy collapses, and when the officer refuses to unlock the handcuffs, Ian vamps out, breaks her loose, and carries her out of the church. Caleb apologizes to Alison for killing her in the nightmare Rafe induced several months ago. Rafe plans to make Joshua think that Olivia bit him with her poisoned fangs, and then steal the antidote once he learns where it is. An angry Joshua informs Kevin and Elizabeth that Livvie killed Alison. Accusing him of lying, Elizabeth rushes out to find her daughter. Kevin reveals that he hasn't taken his latest dose of medication yet. Joshua orders Kevin to make Livvie pay for killing his bride-to-be."

        "Elizabeth: Is this all right here?",
        "Kevin: Excuse me, what?",
        "Elizabeth: Is this all right? Like this?",
        "Kevin: Oh, that's great. Definitely.",
        "Elizabeth: Your work is very good.",
        "Kevin: We'll see.",
        "Elizabeth: No, I'm serious. It's reminiscent of Munch. Edward Munch. \"The Scream\"?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I know who you mean.",
        "Elizabeth: It's quite a compliment, actually. In all of my travels throughout Europe, I've seen a plethora of poor imitations.",
        "Kevin: Well, thank you very much.",
        "Elizabeth: You know, your paintings are -- they're darkly interesting, which I find so ironic, considering that you're -- you're rather balanced.",
        "Kevin: Balanced?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. You're always so calm, serene.",
        "Kevin: Huh. It's been a while since anyone called me that.",
        "Elizabeth: Really?",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. You are. I actually find that you possess a number of qualities that I appreciate in a man right now. You're intelligent, sensitive, artistic. It must have been difficult for you -- the breakup with Lucy.",
        "Kevin: That's history. Lucy's no longer relevant.",
        "Elizabeth: Really?",
        "Kevin: Really. She's moved on and so have I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Victor, what are you doing? This is a church! It's a sacred place. Think about what you're doing.",
        "Victor: It wasn't necessary to be so destructive.",
        "Lucy: Oh!",
        "Ian: Have you lost your mind? What did Joshua do to you?",
        "Lucy: You have to fight him. Can't you see that? You have to fight Joshua.",
        "Victor: Fight what? This is what I want to do. Joshua Temple is taking this decaying, decrepit town into the 21st century, and I am lucky enough that he's asked me to help him do it.",
        "Lucy: That is not what he's doing. Joshua is evil, and he is destroying everything, and you're helping him!",
        "Ian: Look around you. Lucy came here for comfort, for solace, as people have for centuries. This is a place of worship.",
        "Victor: Well, they'll still be able to do that, after a fashion.",
        "Lucy: No, they won't.",
        "Victor: You can't think that tearing up a set of building plans is going to stop Joshua. He's still going to get what he wants.",
        "Ian: You need to leave now.",
        "Victor: I beg your pardon. I was sent here to secure the building and to make sure there are no trespassers.",
        "Lucy: You -- you're like his lackey. You're just helping him, that's all, just because he says to do something?",
        "Victor: Well, of course! He's my boss!",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God.",
        "Councilman Hayden: We heard there was a disturbance.",
        "Victor: Commissioner.",
        "Ian: No, it's --",
        "Victor: No, no, it's all taken care of.",
        "Lucy: Take -- what do you mean? \"Taken care of\"? No, it's not. You know what? It's not taken care of at all. I'm going to disturb the peace now.",
        "Victor: Lucy -- Lucy, please, you know how much I care about you. Now, please don't make trouble.",
        "Lucy: Oh, Victor --",
        "Officer: Let me handle this, Mr. Collins.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my -- oh, my God. You have the cops turned, too? What next, the police commission?? Is that it?",
        "Victor: Will everybody just calm down?",
        "Lucy: No! Ian?",
        "Ian: Hey, hey, you're not arresting her.",
        "Officer: Hey --",
        "Lucy: No, you -- hey, you know what? If you want me, you're going to have to take the whole church, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: You bitch. You insane, crazy little bitch. What have you done?",
        "Livvie: What does it look like? I killed Alison, and it was satisfying.",
        "Joshua: No, this is a trick. This isn't true.",
        "Livvie: Why would I lie to you, Joshua? You've done your homework. Alison and I are sworn enemies. This was the inevitable. And thanks to you, pretty easy.",
        "Joshua: Thanks to me?",
        "Livvie: You're the one who turned me into a killer. You're the one who poisoned me, you're the one who made sure anyone I bite will die. So you can sic any one of your vampires on me, and I will take them out one by one until you are the king of absolutely nothing.",
        "Joshua: You can take them all out, you little tramp, except for one -- the only one that counts and that is me.",
        "Livvie: Ah. Yes, the ring. Caleb didn't need jewelry to show his strength. You obviously do.",
        "Joshua: I'm going to enjoy killing you.",
        "Livvie: You know, I don't think you have what it takes. Nice picture. You destroyed my future happiness, and I just simply returned the favor. Give it your best shot, vampire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison sneezes]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: Bless you.",
        "Alison: Excuse me. Sorry. It's ok. I can do it. Let me just do it.",
        "Caleb: No sign of Olivia. This is taking too long.",
        "Rafe: Caleb, relax, ok? It's not going to be easy for her to convince Joshua that Alison's really dead.",
        "Caleb: When she's done her part, you ready for yours?",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Alison: This is very weird, all of us playing so nicely together.",
        "Rafe: Well, you know what? No one's doing this out of the goodness of their heart. Ok? And I'm not going to pretend to like the fact that once this is all over, he's going to have his fangs back.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, you don't have much choice. I'm doing this to save her from Joshua. And when it's over, you're going to fix things with Olivia.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And then you'll be king of the mountain.",
        "Caleb: And you get another chance at taking me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Hmm. You're going to kill me? I'm shaking in my boots.",
        "Joshua: Livvie.",
        "Livvie: You can do better than that. Then maybe again, you can't.",
        "Joshua: You stupid, stupid child.",
        "Livvie: More threats? Are you forgetting who taught me everything I know?",
        "Joshua: Did Caleb also teach you to think before you act? Did he tell you he and I have an agreement? I would give him the antidote to the poison, he would bring me Alison. You have just sealed your own fate, you stupid child.",
        "Livvie: No, what would have been stupid would be for me to believe that you would live up to your end of the deal. I don't trust you. And Alison's death is the sweetest revenge.",
        "Joshua: Time's up, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: I don't think so, Josh. Bye.",
        "[Joshua coughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You never did answer my question. You plan on continuing this little war with me, don't you?",
        "Rafe: Well, first things first.",
        "Alison: Yeah, let's just try and remember who were fighting, ok? And it's Joshua.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I -- I won't be forgetting Joshua any time soon.",
        "Rafe: I know, he's our first priority.",
        "Caleb: No, our first priority is Livvie coming back.",
        "Livvie: Mission accomplished.",
        "Caleb: Thank God.",
        "Rafe: That's funny, coming from you.",
        "Alison: So, how'd it go? Did he buy it?",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Yeah, he bought it, all right. He's just really ticked off.",
        "Alison: Well, what happened?",
        "Livvie: I hate to brag, but I was fabulous. It went even better than I hoped. And I've got to thank you for the smoke bomb that -- it worked really, really well.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I told you.",
        "Caleb: Livvie, you all right?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Caleb: Yeah?",
        "Livvie: Joshua is the one who's a mess. He really had it out for you.",
        "Caleb: All right. Well, look, now that we're done congratulating ourselves, it's your turn. Go do your thing, Rafe.",
        "Livvie: Which is?",
        "Rafe: It's an old angel's trick.",
        "Livvie: We're all laying our lives down on the line for each other. I don't think this is time for secrets.",
        "Alison: Well, it's very straightforward. Rafe's just going to crawl inside Joshua's head and proceed to drive him nuts.",

        "[Joshua growls]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: Lucy, what have you done?",
        "Lucy: Well, it looks to me like I just handcuffed myself to a church. What does it look like?",
        "Victor: But you can't --",
        "Ian: Well, seems she just did, Victor.",
        "Officer: You're under arrest.",
        "Councilman Hayden: Would someone find the key?",
        "Lucy: You know what? Even if they find it, you can't take me. I won't let you and you can't make me go.",
        "Ian: But, Lucy, please -- she's unarmed, she's harmless, and now she's chained herself to a church. How much damage can she do? Come on.",
        "Councilman Hayden: I suppose we could give her a minute to calm down.",
        "Lucy: Calm down? I'm not -- no! I don't calm down easily. Victor, look at us. Look what we're doing. Look at what we've become. We have to stop Joshua. He's evil. He cannot win. Do you understand? He can't.",
        "Victor: Lucy, this isn't worth fighting for.",
        "Lucy: Yes, it -- oh, my God. Of course it's worth fighting for! It's everything that we believe in. Victor, you are the man that I dearly love. And if you understand me, you would know you're supposed to be fighting with us -- with us!",
        "Ian: Lucy, will you -- take it easy.",
        "Lucy: I can't -- how? How am I supposed to take it easy? Listen to me, Victor. You're good. You're a good man. And Frank is a good man. And all the good people -- we have to stand up and fight Joshua together. Don't you understand? We have to destroy that evil creature, because I am not -- I will be damned if we let the worst in us beat the best in us. I couldn't stand tall if I let my children down, if I let myself down. Ian, I couldn't do it. I cannot let you down. Oh --",
        "Ian: Lucy. Lucy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Do you know about this?",
        "Caleb: About the nightmares? Yeah, he's given me a few.",
        "[Livvie chuckles]",
        "Livvie: No, I mean climbing into somebody's head.",
        "Alison: Look, I know this is going to sound kind of weird, but I'm living proof that Rafe can really do this.",
        "Livvie: Anybody's head?",
        "Rafe: Ahem -- well, actually, the person has to be kind of vulnerable -- which, assuming you did your job correctly, that should be the state that Joshua's in right about now, ok?",
        "Livvie: Well, yeah, he's a mess right now. So, is this like dream interpretation?",
        "Alison: Well, you know -- I mean, in mine, Rafe actually materialized and sort of showed me through it.",
        "Caleb: In yours? In your dream?",
        "Alison: Yeah. It was after my father died. And he wanted to show me some things about him. You know, our relationship and, I don't know, what might have been. It's sort of weird. I can't really describe it, but it's -- it's a very amazing talent. He showed me all kinds of things -- fantasy, truth, visions of what might have been.",
        "Rafe: Her greatest desire, basically, and -- and her worst fear.",
        "Alison: Yeah. The nightmare.",
        "Caleb: You gave Alison a nightmare?",
        "Alison: Well, no. I don't think he meant to. It was -- I was being very stubborn about something that he felt was very dangerous, so he just wanted to show me something very frightening.",
        "Caleb: Exactly what kind of nightmare does a man impose on the woman he loves?",
        "Alison: It doesn't really matter now.",
        "Caleb: No, it's just it's -- it's so unexpected for someone like you. I'm just curious.",
        "Alison: He did it to protect me.",
        "Rafe: It was you, Caleb. Yeah. You're Alison's worst nightmare.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: And you're a morning person or a night person?",
        "Kevin: Oh, a night, definitely.",
        "Elizabeth: Vanilla? Chocolate?",
        "Kevin: Are we talking the best here? Peach gelato on a wafer cup on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, at sunset.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, my God. Ah, ooh, I can just taste that.",
        "Kevin: You know, if you're tired, we can stop.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no, no, no. Just -- well, maybe just a little break. Hmm. Very nice.",
        "Kevin: It hasn't really begun to take form yet. But it will. Given that magnificent bone structure. You know, you really do have a face that cries out to be put on canvas.",
        "Elizabeth: That means so much to me, coming from you. Thank you.",
        "Kevin: I speak the truth.",
        "Elizabeth: Boy, if only my whole life were that simple.",
        "Kevin: Hmm.",
        "Elizabeth: I've paid the price for some bad choices.",
        "Kevin: You've made bad choices?",
        "Elizabeth: That should probably be on my epitaph. Yes, I've had a penchant for getting involved with men that -- I don't know how to say it -- I guess just never had my best interest in mind.",
        "Kevin: Well, then it's their loss and shame on them.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, doesn't matter. I'm inspired to turn my life around now. I think I deserve better.",
        "Kevin: Good for you.",
        "Elizabeth: Mm-hmm, yep. I am wide open to new adventures. I think it's time to start nurturing my more creative side now. You know? I think that a person is never really fully satisfied until they've developed a way to express themselves artistically.",
        "Kevin: Well, I highly recommend it.",
        "Elizabeth: Do you?",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm.",
        "Elizabeth: Maybe you can help me out.",
        "Kevin: It's worth a whirl.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. It'd be fun. I think that we have a lot to offer each other, Kevin. I feel a very strong connection to you that I felt the very first time I met you.",
        "Kevin: I couldn't agree more.",
        "Elizabeth: So you know what I say? I say you paint me now or whenever, however -- clothed, unclothed. It's your call, doctor.",
        "Kevin: Joshua.",
        "Joshua: I hate to break up this sweet little love fest, but I think it's only proper that you two be the first to know.",
        "Elizabeth: Know what?",
        "Joshua: Your daughter has killed your daughter.",
        "Elizabeth: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Lucy?",
        "Victor: What happened to her?",
        "Ian: Lucy, answer me.",
        "Councilman Hayden: Is she dead?",
        "Ian: Back off! She needs some air.",
        "Victor: Let him do what he has to do. He's a doctor. He'll know how to take care of her. What can I do?",
        "Ian: You've done enough. Give me the keys.",
        "Victor: Keys.",
        "Ian: Give me the keys!",
        "Officer: I don't know about uncuffing her. She's in violation of civil --",
        "[Ian growls]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I was your worst nightmare?",
        "Alison: You remember, don't you?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. You woke up and I was standing there with your mother. And you totally lost it. I'm your worst nightmare?",
        "Alison: Afraid so.",
        "Caleb: May I ask what happened?",
        "Alison: Um -- you were there, obviously, in my dream. And I thought that you were Stephen Clay. And you were my friend and you were asking me to trust you. But you weren't Stephen Clay, you were Caleb Morley. And I ran from you. And you cornered me and bared your fangs, and when I couldn't get away, you killed me. Rafe knew it, and he was just trying to make me see the truth.",
        "Livvie: Wow.",
        "Caleb: I guess I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: No, it's -- it doesn't really matter now.",
        "Caleb: I'm still sorry.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, all that matters now is that Joshua has the same kind of meltdown that Alison had.",
        "Rafe: Ok, here's the thing. Joshua is focused on his own survival, so what I'm going to do is get into that gray matter of his and make him think Livvie put the poisonous bite on him. So then he'll be so freaked out, he'll head straight for the antidote. And once he's revealed where the hiding place is, then we'll sneak in and steal it right from under his nose.",
        "Caleb: No tricks this time.",
        "Rafe: No tricks. A deal's a deal. Livvie gets cured, and you get your fangs back.",
        "Caleb: Who would have thought?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Who would have thought?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: It's a mistake.",
        "Elizabeth: No.",
        "Joshua: No mistake.",
        "Elizabeth: No. No. No. No, this isn't true. No, you're lying. You -- you son of a bitch, you're lying to me, aren't you?",
        "Joshua: Easy, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: No -- you know what it is, is you're just -- you're just trying to punish me! You're just jealous! You're angry, you're lying! This isn't true! No!",
        "Joshua: Alison is dead.",
        "Elizabeth: No!",
        "Joshua: Livvie killed her.",
        "Elizabeth: No, it's not! It's just -- go find my daughter. Going to find my daughter!",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Joshua: Kevin.",
        "Kevin: This could be bad, couldn't it?",
        "Joshua: This is bad. How are you? You taking your medication?",
        "Kevin: Oh, I will.",
        "Joshua: No, you have to take it. Look, I instructed you. You must always take it. It'll make you feel better. It'll take away the sadness.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Joshua: And you're right. This is very bad. And Livvie is your daughter. And you must do your duty as her father, and you must deal with her.",
        "Kevin: Deal with her?",
        "Joshua: Harshly.",
        "Kevin: You're right. Livvie has to be dealt with.",
        "Joshua: Now you get the picture. Livvie must pay for what she has done. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire.\"",

        "Caleb: Unless you hate him with every inch of your being, he'll beat you, and then we all lose.",
        "Chris: You know, this blood transfusion isn't going to cure her.",
        "Ian: I know, but it'll -- it'll give her the strength to fight it.",
