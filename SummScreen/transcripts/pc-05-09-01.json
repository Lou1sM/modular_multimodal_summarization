        "Frank's Voice: She has these beautiful, full lips, high cheekbones, and the \r\nmost incredible smile. ",
        "Kevin: Frank's mystery woman. Hello, Karen. Except you don't exist. What if \r\nLucy's right? What if she's right? ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Kevin: Come in. ",
        "Colleen: Oh. Sorry to bother you, Dr. Collins. I didn't expect you in this \r\nearly. ",
        "Kevin: Actually, I've been here all night. ",
        "Colleen: Is everything all right? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yeah, just a project I'm working on. What can I do for you? ",
        "Colleen: Oh, your 9:00, Mrs. Hansen, called to cancel. ",
        "Kevin: Oh. Well, good. That'll give me more time. ",
        "Colleen: For your project? ",
        "Kevin: That's right. ",
        "Colleen: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Kevin: Colleen? ",
        "Colleen: Yeah? ",
        "Kevin: Do me a favor, will you? Reschedule my whole morning. ",
        "Colleen: This project of yours must be pretty important. ",

        "Eve: All right. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, hello? ",
        "Chris: What, so I propose marriage, and you up and leave? ",
        "Eve: Chris? ",
        "Chris: Yes, it's Chris. How many other marriage proposals are you fielding?\r\n",
        "Eve: Well, yours is at the top of my list. ",
        "Chris: I see. So you're ditching all of us, then? ",
        "Eve: Well, don't take it personally. ",
        "Chris: Eve, how else should I take it? ",
        "Eve: Look, Chris, I just -- I have a lot on my mind, and I just need to get \r\naway and be alone. ",
        "Chris: I see. So you're going to think about my offer, then? ",
        "Eve: Well, I'm definitely going to think about your offer and everything \r\nelse. ",
        "Chris: All right. Well, that's great. You know, it's just I was worried about \r\nyou, you know, when I got your message saying that you were leaving. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I know. It's just that a lot of things hit me all at once, and, \r\nyou know, that's why I need to get away and try and get a handle on things. ",
        "Chris: I understand. I just want you to remember that I really do want to be \r\nthere for you and the baby. ",
        "Eve: Ian's baby. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, I know. But you can't be with Ian. ",
        "Eve: Thanks for reminding me. ",
        "Chris: I'm not trying to give you a hard time here. ",
        "Eve: Look, I know, I know. I know you're not. I'm just -- I'm just a little \r\ntouchy these days, that's all. ",
        "Chris: You have good reason. ",
        "Eve: Right, which is exactly why I need to get away. Ok? Just for a little \r\nwhile -- time alone to think. ",
        "Chris: Well, remember, I'm just offering a safety net. You know, no pressure.\r\n",
        "Eve: Chris, I appreciate that. ",
        "Chris: Where can I reach you? ",
        "Eve: You can't. See, that's the point. I will get in touch with you. ",
        "Chris: Eve, are you sure about all this? There are three flights a day \r\nleaving for Vegas. We could be married by dinner. ",
        "Eve: No, I am positive, ok? I'm absolutely positive. I will call you. Don't \r\nworry about me, please. All right? Now, I'll talk to you soon, ok? Bye. ",

        "Frank: You look like hell. ",
        "Ian: I'm in good company, then. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. Did you get any sleep last night? ",
        "Ian: Uh-uh. Not much. Arianna's getting worse. If we don't find a donor soon \r\n-- ",
        "Frank: Look, I told you -- ",
        "Ian: I know, I know -- Karen. ",
        "Frank: She exists. Or she will, as soon as I go back to 1973, disable that \r\ncomputer so Cookie -- Rhonda Wexler -- and I never connect. Then she can go to \r\nthat dance and meet Scott Baldwin. ",
        "Ian: And Karen will be born. ",
        "Frank: All I need are those herbs that you and the chief were talking about \r\nto take me back. ",
        "Ian: Well, they're on a flight from the island this morning. ",
        "Frank: Man, this -- this all sounds so crazy. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. What'd you tell your family? ",
        "Frank: Fishing trip to Alaska. I think they bought it that I'm burned out and \r\nI need to get away. They'd lock me up if they knew what I was really doing. ",
        "Ian: They'd lock all of us up. But as long as they believe you. All right. I \r\ngot to go find that plane, get the package, and -- ",
        "Frank: Hey, Ian? ",
        "Ian: Yeah? ",
        "Frank: Thank you. ",
        "Ian: Well, thank you -- for Arianna, for Eve, for me. Let's just hope it \r\nworks. ",
        "Frank: It will work. I will bring you home, Karen. I promise. ",

        "Frank: Thanks again for the time off. It's kind of an emergency, but I'll be \r\nback on the job as soon as I can. I will. Thanks. ",

        "Kevin: Do you have a minute? ",
        "Frank: I have a plane to catch. ",
        "Kevin: Right, to Alaska. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, that's where I'm going. ",
        "Kevin: Well, this won't take very long -- just a second. ",
        "Frank: So, what's up? ",
        "Kevin: Look, Frank, I've been thinking about what you've been saying about \r\nthis Karen and talking to Rhonda Wexler in 1973 -- ",
        "Frank: Look, I told all of you last night -- I'm fried, ok? Too much work, \r\nnot enough sleep. I need a breather. ",
        "Kevin: You're just going to take off like that? No luggage? ",
        "Frank: It's in the car. ",
        "Kevin: You have your fishing gear? ",
        "Frank: That, too. ",
        "Kevin: Just can't get away fast enough, huh? ",
        "Frank: I really do need to cool out. ",
        "Kevin: Well, fishing should do that. ",
        "Frank: That's the plan. So, thanks for stopping by. ",
        "Kevin: You must be pretty close to this person. ",
        "Frank: What? ",
        "Kevin: Your friend in Alaska. Who'd you think I was talking about? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, we're pretty tight. ",
        "Kevin: Must be to go all that way. Who was it again? ",
        "Frank: Nobody you'd know. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Sorry, I can't help wondering. ",
        "Frank: Just wondering if I'm still wigged out is more like it. ",
        "Kevin: No. That's not it at all. ",
        "Frank: Then what's with all the questions? ",
        "Kevin: To be honest, I was hoping I could come along. I mean, I could use \r\nsome time off myself, and I tie a mean fly. ",
        "Frank: I don't think so. ",
        "Kevin: Well, come on, there's always room for one more on a fishing trip, \r\nright? ",
        "Frank: Not this trip. ",
        "Kevin: Why not? Because there isn't one? We both know you're not going on any \r\nfishing trip. ",

        "Eve: I can't believe this. Why now? Why? ",
        "Eve: No. No, I'm not taking any chances this time. I'm going to take perfect \r\ncare of you. ",
        "Eve: Hi. This is Dr. Eve Lambert. I'm calling again. I called a little while \r\nago. I'm stuck here. I really need somebody to come out. Normally I wouldn't \r\nmind that much. I can change a tire myself. I'm not one of those wimpy kind of \r\nchicks, but I'm -- I'm on my way to a medical conference, and I can't really get \r\nmessed up right now. Thank you. I appreciate it. ",
