        "Chris: Everything's all set up.",
        "Ian: All right. Here.",
        "Chris: You know this blood transfusion isn't going to cure her.",
        "Ian: I know, but it'll help give her the strength to fight.",
        "Chris: Yeah, it would help if we knew what we were fighting.",
        "Ian: I know it would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, that's where you can spend some alone time if you -- you know what I'm saying. But does this place look awesome, or what?",
        "Jamal: Or what.",
        "Casey: Hey, you know, it looks sweet and all, but the vibe is just wrong.",
        "Jack: It kind of throws you off, huh?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah.",
        "Jack: No one likes a predictable club.",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah, you got everything. And with a vampire running this place, you never know what's going to happen next.",
        "Jack: Come on, Jamal. Not this again, all right?",
        "Jamal: What? What? What? What? The truth get you down?",
        "Jack: No, the truth is you got to find a way to make it work for you and not fight it.",
        "Jamal: What, and forget everything else, huh? Do you even care what Joshua's up to? Did you even think to ask why did Joshua buy this place? Did you?",
        "Jack: It's a gig, Jamal. His money's the same color as ours.",
        "Jamal: What?",
        "Jack: It is.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no.",
        "Jack: Just relax. Let's enjoy.",
        "Elizabeth: No oh, I went to the gym apartment, and she wasn't there. And I called her cell phone, and it was just her little voice.",
        "Jamal: Well, wait -- calm down, calm down.",
        "Elizabeth: I called Amanda, and she's not there.",
        "Jack: Here, here, here.",
        "Elizabeth: And you guys are all here and she isn't, and I don't know where else to go.",
        "Casey: I'll go get her some water.",
        "Jack: Yeah, get her some water. Get her some water.",
        "Elizabeth: I'm all alone now. I'm just going to be all alone.",
        "Jamal: Look, you're not making any sense.",
        "Elizabeth: I want my baby!",
        "Jack: Ok, hold on. I'll go get Alison, ok? It'll be ok.",
        "Elizabeth: No, you can't. No one can. She's -- she's dead. My little Alison is dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I really hate it that people think that I'm dead right now. My mother, Jamal, nana.",
        "Livvie: As long as Joshua thinks you're dead, it'll all be worth it.",
        "Alison: I know. It's just a little hard right now, ok?",
        "Livvie: Well, nothing's the way any of us wants it to be.",
        "Alison: You really want to bite him, don't you?",
        "Livvie: Caleb and I want to be together forever. It's just if I lose control, I -- God, I can't let that happen.",
        "Alison: Why? Because you're afraid that you might kill him?",
        "Livvie: Again. I know you don't understand what Caleb and I have, Alison.",
        "Alison: No, I really don't, Livvie, but that's -- whatever. I do know what it's like to not want to lose the man you love. I wonder what they're talking about out there.",
        "Livvie: Strategy, I'm sure. No one knows the way Joshua's ugly mind works better than Caleb.",
        "Alison: I never in a million years would have ever thought that they'd be working together.",
        "Livvie: Well, did you ever think we'd be together like this again?",
        "Alison: Nope. Definitely not.",
        "Livvie: How we used to do it all the time.",
        "Alison: Yeah, we did. It was a really long time ago.",
        "Livvie: Yeah.",
        "Alison: It's funny but ironic, actually. You and I are both fighting for just about the same thing.",
        "Livvie: I just -- I just want to be with Caleb, that's all.",
        "Alison: For eternity. And all Rafe and I have ever wanted was just to be normal.",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe we'll both get what we want.",
        "Alison: Yep, that's the plan.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Alison: It's too bad that we can never be friends again. Not the way that we used to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You know what? The last thing I need is a pep talk from you, ok?",
        "Caleb: I didn't bring you out here to give you a pep talk.",
        "Rafe: Really? So why are you wasting my time?",
        "Caleb: Look, I know a few things about giving people nightmares, and in Joshua's case, it's going to take a true visual from hell.",
        "Rafe: All right, all right, all right, let me tell you something. This guy is a coward. The second he thinks that Livvie has bitten him with her poisonous fangs, he's going to run right for the antidote, all right?",
        "Caleb: Uh-uh. That's not enough. Look, you were able to get inside Alison's head because you love her, because you wanted to protect her.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, from you.",
        "Caleb: Bringing down Joshua is going to take that same level of passion, only this time it's got to be about hatred, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: All right, trust me, trust me, all right? I have plenty of hate for that guy.",
        "Caleb: Do you? Have you thought about what he's going to do to her if makes her his bride?",
        "Rafe: That's not going to happen.",
        "Caleb: Well, think about it anyway. Think about it anyway. Because unless you hate him with every inch of your being, he'll beat you. And then we all lose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: How are you feeling?",
        "Lucy: The church. We have to save the church. We got to get back to the church.",
        "Ian: Shh, shh, shh.",
        "Lucy: We have to get back.",
        "Ian: We're not saving anything tonight. You have to relax.",
        "Lucy: I am relaxed. If we don't go back to that church, it'll be gone, it'll be destroyed. We have to stop Joshua from destroying everything, the whole town. We have to get back--",
        "Ian: Ok, ok, hey, hey, hey. I can't focus on the whole town right now. The only thing I can focus on is you, and you should do the same.",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Ian: No, no, no --",
        "Lucy: But we need to get back.",
        "Ian: Shh. Listen to me. No more airports. No more running around this town. No more sit-ins and churches. We're done.",
        "Lucy: We're not done. I'm so afraid -- I'm so afraid of what's happening to all of us.",
        "Ian: So am I. So am I, but right now, you need to spend as much time protecting yourself as you do other people. Do it for me. Do it for your children. And do it for you.",
        "Lucy: Right, it's just I need to get some strength back.",
        "Ian: Exactly.",
        "Lucy: And then I'm --",
        "Ian: No, no, shh. You just had a blood transfusion. Now all you need to do is rest.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Rest. I will close my eyes for two seconds and then I'll --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, Alison's dead?",
        "Jamal: No way. No.",
        "Elizabeth: I just keep seeing her beautiful smile.",
        "Jamal: Look, Elizabeth, you got to get a hold of yourself, ok?",
        "Casey: You guys, take it easy, all right?",
        "Elizabeth: We just found each other. We were working on this relationship. We were just finding --",
        "Jamal: No one cares about all that, ok? Why don't you just tell us what you think happened.",
        "Elizabeth: I saw --",
        "Jack: Well, saw what? Was there an accident?",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, no. I saw this. It was no accident. Livvie bit her. Livvie killed Alison!",
        "[Elizabeth cries]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I've done a lot of really awful things to you.",
        "Alison: Yeah. You have. I mean, I know that Caleb changed you, but it was still you who did them.",
        "Livvie: I was just -- I was really angry. And bitter. And jealous.",
        "Alison: Jealous? Why?",
        "Livvie: Because you knew what you wanted. Somehow with Rafe, you always knew that he was the one. Whether he was there or not, you knew what made you complete.",
        "Alison: And you didn't?",
        "Livvie: I couldn't trust what Caleb and I had, so I destroyed it. I destroyed him.",
        "Alison: No. You destroyed him because he was a vampire and he was doing bad things.",
        "Livvie: No, he was just getting back at everyone for what they had done to him, and he was going after what he wanted.",
        "Alison: Right. And what he really wanted was you.",
        "Livvie: He had faith in us. And no matter how many times I betrayed him or I got scared, he didn't give up on me.",
        "Alison: So what? He was gone, so you decided to take it out on ?? Thanks.",
        "Livvie: I thought you wanted to take everything away from me -- Jack, my father, everything I ever cared about, all because of your undying love for Rafe. So I did anything I could to fill that emptiness. And it wasn't until Caleb came back that I realized what I should have known all along -- he's my destiny.",
        "Alison: Oh, right. And I suppose being a vampire is your destiny, too?",
        "Livvie: Yes. Look, I know you will never understand what I am going through. But, Alison, wouldn't you follow Rafe wherever he went? Wouldn't you do anything for him? It's like we're getting a second chance on life here, and I want to live my life this time. What?",
        "Alison: Nothing. I was just trying to remember what it was like, you know, before when we didn't think that vampires were real.",
        "Livvie: Or angels?",
        "Alison: Ahem. Point taken.",
        "Livvie: You say all you want is to live a normal life, but if living normal is being with the man you love freely, then that makes me no different than you.",
        "Alison: It does make you very different from me. You will always be a vampire. Your love for a vampire has changed your life completely. It'll never actually be normal again.",
        "Livvie: And your love for an angel has changed you completely. So face it, Alison. By other people's standards, neither one of us will ever be normal again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Thanks for the advice, but like I told you, I've already had plenty of practice protecting Alison from you.",
        "Caleb: Joshua's different.",
        "Rafe: What's that -- Joshua's different? Are you telling me something I don't know? Is this important information? What are you telling me, huh? Hmm?",
        "Caleb: Joshua enjoys cruelty. The more people suffer, the more powerful he feels. It'll be no different with Alison. He won't just want to bite her, Rafe. He'll want to conquer her. Breaking her will be his greatest achievement, and he will take his time doing it. He will want to strip away every ounce of dignity she has until she hates herself. And when she's got no fight left in her, when he's completely crushed that spirit, when he feels free to use her --",
        "Rafe: Shut up.",
        "Caleb: When all of your love has been destroyed, only then will he feed on her, savor her, taste your defeat in her blood, crown this empire of his with his bride-to-be for eternity. I'm not the enemy, man. He is. But I think you get the point. Now take that hatred and use it to take him down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Lucy Coe. Heart of a lion. Willing to protect the whole town. Well, I'm here to protect you. And I will find a way to fix this. All you have to do is rest. I'll take care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry you all had to find out the truth like this. I'm sorry for all of us who loved her. Excuse me.",
        "Jack: I can't believe this.",
        "Jamal: You're coat tailing it with vampires. The vampires are the ones who killed her. I mean, I'm surprised you're not hanging with Livvie, too.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa. Look, I didn't want this to happen. Alison's my friend, too.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, some friend you are. With everything Alison had going on in her life, she was still worried about you.",
        "Jack: I know she was.",
        "Jamal: You're too busy selling your soul to the highest bidder. Did you even stop to think about her? Did you?",
        "Casey: You know, maybe we should go, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Don't you -- don't touch me.",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Jamal: Alison -- she fought for your soul. She put her life on the line when you were a vampire. You just sold her out, dude.",
        "Jack: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jamal: I know what I'm talking about. Didn't you just say that their money was the same color? Didn't you say that? They're ruthless, heartless animals, and you working for them makes you the same thing.",
        "Jack: You know what? I'll talk to you tomorrow when you've cooled down.",
        "Jamal: Whatever, dude, tomorrow, the next day, the day after that -- Alison is still not going to be here. Dude, she always had your back. She always had your back, and you know that. You might as well have just stuck a knife in hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Alison.",
        "Livvie: Hey, what happened?",
        "Alison: You're shaking. What's the -- what did you guys talk about?",
        "Rafe: It doesn't matter now. All that matters is you.",
        "Caleb: I told Rafe what he needed to do to get to Joshua so we can be together.",
        "Livvie: Do you think he can do it?",
        "Caleb: I don't like trusting slayers, especially him. Yeah, he can do it.",
        "Livvie: Good. So we can be together and we don't ever have to hold back again.",
        "Rafe: I just want a picture of this -- the beautiful way you are, the way you should always be.",
        "Alison: I don't doubt that you can do this, ok?",
        "Rafe: For you. I can do it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I just keep thinking that I should be doing something, but I end up just wandering around. Do you mind if I just sit here?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: I can't believe this.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to believe.",
        "Jamal: You know, before -- before her, people never really thought much of me, so I just gave them what they expected, just like any other kid would.",
        "Casey: Till you met Alison.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, she didn't let me get away with it. I was all pretending like I didn't care, but she -- she saw who I really was. She always stood by me. We really loved each other, and that was the first time that that happened for both of us. Even when we split up, she was the only reason why I believed in myself.",
        "Casey: That's what you got to keep doing, all right, Jamal? You got to keep faith because a lot of times, there's a lot more things going on that -- there's just a higher plan.",
        "Jamal: Higher plan? How could you even say something like that? The most beautiful, amazing, generous person I've ever known in my life is gone, and she had a whole life ahead of her. And you're talking about some higher plan? What the hell's wrong with you?",
        "Casey: I just mean that --",
        "Jamal: No, don't tell me about no heaven. Don't tell me about nothing else, nothing like that, ok? Because -- matter of fact, you know what? I don't even know why you're here. What good are you doing?",
        "Casey: I was trying to help, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Well, you're not. Ok, people are being turned, the town's being destroyed. My baby's gone. You're an angel. A guardian angel at that. You haven't done a damn thing to stop it. So you tell me one thing, Casey -- why the hell should I believe? That's what I thought. Because there's nothing else left to believe in.",
        "Casey: Just so you know, not being able to tell them this really sucks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Ramsey. Thanks.",
        "Chris: For what?",
        "Ian: You know for what. This wasn't exactly a standard case. And we're not exactly friends, are we?",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, you just needed a good doctor, that's all. Well, I'm the best. You're a close second, of course.",
        "Ian: Of course. Well, like I said, thank you. How do you think the blood transfusion's working?",
        "Chris: Well, should stabilize her for now, but you know the more the toxin spreads, the less pumping her full of new blood is going to help.",
        "Ian: I know, I know. But maybe that'll give us enough time to find out what the toxin is and to stop it.",
        "Lucy: Hmm.",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Lucy: Ian -- I -- I don't want to admit this -- I think you were right. I think that transfusion's actually working. I feel a lot better. Ah.",
        "Ian: It's all that matters. It's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe's gone to the villa.",
        "Caleb: That's good.",
        "Alison: What did you say to him out there?",
        "Caleb: I just gave him some insights into Joshua's mind.",
        "Alison: Great. I wouldn't want to go there.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, Rafe has to go there. He's going to be all right.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: You know, we're all going to be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Oh, Alison, I had such plans for you. How dare anyone ruin my crowning glory. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jamal: Where's Livvie, your psychopath daughter? She has to pay for what she's done.",
        "Kevin: I couldn't agree more.",
        "Caleb: When I get my crack at Joshua, believe me, the nightmare ain't going to be in his head.",
        "Rafe: I'd say \"sweet dreams, Joshua,\" but it's not exactly what I have in mind."
