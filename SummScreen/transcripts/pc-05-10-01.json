        "Alison: Yes, owning your own business definitely has its perks. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, like closing early to go clubbing. ",
        "Alison: Yep. ",
        "Livvie: In the Big Apple! ",
        "Jack: Whose bright idea was this? ",
        "Alison: It was mine, of course. Come on, now. I'm dying to check out that new \r\nclub. It's outside the east village -- full-service. It's in an old gas station.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, she's lifting her ideas from the best. ",
        "Alison: No, I am not, Jamal. I have ideas of my own, thank you. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool. You know, that makes this party \r\ntax deductible. Life is good. ",
        "Jack: Now that Zach's out of the picture. ",
        "Alison: Excuse me, can we please get in? Open the door just a little bit \r\nwider. Wait, wait, wait -- ",
        "Jamal: You know what? This is crazy. Let's just, um -- we're wasting time. \r\nLet's just get out of here. ",
        "Alison: No, wait, Jamal, just for a second. I need to change, please. ",
        "Livvie: Whoa. ",
        "Jack: She really does. ",
        "Alison: Please. ",
        "",
        "Joe: Hey, Kev, got a minute? ",
        "Kevin: Uh, sure. Coffee? ",
        "Joe: No, thanks. This thing with Frank's already got me on edge. ",
        "Kevin: Is that what you want to talk about? ",
        "Joe: Yeah. Any more thoughts on the subject? ",
        "Kevin: I know you're worried about him, I know you love him, but I do think \r\nthe best thing that any of us can do right now is just back off and let Frank \r\nwork through this. ",
        "Joe: Look, he didn't even leave a phone number where we could reach him or \r\nthe name of his buddy in Alaska. ",
        "Kevin: I know, but I'm sure he'll be in touch when he's ready. ",
        "Joe: I just wish he would've stuck closer to home, you know? Look, I got to \r\ngo. Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: Sure. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. I want you to give me a great big thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Should I be worried? ",
        "Lucy: No, I have ferreted out some very, very valuable information. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, Kevin, be worried -- be very worried. ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, listen to me, our suspicions have been confirmed. I checked \r\nwith the airport. That flight that Frank was supposed to be on to Alaska? He \r\nwasn't. ",
        "Kevin: Because he's looking for that girl -- Karen. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, the alleged daughter of Rhonda Wexler, the phantom physician? ",
        "Kevin: That's right. ",
        "Lucy: Uh-huh. So you're ok with this? I mean, you're cool with the fact that \r\nFrank is playing Don Quixote, tilting toward this Frank/Karen Wexler-Dulcinea \r\nreunion thingy? ",
        "Kevin: Surprised? ",
        "Lucy: No. I'm absolutely stunned. Doc, you never, ever, ever cease to \r\namaze me. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Is everything ready? Is it time for me to try to go back to 1973? ",
        "Chief: Patience. ",
        "Frank: Look, I have got to get back there. I've got to find Rhonda and that \r\ncomputer and fix this mess. ",
        "Ian: The chief will take care of it. You'll get Karen back. ",
        "Chief: In a few hours, all will be ready. But this does not guarantee your \r\nsuccess. ",
        "Frank: This has got to work -- for Karen and for me, for Arianna. ",
        "Chief: And for Eve and Ian. ",
        "Frank: Oh, man. If I had never made contact with Rhonda on that damn \r\ncomputer, none of this would have ever happened. I wouldn't have changed the \r\npast. ",
        "Chief: You didn't know what would happen. ",
        "Frank: Ok, all right, look, I'm -- I'm really getting antsy here. Could we \r\nplease just get started? ",
        "Chief: Well, not yet. There's some things you must know first. Now, you must \r\nfocus solely on your feelings for Karen, the depth of your love. Now, that is \r\nwhat will guide you through your mission. ",
        "Frank: That won't be hard. I love Karen enough to get me through anything.\r\n",
        "Chief: Well, keep that belief foremost in your mind and your heart. ",
        "Frank: It always is. ",
        "Chief: Now, you're going back to 1973, but part of you will remain here in \r\nthe year 2001. Now, you can't stay in this state forever, Frank. At some point, \r\nyou'll begin to feel the pull of the two universes. ",
        "Frank: What does that mean? ",
        "Chief: Your body will begin to feel the strain. You'll become tired, weak. \r\nNow, this is the sign that your time in the past is running out. ",
        "Frank: Then what? ",
        "Chief: You'll have to come back to the present, whether you've completed your \r\nmission or not. ",
        "Frank: I will complete it. For everyone's sake. ",
        "",
        "Alison: That lowlife piece of wannabe gangster trash. Please, did he really \r\nthink that we were going to hide the tape in the cheesy poofs? ",
        "Livvie: Maybe he and his thugs got hungry. ",
        "Jack: Nothing like destroying somebody's crib to help you work up an \r\nappetite. ",
        "Jamal: It was right where I left it, in plain sight with the rest of the \r\ntapes. ",
        "Livvie: You're kidding. ",
        "Jamal: No, between the Macy Gray and Busta Rhymes. Our insurance is intact, \r\nbaby. ",
        "Alison: Well, I would like to think myself as a nonviolent person, but I want \r\nZach's heart on a platter for this. ",
        "Jamal: He doesn't have one, ok? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, he's not going to have any legs, either, when I'm through \r\nwith him. Look what he did to our place, Jamal! ",
        "Jamal: I know, I know. I hate it, too, ok? And to make sure it doesn't happen \r\nagain, I'm going to give Zach exactly what he worked so hard for -- the tape.\r\n",
        "Alison: Have you lost your mind? ",
        "Jack: Oh, you didn't. ",
        "Jamal: No, I called a messenger at the shop, ok? A guy picked up a copy just \r\na few minutes ago. ",
        "Alison: No, Jamal -- ",
        "Jamal: What? Look, just hear me out, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok, fine, fine. Ok, we will hear you out. That's fine. This better be \r\ngood. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we have enough on this tape to put Zach behind bars, right? ",
        "Alison: Yes, right. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, so once he hears himself admitting to the race-fixing and \r\nthreatening us, he'll know that if he stirs up any more trouble, a copy will be \r\nsent to one of the authorities. ",
        "Livvie: Now that made sense. ",
        "Jack: Sounds like a solid plan to me. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come here. Come here. Hey. I swear, Zach isn't going to win this \r\none. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. You want to know how we're going to be sure? Because we're not \r\nwaiting. We're going to take a copy of this tape to the authorities right now.\r\n",
        "",
        "Ian: There may be someone, a woman, who can help you. ",
        "Arianna: Do I know her? ",
        "Ian: Uh, no. Frank is the only one who seems to know her. And anyway, he's \r\narranged for a -- he's arranged for a little trip to go find her and bring her \r\nback so she can help you. ",
        "Arianna: How's she going to help me? ",
        "Ian: Well, he's convinced that she's a match for you. So he'll find her and \r\nhe'll bring her back here and -- ",
        "Arianna: It's too late. ",
        "Ian: Don't say that. ",
        "Arianna: Ian, the time has come for acceptance. ",
        "Ian: Why are you saying that? What, you just going to -- just going to lay \r\nhere and let your life slip away like that? What happened to the brave girl who \r\nwas determined that she would find a life that's filled with happiness, a place \r\nwhere she could find love? ",
        "Arianna: But not with you. ",
        "Ian: Not with me. I care about you, Arianna -- I do. Maybe not in the way \r\nthat you want, but I do care, and maybe not in the way that is waiting for you \r\nsomewhere. But you've gone through so much, you've braved so much. Don't you \r\ngive up now. You don't give up now. ",
        "Arianna: I'm just so frightened. ",
        "Ian: I know. I know you are. But you have to focus on what's waiting for you. \r\nYou have to focus on a good life, on a better life. Because if you will do that, \r\nit'll happen. You will survive this, I swear it, you will. ",
        "",
        "Chief: Nervous? ",
        "Frank: Well, it's not something you do every day. ",
        "Chief: Do you have any last questions before you leave us? ",
        "Frank: It's hard to know what to ask when nobody's ever really done this \r\nbefore. ",
        "Chief: Well, think hard. You will not have another opportunity. ",
        "Frank: Well, I know I'm supposed to focus on my love for Karen, but what if I \r\nland in another -- another year or town? ",
        "Chief: The morca opens the door of possibilities. How and where you \r\ntravel is up to you. If your love is strong enough -- ",
        "Frank: It is. That I'm sure of. ",
        "Chief: Then tell me about her, the woman you seek. ",
        "Frank: Well, other than my son, Karen is the most important part of me. ",
        "Chief: Of your life, you mean. ",
        "Frank: Uh-uh. Of me. I have done so many things in my life I'm not proud of, \r\nbut Karen accepts me for me. She never smacks me with any of the old baggage. \r\nYou know, in fact, she's helped me unpack most of it. She's made me a better man \r\nthan I ever was. You know, I can't even describe her the way she deserves. ",
        "Chief: Well, you just did. ",
        "Frank: And she's smart. If I would've listened to her, I would've tossed out \r\nthat old computer a long time ago and I wouldn't have screwed up our lives. She \r\nwas freaked out by me communicating with some kid from 1973 and she told me to \r\nstop, but I wouldn't listen. ",
        "Chief: Focus not on the error but on the remedy. ",
        "Frank: Finding the computer and make sure it never works. ",
        "Chief: Fix your mistake, but do not try to fix anything else. ",
        "Frank: What does that mean? ",
        "Chief: You will see friends, family, and know where their past leads them. \r\nYou'll be tempted to alter their lives, but you must resist this temptation. ",
        "Frank: But if I can fix one thing, why not something else? ",
        "Chief: You're traveling back to rectify the mistake you made. You're setting \r\nthings to right, if it is possible. You must not compound your problems or \r\nanyone else's by attempting to play God. Accomplish what you must. Leave \r\neverything else alone. And when you return -- if you return -- you must never \r\nspeak of what you experienced. ",
        "Frank: Why? ",
        "Chief: Because it could be very dangerous. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Frank: How's Arianna? ",
        "Ian: She's hanging in. ",
        "Frank: Well, before I launch into the great unknown, if I -- if I hit any \r\ntime warp -- ",
        "Ian: You'll do just fine. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, but, uh, just in case there is a problem, \r\nwould you give that to my mom? And that to Neil? I have been very lucky. ",
        "Chief: Frank, I want you to lie down and tell me when you first contacted \r\nCookie. ",
        "Frank: March 9. ",
        "Chief: Keep that date foremost in your mind. Concentrate. ",
        "Frank: March 9, 1973. March 9. ",
        "Chief: When you reach your destination, you will only disable the computer, \r\nwhich will set events on a course to return Karen to this world. ",
        "Frank: I will not interfere with anyone or anything else. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Look, you said that you made the tape so that you could give it to \r\nthe cops, right? Why don't we just stick to the original plan and do that? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know what I said, Spunky. I don't trust the cops, ok, even \r\nwith the tape. Once Zach hears this, he will back off. ",
        "Alison: Maybe. But maybe he will press even harder. ",
        "Jamal: Why you got to jump to all that? Come on. ",
        "Alison: Oh, gee, um, Jamal, I don't know. Maybe it's because, you know, he \r\nturned our place into ground zero, ok? Just let the police handle it from here \r\non out. ",
        "Jamal: No, I told you, I do not trust them. ",
        "Alison: So give the tape to Dara, ok? Just let the D.A.'s office handle this.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Look, Spunky, I'm not going to let Zach hurt you. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, this isn't about me being, like, terrified for myself. I'm \r\nscared for us. Zach has way too much power in our lives right now and I don't \r\nwant him near us ever again. ",
        "Jamal: He won't bother us anymore, Spunky. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, you can't -- ",
        "Jamal: He won't, he won't. ",
        "Alison: No, you cannot predict what a maniac like that will do because you \r\ncan't. ",
        "Jamal: Can't argue there. ",
        "Alison: Right. So we're going to take a copy of that tape to the police.",
        "Jamal: No. To Dara. ",
        "Alison: Right. But first we play the tape. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: You're still here? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, yes. Of course I am because I can't stay away from you. But also, I \r\nwant to get you to tell me something. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I was afraid of that. ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, listen, I want to know why, why did you let Frank off the \r\npsychiatric hook? ",
        "Kevin: I believed him. ",
        "Lucy: You did?",
        "Kevin: No, I think this is nuts. It sounds like science fiction, if you ask \r\nme. But when you get down to it, it doesn't really matter. Frank believes in \r\nthis woman's existence, and whether I do or not, he does. You think I made the \r\nwrong move. ",
        "Lucy: No, come on, you know me better than that, Doc. You know what you did? \r\nYou put all that book learning, all that common sense and logic and you smushed \r\nit and you let your inner beliefs come through. ",
        "Kevin: Well, yesterday, I thought Frank was a candidate for daily therapy. \r\nToday, I -- ",
        "Lucy: You aren't so sure, are you? ",
        "Kevin: Well, what if he gets himself into trouble? ",
        "Lucy: No, but what if -- just what if he finds the kind of happiness that we \r\nhave? Don't you think the risk would be worth it? Wait a minute. By the way, how \r\ndid you get Frank to admit that whole Alaska trip was bogus? ",
        "Kevin: I showed him this. Wait a minute, do you recognize her? ",
        "Lucy: I, uh -- I don't know. I'm not sure. ",
        "Kevin: Well, Frank did. I drew her from memory after he described her to me \r\nonce. ",
        "Lucy: This is Frank's Karen. Oh, my goodness, Doc. You know what, there is -- \r\nthere is a sort of a slight resemblance to Rhonda. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that could be a subconscious addition on my part. Frank keeps \r\nsaying that she's Rhonda's daughter. ",
        "Lucy: What if she is? I mean, why couldn't she be? Come on, plenty of girls \r\nin the sixties and seventies had a child, got pregnant, and then gave it up for \r\nadoption just with a few family members knowing that, so this could be, like, a \r\ngreat, huge, big secret Rhonda's been keeping. ",
        "Kevin: Whether it is or not, this is the woman that Frank's looking for. ",
        "Lucy: And we are going to help Frank find her, aren't we? Oh, Doc, \r\nthis is so great. It's like riding a stationary bike. You never forget how to \r\nget on and -- ",
        "Kevin: Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. ",
        "Lucy: You just keep peddling. ",
        "Kevin: Just dismount for a minute. ",
        "Lucy: Why? This is us. This is old times again, solving all the mysteries of \r\nthe ages -- or at least the mystery of the here and now. ",
        "Kevin: Not this time. I promised Frank. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, you didn't. Say it ain't so. ",
        "Kevin: Didn't I hear a rumor of a board meeting right about now? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh, I was going to go to the bakery and get some buns. I'm \r\ngoing to take these buns. Ok, Doc, listen, you have to believe I know you're \r\nright about everything, always, and it's because you always listen to your inner \r\nvoice. Which I guess suspiciously sounds a lot like me these days, huh? Now you \r\nlook really worried. I got to go. I got to go. Ok, I love you. Oh, yeah, ok, ok. \r\nI'll see you. ",
