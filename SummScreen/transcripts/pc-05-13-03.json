        "Casey finds Jamal, who explains that he was going after Livvie when someone attacked him from behind. Jamal is angry with Casey for not doing more to help his friends. Alison worries about Rafe's prolonged absence, but Caleb points out that Joshua was probably still awake when Rafe arrived at the villa. When Alison asks Caleb how he relieves stress, he replies that sex is normally a good way. Joshua wakes up from the nightmare, trapping Rafe inside his mind. While Rafe screams, Joshua tries to understand why he has an excruciating headache. When an amused Ian finds Lucy searching the hospital room for her clothes, he admits to hiding them from her. Casey overhears them talking about Lucy's dream of visiting Morocco someday. When Ian takes Lucy to the roof for fresh air, they find a Moroccan paradise waiting for them. After Jamal douses the outside of Elixir with gasoline, Frank stops him from torching the club. Casey saves Jamal from Frank's wrath. Joshua's doctor, who is also a vampire, prescribes a good feeding to cure Joshua's headache. Rafe plays mind games on the fully conscious head vampire, whose hallucinations knock him off his feet. Afterward, Rafe lies unconscious outside the villa. Against Caleb's wishes, Alison tries to leave the catacombs. Caleb carries her back, kicking and screaming. Alison agrees to stay, but she leaves when Caleb's guard is down. Caleb thinks about letting her go, but changes his mind and runs after her."

        "Casey: Jamal -- Jamal. My God. Jamal? Jamal, wake up! Jamal!",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Jamal: Case --",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's me.",
        "Jamal: Oh, my head.",
        "Casey: What -- what happened?",
        "Jamal: Ah! I was going after Livvie, and somebody -- somebody must have clocked me from behind.",
        "Casey: What were -- what are you thinking, going after a vampire by yourself? Jamal, are you crazy?",
        "Jamal: Casey, innocent people are dying, like Ali, ok?",
        "Casey: No, no, whoa, whoa! Where are you going?",
        "Jamal: I'm going to go stop them. I'm going to go stop all of them, that's where I'm going.",
        "Casey: Look, I -- Jamal, I told you it's not that easy, ok?",
        "Jamal: How do you know?",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Jamal: Casey, you never even try. And maybe if you did, you might be able to help somebody for a change.",
        "Casey: Oh, what, well, you don't think I want to? Well, you try doing this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe should really be back by now.",
        "Caleb: Don't go getting all paranoid. It's just taking a little longer than we thought.",
        "Alison: Well, how long can it possibly take?",
        "Caleb: You're forgetting Joshua's a vampire. They tend to be up when the moon's out.",
        "Alison: Right. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure he probably just hasn't had a chance to get into his dreams yet, right?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.",
        "Alison: Still, I just -- I don't know, I can't help but --",
        "Caleb: What, you don't think he's up to it, do you?",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Caleb: You're acting like you don't think Rafe can handle Joshua.",
        "Alison: Oh, no, Rafe can handle Joshua. He's a slayer. He can handle anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What's going on?",
        "Joshua: What a nightmare. Oh. My head is pounding.",
        "Rafe: Ok. I got into Joshua's head. I got the antidote. Now it is time to get the hell out of here. What's going on? Why can't I do this? All right, it was tough to get in. Stands to reason it'll be tough to get out. Just focus. Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.",
        "Rafe: What the hell was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Oh, where are they? Where could they have put my clothes? Oh! Ian?",
        "Ian: Yeah, it's Ian.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Ian: What are you doing?",
        "Lucy: Uh -- excuse me?",
        "Ian: What are you doing?",
        "Lucy: Well, I was going to water -- what was the question?",
        "[Ian laughs]",
        "Ian: Lucy, I'm --",
        "Lucy: Ok, you know what I was doing. I was looking for my clothes. I want to get out of here. I can't stand to just lay in that bed knowing I have so many things I need to do. You know --",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. Like what?",
        "Lucy: \"Like what?\" You know like what. I've got to try and find out what happened to Rafe and Alison, we have to deprogram Victor. I have to go save that beautiful church, and we have to save the whole entire town from that monster Joshua. That's what we have to do right now.",
        "Ian: Is that it?",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah. I mean -- no. Then after all that, I will rest, I will take it easy, but I'm feeling better --",
        "Ian: No, not -- no, no, no, no. Not then. Now. You're going to go to bed right now. What do I have to do, handcuff you to it?",
        "Lucy: Where did you get that idea? I guess you kind of got that handcuff idea from me.",
        "Ian: You're not out of the woods yet.",
        "Lucy: I am. I feel fine. That blood transfusion is working --",
        "Ian: For now.",
        "Lucy: Well, for now is all I have right now. So for now, that's what I'm taking. I need my clothes. Where do you think they could have put my clothes?",
        "Ian: I took them.",
        "Lucy: You what?",
        "Ian: No, I don't mean I took them -- I -- I took them and I hid them. Now it's time for you to go to bed.",
        "Lucy: I'm not getting -- look at you! Look at you pushing me around some sort of big, brawny bully!",
        "Ian: Bully is it? How old are you, 8?",
        "Lucy: Hey, you are not the boss of me. You cannot make me get back in that bed if I don't want to get back in bed, so I'm not getting back in that bed.",
        "Ian: What do you think? Do you think I like this? You think I like putting you in bed like that? Do you think I really like that? What I would like is to take you out of this crazy town and put you on the first plane to Morocco.",
        "Lucy: Morocco.",
        "Ian: Or wherever, you know.",
        "Lucy: No, you -- you just -- you said Morocco. How did you come up with that out of thin air?",
        "Ian: You had mentioned that you want to go there someday.",
        "Lucy: I mentioned that a very, very long time ago, and you remembered?",
        "Ian: I remember everything you say to me.",
        "Lucy: Pardon me? What'd you say?",
        "Ian: I remember everything you say to me.",
        "Lucy: Do you know how much I would like to get on a plane, head to Morocco, and just be with you there? I would have given anything.",
        "Ian: So let's do that, but not now. Now you need to get in here and rest.",
        "Lucy: No, I don't -- no, you can't sweet-talk me any more with that Morocco stuff, then. I'm not getting back in that bed. I can't. I will go completely nuts. Could we just maybe go in the cafeteria? You could buy me, like, a -- I don't know -- a candy bar or something?",
        "Ian: I have a better idea. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: It's not going to help.",
        "Alison: What? What's not going to help?",
        "Caleb: Worrying, pacing. Just stop it.",
        "Alison: I will stop when Rafe gets back, ok? I mean, you do think that he's coming back, don't you?",
        "Caleb: What do you want? Some kind of fake reassurances that no harm will ever come to him?",
        "Alison: Yeah, that might be kind of nice at a time like this, if you don't mind.",
        "Caleb: Ok. Rafe's a smart guy. He's a decent fighter. I'm sure he can handle whatever demons are in Joshua's head, no problem.",
        "Alison: \"No problem.\" I almost believed you there for a second. You really like picking on me, don't you?",
        "Caleb: It helps pass the time.",
        "Alison: Don't even pretend like you're not worried. I know you're stressed out worried about Livvie.",
        "Caleb: I don't deny that.",
        "Alison: Fine. I'll stop pacing. You got any advice? How do you relieve stress?",
        "Caleb: Normally? Sex is good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Oh! Oh, just ignore them. You're just in Joshua's head. You're just inside Joshua's head. They're dark forces, just dark forces trying to take away your focus, but you can't let them. You can't let them. Rafe, you got to find a way out. You got to find a way out.",
        "Joshua: God. This headache. Ah. It's like someone's pounding inside my brain with a sledgehammer. I just have to relax.",
        "Rafe: Come on! Come on! No, come on, there's got to be a way out of here! Joshua, let me out! Let me out of here! Yes, there's got to be. There's got -- could it be? Yes! I got an idea.",
        "[Rafe laughs]",
        "Rafe: There's only one problem. It'll either work or it'll kill me.",

        "[Music plays]",
        "Lucy: Why are we on the roof? There aren't any candy bars up on the roof, and I --",
        "Ian: Ah.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh. Oh -- this is so amazing! I'm -- I'm standing on sand! How in the world did you have time to do this?",
        "Ian: I -- I didn't.",
        "Lucy: Oh, right, you didn't. You just happened to mention Morocco, that you wished we were there, and some little fairy made this all happen? I don't think so. Oh!",
        "Casey: Something like that.",
        "Lucy: Oh!",
        "Ian: Wow.",
        "Lucy: Oh. This is so amazing. This is like being in some kind of movie or something.",
        "Ian: Something.",
        "Lucy: Look at this place. Look at all the colors and the candles and -- mmm, it smells so good, and that music. Yeah, it's not just romantic. It's kind of decadent, too.",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: It's like some sort of servant in a little loincloth is going to walk out and start pouring us wine out --",
        "Ian: We don't need the little servants --",
        "Lucy: Oh, no?",
        "Ian: So much, no.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "Ian: But it's -- it's here. We might as well enjoy it, if only for a little while, I guess, right?",
        "Lucy: You better be careful because you're starting to sound like me.",
        "Ian: You deserve this, right.",
        "Lucy: No, no, no. We deserve this.",
        "Ian: So what do you think? The world's problems are going to be here when we get back, so why don't we escape for a while and just not think about anything else but this.",
        "Lucy: God, that sounds wonderful -- just two normal -- sort of normal people on a date?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Ian: In a Moroccan tent on the roof of the hospital.",
        "[Ian and Lucy chuckle]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: This is for you, babe. I'm sorry what they did to you. Yeah. That's right. You're going to burn, you monsters. You're all going to burn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You didn't shock me, and I wouldn't sleep with you on a bet.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, right.",
        "Alison: I heard that.",
        "Caleb: I wasn't asking to sleep with you.",
        "Alison: Hey, stop playing games with me.",
        "Caleb: Oh, take it easy.",
        "Alison: No, don't tell me to take it easy, because the man that I love is out there in some maniac's head and hasn't come back yet, and I think I have a little right to be concerned, thanks!",
        "Caleb: What, where are you going?",
        "Alison: I'm going to go see Rafe for myself.",
        "Caleb: You can't do -- you can't do that.",
        "Alison: Watch me.",
        "Caleb: No, no, you are supposed to be dead.",
        "Alison: I need to go find Rafe.",
        "Caleb: Rafe -- he's at the villa, all right, the one place you absolutely cannot go. Have you forgotten that this whole thing is about saving you from Joshua?",
        "Alison: I don't really care. The plan has changed now. And I don't care if people see that I'm alive. That's great. I didn't really want my friends and family crying over me anyway.",
        "Caleb: Think about this. Think about it for one minute.",
        "Alison: I already have. My mind is made up. I'm leaving. You can stay or you can come with me, but I'm going.",
        "Caleb: I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you. Do you understand me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Well, doctor, what is it?",
        "Doctor: I can't find a thing wrong.",
        "Joshua: Well, that's impossible. My head feels like it's about to explode. I've never felt this bad, not even when I was mortal.",
        "Doctor: Perhaps it was just too much cheer.",
        "Joshua: Oh, do you really think so? And I didn't realize that.",
        "Doctor: I'm sure if you feed, you'll feel better in no time.",
        "[Doctor chuckles]",
        "Joshua: It's as simple as that?",
        "Doctor: Trust me. I've been treating our kind for years.",
        "Joshua: Where are you going?",
        "Doctor: To fill your prescription.",
        "Joshua: Ah.",
        "Doctor: Take two of these and call me in the morning.",
        "[Doctor laughs]",
        "Joshua: Well, girls, you heard him. Doctor's orders.",
        "Rafe: All right, Joshua. Let's see if I can beat you at your own game.",
        "Joshua: No. Get out! Get out. Go.",
        "Joshua: Oh, my God. What is happening to me? Oh.",
        "Joshua: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Lucy: It's heaven. It's just heaven, that's all.",
        "Ian: Not exactly your normal date, huh?",
        "Lucy: Hmm. Uh-uh. You know, I don't think that we have done anything normal since we've been together. Well -- wait a minute. Do you realize we never had a very, you know, first date?",
        "Ian: You're right. Well, you know -- I was waiting for someone to walk in. What are you thinking?",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Ian: Maybe we'll make this our first date.",
        "Lucy: Ok, if this is our first date, I'm going to be spoiled rotten.",
        "Ian: You're already spoiled.",
        "Lucy: I am not spoiled. Come on, what do you say? Let's do it. Let's pretend that this -- ahem -- this is our very first date. What do we do?",
        "Ian: Shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Lucy: Oh, right, no.",
        "Ian: But maybe, you know, we'd get to know each other a little better.",
        "Lucy: \"Better\"?",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Lucy: Ok. What do you want to know about me?",
        "Ian: Tell me about your perfect day.",
        "Lucy: My perfect day? I don't know. With everything that's been going on, I don't -- I think it's changed. I'll tell you what it was. It used to be waking up in the morning at some luxurious spa and being pampered to death -- you know, with the seaweed wraps and the facials and all that stuff. I'd go there just to feel certain things. And now I could probably just go there to get some peace.",
        "Ian: At's it?",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. Are you kidding? Then I would go on the Concorde to Paris and I would do some Olympic-caliber shopping, and then I'd meet for dinner and dancing with a very sexy, hunky French guy.",
        "Ian: French guy?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Oh, did I say French?",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Lucy: No. Oh, no. I meant sexy Irish guy. Irish.",
        "Ian: Ok, that's better, because the French are going to end up stealing your makeup.",
        "Lucy: No --",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: That's not true.",
        "Ian: It's true.",
        "Lucy: What about you? What would be your absolutely perfect day?",
        "Ian: Any day spent with you and Danny.",
        "Lucy: Oh, come on. That's not fair. I would say you and Serena and Christina. I thought you meant someone else. Come on, what? What? Tell me, tell me.",
        "Ian: Well, that's it. But maybe I'll tell you a memorable story about a memorable day in my life.",
        "Lucy: Ok. I bet it wasn't at some spa.",
        "Ian: No, it wasn't. Ethiopia.",
        "Lucy: Ethiopia?",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. I was working there, and I -- I ran into these baboons. And they were wild, you know, really wild. They'd never seen anyone before.",
        "Lucy: But they saw you?",
        "Ian: Oh, yeah, they saw me, and I came out of the brush. I didn't mean to scare them, but I did, and they were just there, a whole bunch of them.",
        "Lucy: So what happened?",
        "Ian: Well, they took off running as fast as they could, and they -- they hurled themselves over a cliff.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God.",
        "Ian: Yeah, that's what I thought, until I went and looked over the cliff, and guess what I saw.",
        "Lucy: I don't think I want to know. You saw a bunch of squished dead baboons?",
        "Ian: No. They were fine. They were just hanging there on branches and bushes and just whatever they could find, just waiting for me to leave, and it was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen.",
        "Lucy: That really is amazing.",
        "Ian: Yeah. And then it just -- it taught me something about trust and survival, and I've never forgotten it.",
        "Lucy: Wow. They took sort of a leap of faith, huh? But how did they know?",
        "Ian: They didn't know. They just trusted that it would be all right, and it was.",
        "Lucy: Certainly not a day at the spa.",
        "Ian: It's different.",
        "Lucy: I guess we're really different, too, aren't we?",
        "Ian: What's going on in that head of yours?",
        "Lucy: I was just thinking. Do you ever wonder about us? I mean, do you ever really wonder if this -- you know, you and me -- if it's real?",
        "Ian: Well, it seems real to me. How about you?",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I don't want to fight you, man. We've always been pals.",
        "Jamal: Not anymore, Frank.",
        "Frank: I know you're upset about Alison, but take my advice and go home before you get hurt.",
        "Jamal: Frank, you can't stop me. This vampire club is going down.",
        "Frank: I said go home, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Make me, Frank.",
        "Frank: I didn't want to do this, Jamal, but you leave me no choice.",
        "Casey: Leave him alone, Frank!",
        "Jamal: Casey, get out of here. I don't need you fighting my battles.",
        "Casey: I told you I'm going to help, so I'm helping.",
        "Jamal: Well, I don't need your help, not now.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, that's too bad because I'm not leaving here without you.",
        "Frank: Better do what the angel says, Jamal. You're not going to torch this place, not tonight.",
        "Jamal: You tell your buddies that they might think that they've won, but they haven't. And eventually I'm going to be the one to show them that.",

        "Alison: Get off me!",

        "Alison: Put me down now!",
        "Caleb: Stop! No! No, listen to me.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God.",
        "Caleb: Listen, listen to me. Understand? Listen to me. I am not letting you go out there and ruin this for everybody, all right? Not just for me, not just for Olivia, but for you and Rafe. Do you understand me? Now, listen, I am not letting go of you again until you promise me you are not leaving here. Promise me!",
        "Alison: Ok. My bad. I'm sorry. I will stay.",
        "Caleb: Thank you.",
