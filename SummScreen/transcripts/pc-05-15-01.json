        "Granya: What did you decide? ",
        "Ian: Not tonight. ",
        "Granya: Well, you've got to make a move. ",
        "Ian: I'm not in the mood for games. ",
        "Granya: Well, I am. So to keep it interesting, tonight -- tonight we'll up \r\nthe stakes. ",
        "Ian: What are we playing for? ",
        "Granya: How about the truth? Tell me about Eve. ",
        "",
        "Eve: What are you doing here? ",
        "Michael: Sitting, watching the moon. Just wanted to make sure you got \r\nback in one piece. ",
        "Eve: Really? Anything else? ",
        "Michael: I know how easy it is to get lost out there. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, well, I found my way. ",
        "Michael: Ok. Look, I -- I didn't want to make you nervous. Maybe the \r\ndirections helped? ",
        "Eve: They didn't hurt, thank you. ",
        "Michael: All right. Well, now that I see you got home ok, I'll -- I'll be \r\nheading back. ",
        "Eve: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You have some kind of nasty scratches on your \r\narm there. ",
        "Michael: I'm sort of restoring this historic building. I guess I get a little \r\nclumsy sometimes. ",
        "Eve: Well, maybe you better let me take a look at those just to be on the \r\nsafe side. ",
        "Michael: \"To be on the safe side?\" ",
        "Eve: I have some antibacterial inside. Why don't you come in? ",
        "Michael: Out here, it may not be such a good idea just to invite a complete \r\nstranger into your home. ",
        "Eve: You know what? You're right. Good night. ",
        "Eve: Hey. Look. I'm a doctor. You got to trust me on this. I know what I'm \r\ndoing. That looks like it could be infected. Will you come in and let me take a \r\nlook at that? ",
        "Michael: You really think that -- ",
        "Eve: Yeah, I do. ",
        "Michael: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Carolyn! No! ",
        "[Car screeches] ",
        "Frank: Oh. Oh, my God. Carolyn? ",
        "Man: Is she ok? ",
        "Frank: I wanted to warn you. ",
        "Man: I never saw her. I swear she came out of nowhere. ",
        "Frank: Just get on your cell phone and call for help! ",
        "Man: Ok -- my what? ",
        "Frank: A pay phone, any phone! Just go, move! Get an ambulance! ",
        "Man: All right. ",
        "Frank: Carolyn. Carolyn. Listen, if you can hear me, open your eyes. Open \r\nyour eyes, squeeze my hand, anything. Oh. Oh. Listen to me. You just hang on, \r\nok? Just hang -- help's on the way. Oh. I am so sorry. With all my heart, I wish \r\nthis didn't have to happen. I wish to God I didn't know this was the day that \r\nyou had to die. Carolyn, don't -- don't, don't move. ",
        "[Carolyn moans] ",
        "Frank: Don't -- don't talk. ",
        "Carolyn: How is -- ",
        "Frank: Is she what? What? ",
        "Carolyn: No -- ",
        "Frank: Save your breath. ",
        "Carolyn: Oh, no. ",
        "Frank: Shh. ",
        "Carolyn: You have to tell me. How did you know this was going to happen? Who \r\nare you? ",
        "",
        "Ian: What are you bringing up Lambert for? ",
        "Granya: She seems to be on your mind. ",
        "Ian: Well, she is. ",
        "Granya: And why do you think that is? ",
        "Ian: You're not going to give me a break here, are you? ",
        "Granya: When have I ever? ",
        "Ian: She asked me to go away with her. ",
        "Granya: And you passed on happiness again? I warned you about that, Ian. ",
        "Ian: I had no choice. ",
        "Granya: You always have a choice! ",
        "Ian: I gave my word! I promised Arianna I would be with her. ",
        "Granya: To the bitter end, which is why instead of being happy and being with \r\nEve, you came back to Arianna. ",
        "Ian: She's sick, she's scared, and she needs me. Why do I even bother talking \r\nto you? ",
        "Granya: Because you think you've got no one else! That's why I'm here, isn't \r\nit? Oh, the great St. Ian -- when are you going to get over yourself? You're \r\njust one man, trying to do the work of a whole army. Well, you better cut \r\nyourself some slack before you lose the war and the woman you love. ",
        "",
        "Michael: You really are a doctor. ",
        "Eve: What was your first clue? ",
        "Michael: \"Lacerations.\" ",
        "[Eve laughs] ",
        "Eve: So you're restoring some cabin out here? ",
        "Michael: Historic building. ",
        "Eve: Really? What kind? ",
        "Michael: The old kind. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Michael: You came up all this way on your own? ",
        "Eve: Yes. I'm not one of those weak females who can't take care of \r\nthemselves. ",
        "Michael: Oh, I didn't think you were. How long are you planning on staying?\r\n",
        "Eve: Uh, I'm not sure. All right. You're all done. ",
        "Michael: I -- I appreciate it. Maybe I can return the favor sometime. ",
        "Eve: No. That's not necessary, really. ",
        "Michael: You sure? I'm a pretty good cook. ",
        "Eve: Look, I came up here so that I could get away from everything. ",
        "Michael: I understand. I'll -- I'll be on my way. Oh -- hey, you do have one \r\nof those cell phones, right? ",
        "Eve: Why, yes, I do. And I know how to use it, too. ",
        "Michael: Ok. Well, just in case you are a long way from anybody -- and if you \r\nneed a neighbor, I'm probably the closest. ",
        "Eve: Thanks, neighbor. ",
        "Michael: Hey. Remember to lock this. ",
        "Eve: You really don't think I can take care of myself, do you? ",
        "Michael: Just take my advice. ",
        "Eve: And you'll feel better in the morning? ",
        "Michael: Yeah. Thanks, Doc. ",
        "Eve: Oh, come on. All the way out here? ",
        "",
        "Carolyn: Somehow, you knew I was going to die. ",
        "Frank: Just hang on. Help is on the way. ",
        "Carolyn: There's so much I wanted to do. ",
        "Frank: Please don't -- don't talk. Just try to relax, ok? ",
        "Carolyn: I -- I've left nothing. I've done nothing. ",
        "Frank: That is not true. You have done so much for Cookie. And she is your \r\nlegacy, a legacy that's going to live on. You will have a namesake. She will \r\nsave so many lives and she will look just like you, and be like you. ",
        "Carolyn: \"She?\" ",
        "Frank: A niece. You will have a niece named after you. ",
        "Carolyn: Well, tell me about her. Please. ",
        "Frank: Well, remember when Cookie was little and she would say your name so \r\nfast that it sounded like \"Karen?\" ",
        "Carolyn: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Frank: That's her name -- Karen. ",
        "[Distant sirens] ",
        "Frank: Your niece. She will have your dream, Carolyn. She will have your \r\ndream, and she will see it through. She's a doctor. She'll be a doctor. And I \r\nwill fall in love with her with all my heart. ",
        "[Sirens approach] ",
        "Frank: Karen will love and remember you her whole life. She'll never forget \r\n-- that's a promise. We will always remember you, Carolyn -- always. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I promised Arianna I'd take care of her, and now she's in there this \r\nclose to dying. ",
        "Granya: Haven't you heard, Ian? You can't always control who lives and who \r\ndies. ",
        "Ian: I'm not in control of anything. Eve needs me -- I'm not there for her. \r\nAnd then there's Frank Scanlon -- put his life on the line for Arianna and for \r\nme. ",
        "Granya: People make their own choices, can and will, without help from you, \r\nand it happens every day. ",
        "Ian: But I'm a doctor. I'm supposed to help and protect people. I was \r\nsupposed to protect you. ",
        "Granya: You've got to stop saying that. I had the most wonderful brother in \r\nthe world -- a man who put everyone's happiness before his own, a man who'd walk \r\nmiles to save someone he'd never met without ever knowing how to find his way \r\nhome. You were always there to save everyone, Ian. Who's going to save you? Your \r\nlife's there for the taking. Don't stand about being stubborn! Grab it! Wrap \r\nyour arms tight around it and give it a good squeeze because you deserve it! \r\nDon't wait till the years are worn away and gone. ",
        "Ian: Just trying to make it better. ",
        "Granya: The world, you mean? Try starting a little closer to home. You have \r\nyet to fall asleep holding the woman you love in your arms. My dear brother, you \r\nare so busy saving the world. Don't you forget to save yourself. That would be \r\nsuch a waste. ",

        "Eve: Great. Great, great, great. ",
        "Eve: That's great. That's just great. ",
        "Eve: It's going to be a long night, Eve -- a long, cold night. ",

        "Frank: Your dreams are safe, Carolyn. She'll see them through. ",
        "Carolyn: Karen? ",

        "Frank: You're too late. ",
        "Paramedic: I said let us in. ",
        "Frank: I said you're too late! I know! ",

        "Paramedic: I'm not getting anything. ",
        "Second Paramedic: Let's get her to G.H. ",
        "Frank: Too late. You're too late! ",
        "Paramedic: Ok, ready? One, two -- you want to follow us back to the hospital?\r\n",
        "Frank: No. No, I know the way. ",

        "Frank: Cookie, no, don't! Don't! ",

        "Frank: The car. There's nothing anybody could've done. ",
        "Cookie: How do you know? Did you try? Did anybody try? ",
        "Frank: I was with her at the end. Believe me, believe me. She was gone before \r\nthey got here. ",
        "Cookie: No! No! No! This isn't true! This can't be happening. I was supposed \r\nto meet her at Kelly's. If I'd only have shown up, we'd still be there! We'd \r\nstill be laughing. I could have saved her! ",
        "Frank: No, listen. Cookie. Cookie, some things just happen. You couldn't have \r\nstopped this from happening. Do you hear me? No one could -- no one! ",
        "",
        "Granya: In the end, all your sorrow and sacrifice won't mean half as much as \r\na bit of happiness, Ian. ",
        "Ian: All right. What can I do? ",
        "Granya: Forgive yourself for my death, for the children you fought for in \r\nAfrica, for the few patients who have slipped through your fingers, for \r\nArianna's pain, Eve's unhappiness -- especially that. ",
        "Ian: I wonder what kind of life Eve would have with me. I've caused her so \r\nmuch pain already. ",
        "Granya: That's a part of the game. You give your heart, you give your soul, \r\nyou give yourself completely. That includes the troubles, too. And Eve knows \r\nthat because those are the rules. She's out there somewhere, your soul mate, \r\nyour much-better half. What are you going to do about it? It's still your move.\r\n",
        "",
        "Eve: All right! Thank you, Girl Scouts of America. Oh! Ooh. Yes. Now, I just \r\nneed some of those Thin Mint cookies to go with some hot chocolate. If only I'd \r\nremembered to bring Thin Mint cookies to go with the hot chocolate. ",
        "[Wind blows] ",
        "Eve: All right. Come on, Lambert. It's ok. You wanted to get away from it all \r\nand spend some quiet time in this cabin, away from it all. So that's what you \r\ngot. You got a nice cabin, a nice roaring -- well, you got a fire. And you've \r\ngot heat and light. Light, light -- more light would be good. More light. Never \r\nhave enough light. Oh, there we go. Ok. Music! Yeah! Ok. ",
        "[Turns on radio] ",
        "Eve: There we go. ",
        "Eve: Come on. What are you doing? What are you afraid of? Lambert, you're ok. \r\nIt's just a little -- a little wind, and -- and I don't know what else. I can \r\ntake care of myself. And I can take care of both of us. I can. I can and I will.\r\n",

        "Cookie: Why Carolyn? ",
        "Frank: Things just happen sometimes, and we can't change them, sweetheart, no \r\nmatter how much we want to. I know how you're feeling. ",
        "Cookie: No. No, you don't know how I'm feeling! My sister's dead because of \r\nme! ",
        "Frank: That is not true. ",
        "Cookie: But if I were to only have been there -- ",
        "Frank: Listen to me. You have got to believe that there is a plan and a \r\npurpose to it all. It makes all the difference. ",
        "Cookie: Do you believe there's a plan for why things happen the way they do?\r\n",
        "Frank: I know there is. ",
        "Cookie: How? ",
        "Frank: The same way I know your sister wouldn't want you blaming yourself, \r\nespecially when there is nothing to blame yourself for. She had peace in her \r\nheart, Cookie. Trust me -- she would want you to go on living the way she did, \r\nthe way she tried to teach you -- loving, laughing, dancing, helping where she \r\ncould. ",
        "Cookie: How do you know what she wanted? ",
        "Frank: I told you I saw it in her eyes. And I see a lot of her in you, too.\r\n",
        "Cookie: I just loved her so much. ",
        "Frank: She knows that. ",
        "Cookie: But she's gone. And I'm all alone. And I'll always be alone. ",

        "Cookie: Um -- it's Carolyn. ",
        "Man: Carolyn what? What? What happened? ",
        "Cookie: She's gone, Daddy -- like Mama. They took her to the hospital. It was a \r\ncar. ",
        "Frank: It came out of nowhere. The police will have all the information. ",
        "Cookie: I'm sorry, Daddy. She's dead. ",
        "Man: No! ",
        "Cookie: Carolyn's -- ",
        "Man: No! Now how the hell did this happen? Now -- what happened? ",
        "Cookie: Daddy, I don't know! I didn't see it! I wasn't here! ",
        "Man: Now, you two were supposed to be together. You said you were going to \r\nmeet at Kelly's. ",
        "Cookie: I got held up. ",
        "Man: So she was alone? ",
        "Cookie: Yes. But I didn't know, Daddy. Please. ",

        "Man: We got to go to the hospital and see my baby and say goodbye. ",
