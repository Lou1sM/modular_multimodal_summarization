        "Jack: And also the wrench. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. ",
        "Jack: Ow. Ow. ",
        "Livvie: God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Let me get some ice. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, you need to get some ice for -- ",
        "Jack: No, what I need is for you to give yourself a break, all right, Livvie? \r\nYou made a mistake. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, a huge one. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but so what? Let it go. You have to let it go and put it behind \r\nyou. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. I'll try, ok? ",
        "Jack: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, what's the story on the bike, man? The owner's going to be here in \r\nabout 10. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm almost done, bro. ",
        "Jamal: All right, cool. ",
        "Jack: Where you been? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, man, over at that dump, the Artery, dude. ",
        "Jack: Oh, that's the bar where Sam and Zach hang out. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, Zach wanted to talk strategy, like he knows anything else but \r\nfixing races. ",
        "Livvie: I just -- I still can't believe that you have to race because of what \r\nI did. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you didn't mean to erase the tape, ok, so don't even bother \r\nsweating it. ",
        "Jack: He's right. There's nothing we can do about it now. Hey, check this \r\nout, man. This might need to be replaced. ",
        "Livvie: I just wish there was something more I could do. ",
        "Jack: Right there. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, you know -- um -- Jack, I have a couple of errands to run, and \r\nI'll be back soon. ",
        "Jack: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Victor told me that Mary's come by here on some pretext or another \r\nevery day since Frank left. I think she's hoping for some news on him from Joe.\r\n",
        "Lucy: So she actually really bought into his vacation story, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Which is why we have to be careful. I don't want to upset her. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Ok, I can be subtle. I can. Subtle's my middle name today. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, subtle. Just remember the reason we're here is to follow up on \r\nwhat we found in Carolyn Wexler's file. ",
        "Lucy: Right, and moving closer to proving that Frank talked to Rhonda in 1973 \r\nand somehow changed the future. ",
        "Kevin: I'm still for sticking with logic. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, Mr. Logic, let me hear your logical explanation of this. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, there's a chance that because Carolyn died when Frank was very \r\nyoung, maybe he was out with Mary, maybe he saw the accident happen. Now, for \r\nsomeone that age to see something like that, that can really affect someone. ",
        "Lucy: So what you're saying is maybe Carolyn's face or image got stuck in \r\nFrank's brain. ",
        "Kevin: It's possible. ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, I really think that's a long shot. ",
        "Kevin: And communicating with the past isn't? ",
        "Lucy: No, there is never a wrong intuitive long shot. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I get it -- only on the logical ones. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, that's right, right. ",
        "Kevin: Now who's being unreasonable? ",
        "Lucy: You are. Listen, I am very capable of reasoning and unreasoning \r\nanything. You're not. ",
        "Kevin: Well, can we be practical for just two little minutes? ",
        "Lucy: No, because you're not talking about practicality, you're talking about \r\nskepticism. That's what you're being -- skeptical. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, listen, Doc, this isn't just some case study of Frank. I keep \r\ntelling you that. That poor man is out there in the twilight zone looking for \r\nhis girl -- his girl, the woman he loves. He has all that faith. Shouldn't that \r\ncount for something? So I think what's really important here is to start \r\nlistening to what Frank said, trust what Frank said, and maybe we're going to \r\nfinally get somewhere. ",
        "Mary: Oh, hi. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. ",
        "Kevin: Mary, hi. ",
        "Mary: What's going on? I heard you say Frank's name. Is he ok? ",
        "",
        "Frank: Karen. Oh, I am so glad to see you. Oh, I love you so much. ",
        "Karen: I love you, too. But what's going on? ",
        "Frank: I thought I'd lost you. I thought I would never see you, never, ever \r\ntouch you again. ",
        "Karen: I'm here, Frank. I'm right here. Hey, what's wrong? You look so sad.\r\n",
        "Frank: I saw your Aunt Carolyn, and she looked just like you. And I watched \r\nher die. I couldn't stop it. Karen, I tried, but I was too late. Now I'm so \r\nscared. ",
        "Karen: Of what? ",
        "Frank: That I won't be able to save you, either. If I can't get into Cookie's \r\nhouse and get to that computer, I could lose you, Karen, forever. ",
        "Karen: No, shh. ",
        "Frank: I can't lose you. ",
        "Karen: It's ok. ",
        "Frank: I can't lose you! ",
        "Karen: Shh. It's going to be ok. It's going to be ok. Can you hear me? Frank?\r\n",
        "Cookie: Can you hear me? ",
        "",
        "Sam: You must have taken a wrong turn. We don't serve muffins here. ",
        "Livvie: I know where I am, and I am not here to see you. ",
        "Sam: I'm crushed. ",
        "Livvie: Where's Zach? ",
        "Sam: Not here. Why? ",
        "Livvie: Where is he? ",
        "Sam: Well, I'll pass on whatever message you have for him. ",
        "Livvie: No, I'll wait. ",
        "Sam: Well, if you don't trust me, you could always tape what you want to say. \r\nI hear you're real good at taping over stuff. ",
        "[laughter from bystanders]",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and I hear you're not good at taking messages, like the one \r\nJack sent you when he threw you out of his bed. ",
        "[more laughter]",
        "Sam: Why don't you just go home and play house with Jackie boy?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'll go -- after I talk to Zach. ",
        "Sam: Well, that's not going to happen. ",
        "Zach: She came to see me, Sam. I'd like to hear what she has to say. ",
        "Sam: Whatever. ",
        "Zach: So what can I do for you? ",
        "Livvie: Let Jamal out of that race, and I'll make it worth your while. ",
        "",
        "Mary: You said you were listening to Frank. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, she meant listening to Frank's story. It just so happens I'm \r\ninvolved in a study right now on the imagination and how that and other -- call \r\nthem \"occurrences\" -- can seem real. ",
        "Mary: Well, but if you're talking about Frank imagining that woman, he \r\nexplained that. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, he did -- a momentary occurrence caused by over-exhaustion. ",
        "Mary: But you still don't believe that's possible? ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's just that I find the phenomenon very interesting. ",
        "Lucy: People can have images, though. They just -- They see things -- ",
        "Kevin: Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions? ",
        "Mary: No. Although I don't see how I could possibly be of any help. ",
        "Lucy: Well, it'd be like -- ",
        "Kevin: I was curious. ",
        "Lucy: Research. ",
        "Kevin: I was just curious -- did you know the Wexler family when Frank was \r\ngrowing up? ",
        "Mary: Well, they lived in the neighborhood, but Harry Wexler was not exactly \r\nsocial. ",
        "Kevin: Why was that? ",
        "Mary: Well, he was just a private person. He's an inventor -- or was -- and \r\nhe -- you know, he kept to himself. And his inventions were not successful, so I \r\nthink he was frustrated and I guess he became a pretty heavy drinker. ",
        "Kevin: Did you know Rhonda back then? ",
        "Mary: Oh, yes. She's so sweet. It's sad what's happened to her. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I understand that she had a sister named Carolyn. ",
        "Mary: That was such a tragedy. She was hit by a car. ",
        "Lucy: Mary, were you there? Did you see the accident? Was Frank there? Could \r\nhe have seen it? Was he there? ",
        "Mary: No, no, a neighbor told me about it, and Frank was way too young to \r\nunderstand. Why do you ask? ",
        "Lucy: Well -- ",
        "Kevin: Well, one theory is that a childhood trauma can kind of occur again in \r\nlater life for no apparent reason. ",
        "Mary: But if that happened, then his getting away is a good thing, right? ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Right. ",
        "Kevin: Right, I'm sure he'll feel a lot better when he gets back. ",
        "Mary: We all will. ",
        "Kevin: Well, anyway, it was great to see you, Mary. ",
        "Lucy: It really was. Tell Victor I'll call him, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. ",
        "Mary: Oh, I will. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, take care. Bye. ",
        "Kevin: Bye-bye. ",
        "Lucy: Ta! Ok, Mr. Logical Explanation, that sort of shoots that one to heck, \r\ndoesn't it? So now we do it my way. ",
        "Kevin: I'm afraid to ask. ",
        "Lucy: We are going to Rhonda's house, and we are going to see if that \r\ncomputer there can somehow connect us to 1973. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Cookie. ",
        "Cookie: I didn't mean to bother you. I was just walking by. ",
        "Frank: No, no, it's ok. Are you ok? ",
        "Cookie: I can't be at home without Carolyn. I miss her so much. ",
        "Frank: I know. ",
        "Cookie: My dad just keeps drinking. He doesn't care about anything. Oh, no. \r\nOh, no. ",
        "Frank: Oh, Cookie. ",
        "Cookie: It's Carolyn's. It's her blood. It's all my fault. It's all my fault \r\nshe's dead. ",
        "Frank: No, Cookie, don't say that. ",
        "Cookie: She loved me. She's the only person who ever did. I loved her. ",
        "Frank: I know how much it hurts to lose someone who means everything to you.\r\n",
        "Cookie: You lost someone? ",
        "Frank: A woman I loved very much. ",
        "Cookie: I'm sorry. What was her name? ",
        "Frank: Karen. Her name's Karen. What? ",
        "Cookie: When I was really little, I couldn't say \"Carolyn\" and it used to \r\ncome out \"Karen.\" And then she'd pick me up and she'd say, \"You be my little \r\nCookie, and I'll be your Karen.\" Then she'd tickle me, and I'd yell, \"Stop, \r\nstop!\" \"Not till it hurts,\" she'd say. Then finally I'd give in and say, \"It \r\nhurts.\" It hurts, Carolyn. ",
        "Frank: She would want you to have this. ",
        "Cookie: What is it? ",
        "Frank: I found it after the accident. ",
        "Cookie: It's her heart. ",
        "Frank: It will help keep her alive in yours. You'll keep her alive, Cookie, \r\nin ways you'll never expect. ",
        "Cookie: Thank you. ",
        "Frank: I can tell she was a very special person, and I'm sorry you had to \r\nlose her. ",
        "Cookie: How come you slept here last night? Don't you have a place to stay? ",
        "Frank: No, I'm -- I'm just visiting. Actually, I'm hoping to find Karen. ",
        "Cookie: So she's still alive? ",
        "Frank: Yes, yes, she's just missing. ",
        "Cookie: I'm glad you have a chance to find her. Hey, I have an idea -- why \r\ndon't you come stay at our house? ",
        "Frank: What? ",
        "Cookie: You've been so nice. And you need a place to stay, right? ",
        "Frank: You're inviting me into your home? ",
        "Cookie: We have a room in the basement where you can stay. ",
        "Frank: I don't know what to say. ",
        "Cookie: You helped my sister. Now you need help. You can come stay at my \r\nhouse until you find Karen. ",
        "Frank: Thank you. Thank you. This is just what I needed. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I'm serious, everything on this baby's got to be perfect. We're racing \r\nsome pretty gnarly terrain out there. ",
        "Jack: You know where the race is? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, a course up there by the Canadian border. Lot of steep \r\ndrop-offs, hairpin turns. Lot of action. ",
        "Jack: Sounds pretty big-time. ",
        "Jamal: It is. ",
        "Jack: How big? ",
        "Jamal: National circuit. ",
        "Jack: Whoa. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: Sounds legit. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, the race itself. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but not Zach's part in it, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Well, let's just say that I got to do whatever it takes to win. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I have access to some money. ",
        "Zach: Really? ",
        "Livvie: I can only take out so much at a time, but I can pay you a little bit \r\nevery month until you have as much as you would have made from the race. ",
        "Zach: And you'd do this for Jamal? ",
        "Livvie: Hey, I'm the one who messed up that tape. He shouldn't have to pay \r\nfor my mistakes. ",
        "Zach: So you want me to roll my business with him over to you? ",
        "Livvie: So you going to take the money? You going to let Jamal out of this?\r\n",
        "Zach: You want to deal, baby, you got to be serious. ",
        "Livvie: Let's get serious. What do you want? ",

        "Kevin: I cannot believe we've broken into Rhonda's house while she's in the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Lucy: Well, breaking and entering is good. It means no one knows what's going \r\non, nobody gets hurt. Come on, let's go. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my goodness. This looks like a complete throwback to \r\nthe 1970s. ",
        "Kevin: Revolting, isn't it? I had to drag Frank out of here a couple of days \r\nago. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, there is an incredible energy in here. Do you feel it? ",
        "Kevin: I think that's a draft. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. No, it's not. There really is something here. It's like a break in \r\ntime or a time warp or something. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, just because Rhonda hasn't updated her basement in almost 30 \r\nyears doesn't mean that we're in the twilight zone, nor does it mean that this \r\nthing -- whatever that is -- could connect to someone in 1973. ",
        "Lucy: Just stop. I thought you were getting in touch with your intuitive \r\nside. ",
        "Kevin: It jumped ship to be with my rational self a while ago. ",
        "Lucy: Very funny. Now, wait, you're the one who said you do not believe Frank \r\nis crazy. ",
        "Kevin: I don't know what Frank is going through. ",
        "Lucy: You don't. You don't even know where he is, but you let him go not \r\nknowing. Doc, you had trust, you had faith not knowing. Come on, come on, don't \r\nbackslide on me now. ",
        "Kevin: Just try what you're going to try with this thing, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok, here goes. There's got to be a plug. It's got -- ",
        "Kevin: Right there, right there. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, ok, here we go. All right, listen, if I blow up when I plug this \r\nin, I love you very much. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm so glad you didn't blow up. ",

        "Kevin: Yep. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait. All right. \"Hello. Anybody out there?\" ",
        "Kevin: Or not. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Come on, computer, come on. \"Show us what you showed Frank.\" ",
        "Kevin: This dinosaur couldn't connect to the neighbors, let alone 1973. ",
        "Lucy: Stop it. Just stop. Please stop, please. I don't want that pessimistic \r\nenergy in here. ",
        "Kevin: What energy? ",
        "Lucy: There's something in here. I -- maybe it's not that. There is \r\nsomething, though. I just -- wait a minute. ",

        "Lucy: \"Port Charles High School Yearbook, 1973.\" ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc, look at this, look at this. Look, it's Scott. That's his \r\nsenior class picture, and that's Rhonda. Look what she's done. She cut it out, \r\ntaped it right next to Scott's picture. She wrote \"Rhonda and Scotty\" in a \r\nheart, a red heart. Oh. ",

        "Kevin: I don't know! It just -- Lucy, this is all so incredible. ",
        "Lucy: It is. It really is, but it's happening, Doc, just like Frank said it \r\nwould play out. ",
