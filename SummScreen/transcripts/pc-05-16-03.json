        "After Jamal acts out in grief at the park, Casey lets it slip that Alison is alive. Thunder warns her to be careful, so she covers with an old clich\u00e9. Casey comforts her grief-stricken friend with kisses. Caleb accuses Rafe of lying, but the slayer maintains that there is no antidote. Since he tells Alison the same thing, Livvie believes him. Rafe decides it's time to be seen in public as the grieving fianc\u00e9. After Elizabeth stabs Kevin with a letter opener, she calls Ian for help. As Lucy prepares for release from the hospital, she is shocked to see Ian return with the wounded Kevin. Ian and Lucy don't believe Elizabeth's claim that Alison is dead. Kevin makes a big deal out of having his coat nearby. The idea that Caleb wrote a song for Alison fills Livvie with jealousy. Karen finds the syringe in Kevin's coat. Rafe reluctantly admits to Ian and Lucy that Alison is alive."

        "Casey: A crazy man on his way to a broken hand. Why are you taking it out on a tree?",
        "Jamal: You should've just let me torch the Elixir. It's all gone to hell, anyway. What's the difference if I flame it?",
        "Casey: You know, if you had, Rrank would have killed you, turned you into a vampire just like he is.",
        "Jamal: So what? I don't even care.",
        "Casey: So you know what? Charging head-first into the dragon's head is not going to bring Alison back, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Nothing's going to bring Alison back, Casey. I can't find her grandmother. I can't find her mother. I can't find anybody. God, am I the only one who cares?",

        "Rafe: I don't know. Maybe he feels safe because he has Caleb's ring. We all know he likes to watch people suffer. You know, you and Livvie are going to have to find another way to live happily ever after than to just start chomping on each other.",

        "Caleb: That's not what I meant. I love you, and that's the basis of everything we are. Do you remember when this was reversed, when you were mortal and I wasn't? Things were never easy for us.",
        "Alison: Caleb, being in love is never really easy.",
        "Caleb: Made all the more complicated by Rafe holding back on us.",
        "Rafe: Believe whatever you want.",
        "Alison: That's not fair. He has done every single thing that you've asked. Why would he lie to you now?",

        "Rafe: There's no antidote.",
        "Livvie: You know what? As much as I don't like him and I don't trust him, I don't think he would lie to Alison. So what do we do now?",

        "Alison: No. Why does he have to go?",

        "Livvie: That long?",
        "Rafe: I'll try to hurry, ok? and you -- you make sure Alison's safe, ok? You understand that?",

        "Rafe: I thought we were done with threats.",
        "Caleb: We're not. If Olivia suffers because you lied, it'll be payback time.",

        "Casey: Look, I know it feels like no one cares, but Alison has -- had a lot of friends.",
        "Jamal: Then how come nobody protected her? I should've known about Livvie. I should've done something. I should've just known something.",
        "Casey: Ok, look, everything happens for a reason, all right? One day soon, you're going to figure out that there was a reason for all of this. Trust.",
        "Jamal: Look at you, spouting cliches like it's going to fix something. I can't just let it go and accept this. Alison was something real to me.",
        "Casey: Look, I know she --",
        "Jamal: No, you don't know! Stop saying -- you don't know! You don't know anything. Alison is dead. Jack's a complete stranger. That idiot Ricky's -- he's an idiot. Then there's The Recovery Room. Look -- I used to live in there, that used to be my home, and now it looks like some bogeyman's nightmare. everything has gone to complete hell, and the only person I have to unload on isn't even real.",
        "Casey: No, I'm real.",
        "Jamal: You know what I'm saying, Casey. I don't know why I'm here, how I got here or anything. I can't even tell my best friend because she's dead.",

        "Karen: Well, it is good to see you're feeling so much better. one less thing to worry about.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Thanks. I'm fine. It's just a lot of very bad things have been happening to a lot of good people that I care a lot about, you know? Ian should be back. He was going to take me home. I -- maybe I should call him because --",
        "Karen: Don't bother.",
        "Lucy: What in the world --",
        "Colleen: Dr. Collins, are you all right?",
        "Kevin: Relative to what? Bad news, Lucy. It looks like I'm going to make it.",

        "Kevin: No, I was too busy trying not to bleed.",
        "Karen: Lungs sound clear.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, she missed. I mean, this hurts like hell, but, you know, other than that - -- ah. great. Could you just put that over there? No -- uh-uh -- over there. Thank you.",
        "Karen: Well, you're right. This is your lucky day. You could've been a lot worse.",

        "Lucy: Well, it's not. I mean, I don't believe that. I would know if she was dead. Alison's not dead. I -- I don't -- I don't believe that. I still don't believe it. She's not -- give me that. It isn't true. She's not -- she's not dead. This can't be real. This is -- this is --",
        "Ian: Sit down, sit down.",
        "Lucy: I'm fine. It's not true, that's all. It's not real. It's simply not real.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: That's not right, what Joshua did to your grandmother.",
        "Alison: Yeah, thanks. You know, for what it's worth, I'm sorry that you and Caleb can't be together the way that you would've hoped. It's kind of weird, you and I sitting here feeling sorry for each other.",
        "Livvie: Yeah. It's very weird. I was supposed to give Caleb his power back. It might be the most important thing I've ever had to do. And now I can't.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe he can, you know, get used to not exactly being normal, but at least not being a vampire.",
        "Livvie: Really? Guess what, Alison. I am a vampire.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and I'm -- I'm sorry. That's probably very insensitive and -- and obvious. I shouldn't have said that. Hey, Caleb -- do you need something to keep you busy? Why don't you go ahead and write another lyric to another song or something?",
        "Caleb: Yeah.",
        "Livvie: You were writing lyrics here?",
        "Caleb: I kind of had to stand up to this challenge.",

        "Jamal: Casey, tell me -- what do you mean, she isn't dead?",
        "Casey: Hey, don't get in my face like that. Jamal --",
        "Jamal: You said Alison wasn't dead. What do you mean?",
        "Casey: Ok, what -- oh, man. All right, what I'm saying is --",

        "Casey: Ok. Point made.",
        "Jamal: Look, Casey, you better spill it right now.",
        "Casey: Ok -- what I'm saying, Jamal, is that no one ever really dies. Ok, people may be gone, but they live on inside of us.",
        "Jamal: More cliches. You're a real piece of work.",
        "Casey: Ok. Tell me what you want me -- how can I help you? What do you want me to do?",
        "Jamal: Nothing. just get lost.",

        "Alison: Well, I sort of forced him to do it, kind of.",
        "Caleb: She called me a fake. I couldn't let her get away with that.",
        "Alison: I thought that he really was a fake, but he rose to the challenge, and he's actually very talented. I was surprised --",
        "Livvie: Oh, gee, thank you for sharing that with me.",
        "Caleb: Hey. You know, I keep all my best stuff for you.",
        "Livvie: Is that so?",

        "Rafe: You saw the photograph, huh?",
        "Ian: What happened?",
        "Rafe: Well, you know how irrational Livvie can be. She's always blaming Alison for everything that goes wrong in her life. So she decided, you know, to bite her -- Alison didn't stand a chance.",

        "Rafe: Where's who?",
