        "Harry: You've got no right to be here. She's only 16 years old. ",
        "Frank: I can explain. ",
        "Cookie: Daddy, I asked him here. ",
        "Harry: What? Your sister's just died. So, what, you're out sneaking around \r\nwith a man twice your age? ",
        "Frank: That is not true. ",
        "Cookie: Frank's my friend, Daddy. He was there. Don't you remember when \r\nCarolyn was -- ",
        "Harry: Shut up. You're the reason she's gone. You're the one who killed her.\r\n",
        "Frank: No, that is not true at all. ",
        "Harry: You made plans to meet. You canceled, so she left. ",
        "Cookie: Dad, don't. ",
        "Harry: So, that's when she got hit. She's dead! And it is your fault. It's \r\nall your fault. ",

        "Chris: Oh, it's a megaburger at the Recovery Room. ",
        "Eve: Oh, that sounds warm. ",
        "Chris: I had them cook it this time, you know. Call me crazy. Hey, I've been \r\nthinking about you. How you doing? ",
        "Eve: Besides cold, damp, and shivering -- ",
        "Chris: Where'd you go? Antarctica? ",
        "Eve: I'm kind of beginning to think so. ",
        "Chris: You sound tired. ",
        "Eve: Only because I've been up all night. ",
        "Chris: Aha. Thinking about me? ",
        "Eve: I'm sorry, Ramsey. I've been too busy listening to all the spooky noises \r\noutside to give you a second thought. Remind me never to rent a cabin again. ",
        "Chris: What cabin did you rent, Abraham Lincoln's? Hey, where are you, \r\nanyway? ",
        "Eve: I'm not going to tell you that, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Why not? ",
        "Eve: That's a good point, you know. Ok, but I'll tell you only if you promise \r\nnot to come running up here. ",
        "Chris: Oh, after you made it sound so inviting? ",
        "Eve: It's the Johnson cabin just off the county road that crosses the west \r\nridge. ",
        "Chris: How'd you find that place? ",
        "Eve: Uh, I've been here before. Only before, it seemed more magical. ",
        "Chris: The good old days, right? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Hey, speaking of the good old days, um -- have you seen Ian? ",
        "Chris: Who? ",
        "Eve: Come on, Ramsey. I just want to know how he is. And I also want to know \r\nif you've heard any news about Arianna. ",

        "Eve: Oh. I guess he's been spending a lot of time at home these days, huh?\r\n",

        "Frank: Don't listen to him, Cookie. ",
        "Harry: You bring nothing but heartache wherever you go, ever since you poked \r\nyour sorry way into this world. My Carolyn, she had so much. She could have done \r\nsuch great -- ",
        "Cookie: Daddy? ",
        "Harry: Why did it have to be Carolyn? Why her? Why couldn't it -- ",
        "Cookie: Have been me? That's what you mean. You think everything's always my \r\nfault, isn't it, Daddy? You still blame me for Mom dying, too! ",
        "Harry: Don't you raise your voice to me. ",
        "Cookie: If she hadn't have had me, she'd still be alive. That's what you \r\nthink. I killed her and now Carolyn. I'm responsible. You wish it were me that \r\ndied, Daddy. You wish that I had gotten hit, not Carolyn. Well, so do I, Daddy. \r\nAre you happy now? I wish to God it had been me. I wish to God. ",

        "Livvie: I was out of -- ",

        "Harry: Who the hell are you to tell me anything, smart boy? What the hell are \r\nyou doing down here with my underage daughter, anyway? Maybe I ought to call the \r\ncops and tell them all about it. Let me give them a call right now. ",

        "Ian: Right. But the timing's good now? Has she lost all self-respect? ",
        "Chris: You know, I've learned something. It's not every day that a man finds \r\nsomebody that he wants to spend the rest of his life with. ",
        "Ian: True enough, Ramsey. True enough. Um -- well, I wish you happiness, both \r\nof you. ",
        "Chris: Thank you. I appreciate that. You know something? I just bet you would \r\nlove her. ",
        "Ian: Is that right? Well, maybe one day I'll meet her. I want to apologize \r\nfor the wisecrack. If a man is lucky enough to meet a woman he can spend the \r\nrest of his life with, he's blessed indeed. Hold onto her. Don't let her slip \r\naway. ",

But she will do anything it takes to make you happy. \r\nThat means raising you with a dad. And I know that Chris isn't perfect, but one \r\nthing's for sure -- he'll always, always, always put us first. So there's no \r\nreason for us not to say yes to him, right? Right. Ok. Hey. ",
