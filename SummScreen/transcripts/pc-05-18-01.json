        "Eve: You brought all this food. The least you can do is share some of it with \r\nme. ",
        "Michael: It's getting late. I should be going. ",
        "Eve: And? ",
        "Michael: And I won't be able to find the trail of bread crumbs I left to find \r\nmy way home? ",
        "Eve: Look, I decided to leave, so, what, we're going to just let all this \r\ngreat food go to waste? ",
        "Michael: Well, I never could stand the idea of wasted food. ",
        "Eve: Great. I'll set the table. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Fingers crossed. ",
        "Kevin: Fingers crossed. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Kevin: Wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Lucy: What? What? ",
        "Kevin: Don't you think we should discuss how we're going to do this first?\r\n",
        "Lucy: What is there to discuss? ",
        "Kevin: You don't think Scott's going to wonder why we're grilling him on \r\nRhonda Wexler? ",
        "Lucy: We just tell him. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, right. What was I thinking? \"Scott, you know, you may have a \r\ndaughter with Rhonda Wexler, but she was accidentally erased because Frank \r\nScanlon -- well, he got caught up in a time warp with a teenaged Rhonda back in \r\n1973.\" ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I get your point. So we calmly, slowly, gradually ease into a very \r\ncalm explanation. ",
        "Kevin: You know, I still think the fewer people that know, the less chance \r\nwe'll have of being committed to Ferncliff. ",
        "Lucy: All right, we need a plan. We need an idea, some sort of excuse or \r\nsomething. ",
        "Kevin: I got it. Oh, this is going to be great. ",
        "Lucy: Do you care to fill me in on what it is? ",
        "Kevin: Just follow my lead, but remember be cool. ",
        "Lucy: Cool. ",
        "Kevin: Cool. ",
        "Lucy: All right. ",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Kevin: Hi. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. ",
        "Scott: Hiya, lovebirds. What, did I goof up on Serena's schedule again? ",
        "Lucy: No, that was last week. No, this -- I'm actually -- no -- not here to \r\npick up Serena right now. ",
        "Scott: Just a visit? ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Sort of, yeah. ",
        "Scott: Well, come on in. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, great. Thanks, Scott. ",
        "Scott: Serena's upstairs. Supposed to be doing her homework, but I bet she's \r\nreading her scuba diving magazines. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Scott: Um, are you guys going to want some fish sticks? ",
        "Kevin: Not me, thank you. ",
        "Scott: Oh, good. ",
        "Lucy: I want one. I -- thank you. Listen, actually, I would love to see \r\nSerena later. It's just we're not really here to see her per se. We're here sort \r\nof just to have a nice visit with you. ",
        "Scott: What kind of trouble you in again, Lucy? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, no. No, no. She hasn't done anything, for once. It's just that --\r\n",
        "Lucy: Look, Scott, we need to hear everything you know about Rhonda Wexler. \r\nIt's very, very important. In fact, it's a matter of life and death. ",
        "",
        "Frank: How long have you known the Wexlers? ",
        "Mary: I don't think you should go around there anymore, Frank. As I told you, \r\nHarry Wexler is a very unpredictable man. ",
        "Frank: I know, I know, and I'll try to steer clear of him, but -- ",
        "Mary: But what? ",
        "Frank: But I have to go back there, to the Wexlers'. ",
        "Mary: To find this girl? The one you're in love with? Are they the only way \r\nyou can find her? ",
        "Frank: They're part of the way, yeah. ",
        "Mary: What? ",
        "Frank: You don't happen to have some more iced tea, do you? ",
        "Mary: You're changing the subject. ",
        "Frank: True, but I really am thirsty. ",
        "Mary: Are you sure we never met before yesterday? ",
        "Frank: Pretty sure. Why? ",
        "Mary: Because there's something you're not telling me, and I think I know \r\nwhat it is. ",
        "Frank: What do you mean? ",
        "Mary: You're not who you say you are. ",
        "",
        "Eve: It's hot chocolate. I hope you don't mind. ",
        "Michael: That's fine. ",
        "Eve: Wow. That's an unusual ring. ",
        "Michael: My father gave it to me. ",
        "Eve: Can I take a closer look at it? ",
        "Michael: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: What is it? ",
        "Michael: Our family crest. ",
        "Eve: That's beautiful. What does it stand for? ",
        "Michael: Oh, it's a -- it's a long and boring story. ",
        "Eve: Oh, come on, I highly doubt that. ",
        "Michael: Trust me. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? Are you \r\nmarried? Do you have any brothers or sisters? ",
        "Michael: It's getting late. I should be going. ",
        "Eve: It's my hot chocolate, isn't it? ",
        "Michael: Your hot chocolate's great. I just -- I have someplace I should be.\r\n",
        "Eve: What, you got a date? Is that it? You got a hot date? ",
        "Michael: Something like that. ",
        "Eve: Well, then why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Michael: I didn't want to be rude. ",
        "Eve: You're not rude. But I guess you should go. You don't want to keep \r\nwhoever it is waiting. ",
        "Michael: Yeah, I don't want to do that. ",
        "Eve: Thank you for the goody basket, and thanks for staying to share it with \r\nme. ",
        "Michael: Well, thanks for the -- ",
        "Both: Hot chocolate -- ",
        "Michael: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: The horrible hot chocolate. ",
        "Michael: You have a safe trip back, ok, Eve? It was really nice meeting you.\r\n",
        "Eve: Thanks. You, too. And, you know, who knows? Maybe we'll run into each \r\nother again someday. ",
        "Michael: Maybe. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Scott: Rhonda Wexler? Hey, let me get you a napkin there for that fish stick.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Thanks. ",
        "Scott: I know what, you know, everybody else knows -- that she drinks. She \r\ndrinks like a fish. ",
        "Kevin: Well, isn't there anything more you might recall about her? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you know, you've lived in Port Charles a lot longer than either \r\none of us -- you know, maybe just something? ",
        "Scott: Why are you so interested in her all of a sudden? What is this \r\nlife-or-death business? ",
        "Lucy: It's because -- ",
        "Kevin: Since I've seen Rhonda in a professional capacity, I'm really not at \r\nliberty to say. ",
        "Lucy: That's right, so just tell us anything you could think of about Rhonda. \r\nAnything at all. ",
        "Scott: Since when does she consult on your patients? ",
        "Kevin: She doesn't. Lucy's interest is personal. ",
        "Lucy: Right. And the point is, we just need to know anything you can think of \r\nto tell us about Rhonda. ",
        "Scott: Well, I went to high school with her. They used to call her Cookie, \r\nand -- get out of my way. I want to get a fish stick. ",
        "Lucy: They used to call her Cookie, and -- and? ",
        "Scott: And, Lucy -- you know what? We didn't run in the same crowd. ",
        "Kevin: Well, there must be something. A visual, anything else you might \r\nremember? ",
        "Scott: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Scott: Well, on a sadder note, her sister passed away when I was a senior in \r\nhigh school, and it really -- you know, it really sent her over the top there, \r\nand eventually her father had to lock her up in a mental institution. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Listen, pal -- ",
        "Scott: Yeah? ",
        "Lucy: You didn't have, like, you know, a romance with her? ",
        "Scott: What are you talking about? What, are you saying I had sex with her? \r\nWhy would you say something like that? ",
        "Lucy: Because Frank said you had a daughter with Rhonda. ",
        "Scott: What? ",
        "Kevin: So much for calm and gradual. ",
        "",
        "Mary: If you told me how it happened, how you lost her -- ",
        "Frank: Oh, thanks, but it's getting late, and you're probably tired -- I \r\nmean, in your condition. ",
        "Mary: I'm pregnant, not sick. ",
        "Frank: Look, I've already taken too much of your time. Besides, I've got to \r\ngo do what I came here to do before it's too late. ",
        "Frankie: Mommy, I want to take a picture of you. Thanks. ",
        "Mary: Something wrong? ",
        "Frank: No, it's just -- look, thanks again for everything. You have been so \r\nnice. ",
        "Mary: You take care of yourself, ok? And good luck. ",
        "Frank: You, too. ",
        "Mary: Come on, Frankie, it's time for bed. Bedtime. ",
        "Cookie: Frank. ",
        "Frank: Cookie. Well, I was just on my way to find you. ",
        "Cookie: Well, I need to talk to you, too. My daddy brought home this machine, \r\nand it was exactly like the one you described. A computer. ",
        "Frank: The computer. Oh, thank God, Cookie. Cookie, I've got to see it. Come \r\non, let's go. ",
        "Cookie: I'm not going anywhere with you, Frank. And you're not going anywhere \r\nnear my house till you tell me how you knew about that thing. ",

        "Jack: There's nothing like sleeping out under the stars. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I haven't since Girl Scouts. ",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? ",
        "Livvie: Ma and Grandma aren't exactly campers, you know. ",
        "Jack: Well, you are in for a treat because I am the ultimate camper. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I can see that already. ",
        "Jack: Well, I just thought this might help you relax, keep you from obsessing \r\nabout Zach and that tape. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Yeah, I still can't believe I destroyed his confession by \r\nrecording that stupid song right over it. ",
        "Jack: Oh, there you go again. ",
        "Livvie: It was Jamal's only hope out of getting out of that race. ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: And then I get the bright idea of trying to buy his way out of it, \r\nwhich only ticked Zach off even more. ",
        "Jack: Hey, they're called mistakes. It's not your first, and it definitely \r\nwill not be your last. ",
        "Livvie: Is this supposed to make me feel better? ",
        "Jack: No. But this will. No matter how bad you screw up, I'll always love \r\nyou. ",
        "Livvie: I think that may have done the trick. You want to roast some \r\nmarshmallows? ",
        "Jack: No. I want to keep kissing you some more. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, wait, wait -- speaking of s'mores, I got some graham crackers --\r\n",
        "Jack: Oh? ",
        "Livvie: Chocolate bars, marshmallows -- all the -- ",
        "[rustling] ",
        "Jack: Did you just hear that? ",
        "Livvie: Hear what? Oh, you mean like the last time we were up here and you \r\ntried scaring me right into your arms, huh? ",
        "Jack: Well, it worked, didn't it? ",
        "Jack: Hey, what's wrong? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, jeez, I don't know. I just got really cold all of a sudden. ",
        "Jack: Well, hey, I'm going to go get some more wood for the fire. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Hurry back. ",
        "Jack: Before you can get those marshmallows roasted. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, how do you like yours anyway? Light or medium? ",
        "Jack: Black and crunchy. ",
        "Livvie: Ew! Are you serious? ",
        "Jack: Yep, the only way to go. ",
        "",
        "Scott: Lucy, I got two daughters, you know? Serena and Christina. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I -- I do know that, pal -- ",
        "Scott: But, listen, we were married, for crying out loud. Don't you think \r\nthat if I had a kid with Rhonda I might've mentioned that to you? ",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah -- ",
        "Kevin: Scott, if you'll just listen to what we -- ",
        "Scott: There's nothing to listen -- Frank is crazy. If he's running around \r\nsaying this, then, you know, he's got marbles loose. ",
        "Kevin: All he said was that it's a possibility. ",
        "Scott: I'll tell you what's a possibility -- that little green men are going \r\nto show up here in Port Charles, and they're going to come looking for you! ",
        "Lucy: Listen, just listen. Is it possible, just maybe, that you had a tiny \r\nfling that you just put out of your mind? Or maybe a one-night stand you don't \r\nreally remember? ",
        "Scott: It's happened. You have completely lost your mind. ",
        "Kevin: Scott, we know how this can sound, believe me. But the answer to that \r\nquestion, as embarrassing as it could be, could be important to a lot of people.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Pal, he's right. Please sit down. Listen -- ",
        "Scott: Yes, I know. ",
        "Lucy: These questions are ridiculous. It's just that it's very, very \r\nimportant that you tell us. It really is a matter of -- ",
        "Scott: Of life and death, as you keep saying. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it is, yes. ",
        "Scott: However, you have no interest in telling me why. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I can't. It's -- it's just -- please, please give us the benefit \r\nof the doubt. Please try. ",
        "Scott: All right. What can I say, you know? I think that she might've had a \r\ncrush on me, but, then, who didn't back then? ",
        "Lucy: She did, huh? ",
        "Scott: Uh-huh. And she asked me to go to a dance once. ",
        "Kevin: Did you go? ",
        "Scott: Yeah, but I went with a freshman. ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Oh. ",
        "Scott: And, you know, after all this stuff happened to Rhonda and she got \r\nsent away, I felt a little guilty about that. ",
        "Kevin: Is there anything else? ",
        "Scott: Oh, wait. About a week after her sister died, she was saying that she \r\nwas talking to some guy from the future. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Cookie, Cookie, calm down. There's a logical explanation. ",
        "Cookie: No, there's not. My dad told me that Carolyn was the only one that \r\nknew about the machine. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, and she's the one who told me about it. ",
        "Cookie: What, right before she died, she perfectly described some stupid \r\nmachine? ",
        "Frank: It was before she got hit, Cookie. You got to believe me. ",
        "Cookie: I have to go. ",
        "Frank: No, no, no. Please wait. ",
        "Cookie: I'm supposed to be delivering some pictures of Carolyn to the funeral \r\nhome. I shouldn't even be here. ",
        "Frank: But you are because you know how much this means to me. ",
        "Cookie: No. I don't understand who you are or why you're in our lives. I \r\ndon't understand why my dad could hate me so much. And mostly, I don't \r\nunderstand why my sister had to die. ",
        "Frank: I wish to God I had answers, but I don't. All I can tell you is I'm \r\nhere to find Karen, the woman I told you about, the woman I love. ",
        "Cookie: What does some crazy machine have to do with that? ",
        "Frank: I -- I can't explain it. But I swear to you I am not here to hurt you \r\nor your family. You are a good person with a good heart. So please, Cookie, \r\nfollow your heart and help me get to that computer. ",
        "Cookie: No. I can't help you. I can't, Frank. ",

        "Kevin: She actually told you that she talked to someone from the future? ",
        "Lucy: Pal, pal, listen. Did she say who it was? ",
        "Kevin: Or how she contacted this person? ",
        "Scott: Look, maybe I didn't make this clear, but she was nutty. ",
        "Kevin: Over her sister, right. ",
        "Scott: Yeah. You know -- you know, I feel a little bad about it now. I mean, \r\nmaybe if I was nicer to her in high school. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but, like you said, you know, you were just kids back then, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Scott: I know, but I was a bit of a ladies' man back then, and -- you know, I \r\ndon't know, if I'd have taken her to the dance, you know, maybe things would've \r\nworked out different. So then she goes to the -- you know, to the institution. \r\nShe gets out, and then she just starts drinking like crazy. It's, you know. ",

        "Scott: Yeah, that's about it. ",

        "Serena: Oh, ok. ",
        "Lucy: Hey, did you get your homework done? Did it go ok? ",
        "Serena: Yeah. Except dividing fractions is so boring. ",
