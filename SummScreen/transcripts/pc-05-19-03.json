        "Casey puts a stop to the kiss and tries to just be a friend to the grieving Jamal. Joshua warns Jack to be more conscientious about getting to work on time and not disappointing him again. Joshua is intrigued by Frank's news that neither Caleb, Livvie, nor Rafe can be located. Amanda has an unpleasant encounter with a \"brash blonde bimbo\" named Reese. After being put on the spot, Rafe admits to Ian and Lucy that he faked Alison's death. Ian and Lucy are stunned to hear about Rafe and Alison's current living arrangements. After Karen finds Kevin preparing to check himself out of the hospital, she confronts him about the strange drug she found in the syringe in his pocket. Disguised with a scarf and dark glasses, Elizabeth repeatedly walks past Kevin's room until he tells her to come in. Casey forces Jamal to talk to Jack. When Amanda invites Jack and Jamal to the memorial service for Alison that Joshua arranged, the guys take her aside to try to talk her out of this, but she insists that Alison would have wanted it this way. Ian agrees to supply Rafe with blood for Livvie. Rafe gives Ian the antidote for safekeeping. Having decided to hold their own memorial service for Alison, Jack and Jamal approach Rafe about it, unaware that Frank is watching. When Olivia begs Caleb to make love to her right now, Caleb makes the mistake of mentioning the point she's trying to make. Olivia is angry with Caleb for writing a song with Alison, who confronts her about her unfounded jealousy. Unable to stop the imminent cat fight, Caleb leaves in exasperation, and Olivia blames Alison for his departure. She threatens to make the rumors true by killing Alison. Joshua suggests that Ricky sleep with Casey to get her sent back to heaven. Caleb tries to strangle Joshua."

        "Casey: No, we can't do this.",
        "Jamal: Casey --",
        "Casey: No, I know you're hurting, but --",
        "Jamal: I just want to feel like there's some reason to give a damn about anything.",
        "Casey: This is not the thing that you need.",
        "Jamal: Don't tell me what I need, ok?",
        "Casey: No, I will tell you, and you're going to listen. Ok, ever since you found out that Alison died, you've been whacking your head against every single brick wall you could find. you know, turning to me -- I mean, that's just another brick wall.",
        "Jamal: Or maybe it's just nice to feel close to somebody -- that somebody being you.",
        "Casey: No, no. No, I -- this is not about me. Ok, you're just trying to find something to put it all into.",
        "Jamal: You know, you're right.",
        "Casey: I am.",
        "Jamal: I don't give a damn about you.",
        "Casey: Ok -- ok, fine. what are you going to do, huh? You going to kick some more boulders? What? Get drunk? Get into a fight?",
        "Jamal: There's an idea. That's a good one. You're thinking now.",
        "Casey: Or you could just go hang out with some of your friends.",
        "Jamal: I don't know. That list is getting shorter and shorter.",
        "Casey: Not that short. Come on, Jamal, don't make me beg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: How's it coming on your end?",
        "Reese: Well, the lyrics, press kits, everything. We need -- hang on. I'll be right back. Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey. I've missed that.",
        "Reese: I wasn't sure you'd show up. I mean, when you heard about Alison.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I took a long ride on my motorcycle. Almost didn't come back.",
        "Reese: Yeah, well, I'm glad you did.",
        "Joshua: Nice of you to join us, Mr. Ramsey.",
        "Jack: Joshua.",
        "Joshua: Move it, Reese. You and I made a deal. You're supposed to show up on time, not just disappear anytime you feel like it.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, sir.",
        "Joshua: Don't let it happen again. Don't take this warning too lightly. Do you understand?",
        "Frank: Joshua. I've got to talk to you.",
        "Joshua: Only if you have Caleb's head on a skewer.",
        "Frank: We looked everywhere. It's like he disappeared.",
        "Joshua: How can he disappear, Frank? He's mortal. He can't disappear. Did you check Livvie's apartment? Did you check Caleb's loft?",
        "Frank: And everywhere else I could think of.",
        "Joshua: Well, that's very strange. Everybody out there is looking for Caleb and Livvie, and they cannot be found.",
        "Frank: Or Rafe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So you faked Alison's death?",
        "Rafe: To keep Joshua off her track.",
        "Ian: If he thinks Alison's dead, he's not going to want her to be his bride.",
        "Lucy: Oh, please. That is so disgusting.",
        "Rafe: We got to figure out a way to get rid of Joshua cause things are getting way out of hand.",
        "Ian: How?",
        "Rafe: Caleb, Livvie, me, and Alison are all staying together in Caleb's old hideout.",
        "Ian: What?",
        "Lucy: The four of you are staying together? That's got to be a little tense.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it is. Things could fly apart any second.",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait. So you and Caleb are actually working together to keep Alison safe? There's got to be something in it for Caleb.",
        "Rafe: He wants to go back to the way he was. Nobody in Joshua's crew is going to turn him.",
        "Ian: Then why doesn't Livvie bite him?",
        "Rafe: Well, she can't.",
        "Ian: What do you mean, she can't?",
        "Rafe: She can't because Joshua somehow figured out a way to make her fangs poisonous so anybody she bites ends up dead.",
        "Lucy: Too bad Livvie can't just bite her little self, huh? Sorry.",
        "Ian: What is Caleb looking for?",
        "Rafe: Well, a cure for Livvie. It turns out that there's an antidote, so he wants it so she can just bite and turn him.",
        "Lucy: So you found it and gave it to him, and now Livvie's turned him back into a vampire?",
        "Rafe: Not exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Come on, do it, Caleb. Make love to me.",
        "Caleb: Now?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, right now.",
        "Alison: I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm only two feet away. Do you think maybe you could take it outside? You're sort of making me sick.",
        "Livvie: Yeah. But we're not going far.",
        "Caleb: Olivia --",
        "Livvie: Oh, God. I can't get you out of my mind. Come on, Caleb. Do it.",
        "Caleb: You like it even more with Alison around, don't you?",
        "Livvie: Forget about her. just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: What are you doing?",
        "Kevin: What does it look like?",
        "Karen: You've been stabbed, Kevin. You know that you're not ready to be released yet.",
        "Kevin: Well, thank you for your opinion, but I'm checking myself out against medical advice.",
        "Karen: Well, then you're an idiot. You could reopen your wound and start bleeding again.",
        "Kevin: Oh, if that happens, I'll call you, and you'll just come patch me up.",
        "Karen: Oh, really? What makes you think I'll come?",
        "Kevin: You're a doctor. You won't be able to stop yourself.",
        "Karen: I'll help you if you stay here and act like a reasonable adult.",
        "Kevin: Then I'll take my chances.",
        "Karen: Ahem. You didn't think I'd let you leave here with this, did you?",
        "Kevin: I told you that was none of your business.",
        "Karen: Wrong. You're my patient, and you're leaving here to get more of this, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: There's something going on. I don't know what it is, but I can feel it in my bones.",
        "frank: We've got everybody on it, Joshua. If anybody sees the slayer or Caleb or Livvie, we'll hear about it.",
        "Joshua: I want you back out there.",
        "Frank: We've already --",
        "Joshua: Don't argue with me. I want you out there, and I don't want you to come back until you find something. Do you understand?",
        "Amanda: Joshua, I'm feeling a bit lonely.",
        "Joshua: You may go, Franklin. I'm so glad you're here, Amanda. You belong here -- here with your family.",
        "Amanda: But, you know, losing my granddaughter, I just feel a little bit lost. ooh.",
        "Reese: Push off, lady. Watch where you're going, all right?",
        "Joshua: Are you all right, my dear?",
        "Amanda: That girl is so rude.",
        "Joshua: Come. Join me over here.",
        "Casey: Come on. Just come with me. It'll do you both good.",
        "Jamal: Casey, I told you no already.",
        "Casey: Ok, look, Jamal, you're still hurting, so is Jack, all right? You guys both lost someone you really love.",
        "Jamal: Look, Casey, Jack needs a lot more help than I can give him right now. Plus, we already had it out about him working at this place.",
        "Casey: So you guys had a disagreement. Big deal. All right, you guys are way tighter than this.",
        "Jamal: Casey --",
        "Casey: You need to talk to him.",
        "Jamal: Would you stop?",
        "Jack: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Casey: You two, stuff to talk about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: You know exactly how to do it.",
        "Caleb: Like this?",
        "Livvie: Yeah. yes. Please, Caleb, just do it.",
        "Caleb: In front of Alison and the Queen of England if that's what you want.",
        "Livvie: Wait a minute. What did you just say?",
        "Caleb: You want me to prove something to you, to Alison, fine. No problem. I get it.",
        "Livvie: Wait. You don't think I just wanted you and needed you to make love to me?",
        "Caleb: \"Needed\" would be a good word.",
        "Livvie: No, no, please. Just don't do me any favors.",
        "Caleb: Hey. Hey. Relax. I love you. This thing with Alison is ridiculous.",
        "Livvie: So now I'm ridiculous, too?",
        "Caleb: I cannot even believe we're having this argument.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, guess what -- I couldn't believe that the two of you talked about that song you wrote together. and I can't believe the way you looked --",
        "Alison: I've really had about enough of this. I'm kind of sick of it.",
        "Livvie: Well, I think you should stay out of it.",
        "Alison: Hey, don't go blaming me just because he won't sleep with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Look, you can think what you want to think about me, but you know how much I cared about Alison.",
        "Jamal: Right. That's why you're working for the boss vampire, huh? You think Alison would have gone for that?",
        "Jack: I'm not going to apologize for getting a gig in one of the hottest nightclubs this town has ever seen.",
        "Jamal: No, Jack, you might think it's hot, but to me, standing here looking at you -- I am this close to losing it all over again.",
        "Amanda: Exactly who is that brash, blonde bimbo?",
        "Joshua: Oh, that's Reese. She's with the band. I'll speak to her about her attitude. You know musicians. What can I say? Anyway, Amanda, about Alison's memorial service --",
        "Amanda: Oh, yes, yes.",
        "Joshua: Everything has been arranged.",
        "Amanda: I am so grateful for your help.",
        "Joshua: Well, it's helping me also because I really do miss her so much.",
        "Amanda: Oh, I know that you do. Now come with me. I want to inform all the others about the arrangements.",
        "Joshua: Oh, of course.",
        "Amanda: Jamal, everyone --",
        "Jamal: What are you doing in here with this dude, anyway, Mrs. B? Are you ok?",
        "Amanda: I'm doing the best I can under the circumstances, thanks to Mr. Temple.",
        "Casey: Uh-oh.",
        "Amanda: I just want to invite all of you to my granddaughter's memorial service. Thanks to Mr. Temple for arranging things.",
        "Jamal: Wait. Joshua? But Alison would have never wanted him anywhere near her funeral.",
        "Amanda: That's enough, Jamal. I know you have your own ideas, but Mr. Temple has been very kind to me and arranged everything. He's become like family to me.",
        "Jamal: Well, maybe we should discuss what kind of family we're talking about.",
        "Jack: Yeah, maybe we should.",
        "Casey: Not so fast, Joshua.",
        "Joshua: Don't touch me, angel.",
        "Casey: You know what? You make me sick, twisting Alison's grandmother's broken heart like that and turning her into one of you.",
        "Joshua: Well, I'm sorry, but it doesn't happen to be one of your concerns.",
        "Casey: You really think you can get away with this, huh?",
        "Joshua: Oh, what are you going to do? You going to whip up another tornado?",
        "Casey: No, I've got something even better, you know. There's this story, Sodom and Gomorrah. You ever hear of that? A great big pile of salt?",
        "Joshua: You don't have that kind of power, young lady.",
        "Casey: Yeah, neither do you. You've taken over this town, but you seem to forget that I work for a group of people who don't give up that easy. So you better believe, Joshua, that I am going to be on you like --",
        "Joshua: I could crush you.",
        "Casey: I don't think so. You don't scare me. You and I both know that you can't touch me. So you know what? Go ahead, throw your little freak show memorial. I'm going to be sure that nobody goes to that --",
        "Ricky: Hey, hey, hey. That's not a good idea, case.",
        "Casey: Ricky, you know, I can take care of myself.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I know all about your rock 'n' roll angel wings, all right? But that doesn't mean that you should go messing with Mr. Dawn of the dead.",
        "Casey: I didn't know that you still cared what I did.",
        "Ricky: And I didn't know that angels lied. Of course I care. You know I care.",
        "Amanda: I'm lucky to have someone with Joshua's talents looking after me.",
        "Jack: Well, I bet you he's looking after your bank account, Mrs. Barrington, your whole estate.",
        "Amanda: I trust Joshua with everything, including Alison's memorial. and I'm sure if my granddaughter were here, she would say the same thing and feel the same way.",
        "Jack: Alison would never forgive us if it went down like this.",
        "Jamal: No, don't even worry about it. Ok? Alison -- she's going to get the memorial she would have wanted.",
        "Jack: Count me in.",
        "Jamal: What? And get your boss all riled up? You're going to go against Joshua?",
        "Jack: That's what it looks like, doesn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: It's very dangerous what you're doing, keeping this from Caleb.",
        "Lucy: Obviously, you know that if Caleb finds out you have Livvie's antidote -- come on, cousin.",
        "Rafe: Joshua's bad enough, all right. I don't want Caleb to get his fangs back just in time to start an all-out war of vampires.",
        "Ian: Ok, fine, fine. So what do we do now?",
        "Rafe: Let me take care of that. You take this.",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait. No, no, wait a minute. Let's think about this. Why don't you just get rid of the thing?",
        "Rafe: Because if Alison is ever alone with Caleb --",
        "Ian: He can use it as a bargaining chip.",
        "Lucy: Right. Exchange Alison for the antidote.",
        "Ian: So you're fine with this? You're willing to have Caleb be restored?",
        "Caleb: Well, if it's ever a matter of Alison staying alive -- yeah, in a heartbeat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Would you just get out of my face, Alison? What Caleb and I do is none of your business.",
        "Alison: Oh, no, I think you made it my business when you both started moaning and groaning all over each other.",
        "Caleb: Hey, both of you, knock it off, all right?",
        "Alison: Do you really think that I would be that stupid to have an affair with him right under your nose?",
        "Livvie: Oh, I know how you work it with your hair and your smile. You're so sweet on the outside, but always twisting every man around your little finger.",
        "Alison: Oh, so now I'm the one who's manipulative?",
        "Caleb: No, this is --",
        "Livvie: Would you just stay out of this, Caleb?",
        "Caleb: I am out of it! I am out of everything. This is driving me crazy. I'm stuck in this cave with you two. I used to make things happen. I used to be in control. But look at me now. I'm stuck here doing nothing, just waiting for things to happen.",
        "Livvie: No, wait. where are you going?",
        "Caleb: I'm going to go take back a little control.",
        "Livvie: Now look what you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Give me that.",
        "Karen: I tested this concoction. No doctor prescribed it for you.",
        "Kevin: I'm a doctor, Karen, and I can take care of myself.",
        "Karen: Well, you're not doing a very good job. This is a mind-altering drug, Kevin, plus a few other ingredients I can't even identify.",
        "Kevin: Like I said, this is none of your business.",
        "Karen: Where did you get this?",
        "Kevin: Ok, the q and a is over.",
        "Karen: I know the signs of someone with a problem. I can help you.",
        "Kevin: Karen, I know your intentions are good, but it's not what you think. That medication doesn't even make me high.",
        "Karen: Do you hear yourself? You sound like a hardcore addict.",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm not an addict, and I don't need your help. you going to give me that or not?",
        "Karen: No.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Fine. I have more at home. For Pete's sake, why don't you just come inside?",
        "Elizabeth: I was just worried about you after your accident.",
        "Kevin: Really? don't you mean, after you stabbed me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So this is easy, right? All you have to do is stop Joshua, stop Livvie from biting Caleb, and stop Caleb from becoming a vampire again. Cousin, this is great. You can do this.",
        "Rafe: And then there's the two of you. How you feel?",
        "Lucy: I'm good. I mean, I got this doctor person here that keeps telling me what to do. He's bossing and giving me transfusions and stuff, but he's right. I hate that. I feel better. So --",
        "Rafe: What about you?",
        "Ian: Well, you mean other than being a vampire? I don't even like saying the word. Ok, I guess.",
        "Rafe: Hang in there, all right?",
        "Ian: Yeah. Anything I can do to help you?",
        "Rafe: Actually, I need a steady blood supply for Livvie.",
        "Ian: Whatever you need, I'll take care of it. Let me have that.",
        "Rafe: Thanks.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I guess you need that blood supply for Livvie. I'm sure her willpower isn't quite as good as this one here, huh? Would you please, please, please be careful, cousin, ok?",
        "Rafe: All right.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Don't worry.",
        "Lucy: Call me later.",
        "Ian: Come on.",
        "Jack: Rafe, hey. Hold up, man.",
        "Rafe: Hi.",
        "Jack: Dude, we heard about Alison. are you ok?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know, I'm holding up.",
        "Jamal: How could you let this happen? You should have been watching and protecting her.",
        "Rafe: Jamal, I'm already blaming myself, all right?",
        "Jamal: Don't yell at me. Don't yell at me, and I don't care.",
        "Jack: Guys, look, we need to be talking about Joshua right now.",
        "Jamal: What about him?",
        "Jack: He's planning Alison's memorial service.",
        "Rafe: He what? What? Like he's got some kind of claim over her?",
        "Jamal: We want our own service with her friends and family.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Done our way.",
        "Jack: Is that cool with you?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. yeah, that's great. That's exactly what I want, but, you know, right now I really got to get somewhere.",
        "Jamal: You don't get it. We want this service now. As in tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Are you happy now? I'm stuck in here with you while Caleb is out doing God knows what because of you.",
        "Alison: Hey. Look who looks like the jealous girlfriend. I don't even want Caleb.",
        "Livvie: I know what I saw, Alison. That whole thing with the song the two of you wrote together. Are you kidding me?",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Right. This is the part where you think that I'm crazy and manipulative and scheming and everything else, right?",
        "Livvie: You are.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not. This isn't even about me. This is about you and you not being able to give Caleb what he needs.",
        "Livvie: You think you can?",
        "Alison: Don't twist this around. I am not the bad guy here. You are just upset because you can't bite him, and you're taking it out on me, as usual, and you're being completely irrational.",
        "Livvie: You know, I am sick and tired of every time --",
        "Alison: Back off. don't ruin this like you ruin everything else.",
        "Livvie: Would you keep your mouth shut before I shut it for you?",
        "Alison: What are you going to do? You going to bite me?",
        "Livvie: Rafe hasn't made it back with the blood yet, and I am very hungry.",
        "Alison: You just stay away from me, ok?",
        "Livvie: And besides, everyone already thinks you're dead and I killed you, so why don't I just make it true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Yeah, I've got to get going, Ricky. But thanks again for trying to watch my back.",
        "Ricky: You know I'm never going to stop caring about you.",
        "Casey: I know. I --",
        "Ricky: But what? Come on, Casey, say it.",
        "Casey: I just --",
        "Reese: That's it. I'm sick of this dump. Did anyone see where Jack and Jamal went?",
        "Casey: Not a clue, Reese, but you know what? You gave me a great idea. We should go track them down.",
        "Ricky: Come on, Casey --",
        "Reese: Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?",
        "Casey: You want to come with us?",
        "Ricky: No, I -- I got some stuff I need to take care of here.",
        "Casey: Ok.",
        "Ricky: Joshua.",
        "Joshua: Unlucky in love, Ricky? Do you want to talk about it?",
