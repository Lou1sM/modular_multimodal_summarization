        "Karen is appalled by the friendly exchange between Kevin and the woman who stabbed him. Kevin agrees to accompany Elizabeth to Alison's memorial service at the park, but he needs to stop by the lighthouse first. Jamal harasses Rafe for not protecting Alison. When Rafe indicates that he isn't ready for a memorial service, Frank comes out of hiding and accuses him of not acting much like a grieving man. After getting rid of Frank, Rafe agrees that it's time for a memorial service for Alison. Tired of Olivia's threats, Alison takes her life into her hands and slaps the vampire. She's sick of being threatened every time Olivia feels insecure. When Olivia's blood hunger intensifies, she and Alison set out for the blood bank. Caleb tries to wring Joshua's neck. Joshua refuses to hand over the antidote. After provoking Joshua into attack, Caleb throws acid on his enemy's face. Caleb fends off Joshua's goons just as the VH1 crew makes a surprise stop at the Elixir. Hoping to score points with Jack, Reese helps with flowers. Ricky pumps Casey for information about what would get her relieved of her duties. Rafe is surprised to hear that Casey knows the truth about Alison. As Jamal speaks at the service, Alison and Olivia pass by and hear his voice. Elizabeth catches Kevin with his wonder drug, which he claims is a painkiller for his stab wound. After sending her out to the car, Kevin struggles with himself but eventually gives in and gives himself an injection."

        "Elizabeth: It was an accident. I just went crazy for a while. But you're better now. That's good.",
        "Kevin: I'm fine. In fact, I was just about to go home.",
        "Elizabeth: I really was worried about you.",
        "Karen: Ok, are you guys sick? She could've killed you.",
        "Elizabeth: No. I was just very upset about my daughter.",
        "Karen: We're all upset about Alison, but you don't see anybody else stabbing people with a letter-opener.",
        "Kevin: Karen, calm down.",
        "Karen: \"Calm down\"? You're going to let her get away with this?",
        "Kevin: Well, I understand what she's going through. I feel like I've lost my daughter, too.",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you.",
        "Kevin: You know, actually, I'm glad you're here. I was just about to call a cab.",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, I'll take you home. But there is going to be a memorial service in the park for Alison, and I'd really like if you'll come with me.",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm not sure I'd be too welcome.",
        "Elizabeth: No, please, for me. I don't want to go alone.",
        "Kevin: Then let's go.",
        "Karen: Wait a minute here. Do you realize what you're doing?",
        "Kevin: Yes. I'm leaving.",
        "Karen: Yeah, with the woman who stabbed you because your daughter killed her daughter. That is really sick!",
        "Kevin: No, it's like I told you before, it's just Port Charles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ahem. So, you want to have Alison's memorial service tonight?",
        "Jack: Well, we really didn't see any reason to wait.",
        "Rafe: Aren't there a lot of arrangements to make?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, you know, Alison never really cared about all that formal stuff. She really cared about the people in her life.",
        "Jack: Rafe, we thought we'd just have some kind of small gathering here in the park.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we made some calls on the way over here, since you've been missing in action and all, so --",
        "Jack: Nothing's really planned yet. I mean, it's totally up to you.",
        "Jamal: Look, we just want to do it our way, ok? We want to have our own service for family and friends, that's it.",
        "Rafe: I got you.",
        "Jamal: Ok, good. Then we can take care of whatever memorial service Joshua had planned.",
        "Jack: I think I know what's going on here. Hey, man, if you're not ready to do this, that's totally cool with us. We can --",
        "Rafe: Oh. Yeah. I guess I'm not ready, really ready to say goodbye, you know?",
        "Jack: We understand.",
        "Frank: I'm not sure I do. Who puts a funeral service off for someone they love? What am I missing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You need to stay away from me.",
        "Livvie: The problem is if I bit you, I would kill you, wouldn't I?",
        "Alison: Livvie --",
        "Livvie: Oh, wait, that really isn't a problem at all because everyone already thinks I killed you.",
        "Alison: That is the last time you will threaten me with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I thought you'd be choked up to see me, but this is ridiculous. What's the matter? You can't fight your own fights?",
        "Caleb: I figured you'd be looking for me. I just wanted to save you the trouble.",
        "Joshua: That was quite an entrance. Then again, you never had much class.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, what do you say we knock off the pleasantries. You know why I'm here.",
        "Joshua: I'm more curious as to know where you came from. You and I had a deal. Your stupid girlfriend, Livvie, ruined it.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, Alison's death. That was most unfortunate.",
        "Joshua: Unfortunate?",
        "Caleb: Well, Olivia always was an impulsive one.",
        "Joshua: And you'd better watch your neck because your life's getting shorter by the minute.",
        "Caleb: We both know you have an antidote, and you're going to give it to me.",
        "Joshua: Huh, mortality hasn't humbled you one tiny little bit, has it? Maybe dying tonight will.",
        "Caleb: I got a better idea. Why don't I wring your neck until you give me the antidote.",
        "Joshua: You cocky son of a --",
        "[Joshua screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: So, what did Jamal's message say? Did he say why Jack too off on me like that?",
        "Casey: Oh, they wanted to set up a memorial service for Alison, here, tonight.",
        "Reese: Oh, right, so if I want to see Jack, I have to hang around here?",
        "Casey: Girl, you can do whatever you want. But Jamal asked me to stay here and wait for some flowers, so that's what I'm going to do.",
        "Reese: Yeah, all right.",
        "Casey: \"Yeah, all right,\" what?",
        "Reese: I'll help.",
        "Casey: I thought you didn't like Alison.",
        "Reese: Don't start handing me any medals. I'm only trying to score some points with jack, ok?",
        "Casey: Hey. Hi, Ricky.",
        "Ricky: Hey, I got your message. What can I do?",
        "Casey: Nothing. I'm just waiting for some flowers, yeah.",
        "Ricky: All right, well, then I'll wait here with you.",
        "Casey: Thanks. So what did you have to talk to Joshua about?",
        "Ricky: What are you talking about?",
        "Casey: I mean, that's why you stayed over after at the club, right, to talk to Joshua?",
        "Ricky: Yeah, but Joshua and I, we talk all the time.",
        "Casey: Huh. That's cool. You ain't got to tell me.",
        "Reese: Casey, they're here!",
        "Joshua's voice: I really would like to focus on taking this band to the heights where you see it, but I've got this angel that keeps looking over my shoulder.",
        "Ricky: You want me to sleep with Casey -- so that she'll get yanked back upstairs.",
        "Joshua: I have mucho confidence in you, Ricardo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What I do and don't do for Alison is really none of your business.",
        "Frank: Not your typical grieving widower, are you?",
        "Rafe: You want to see me upset? Keep pushing, cause I owe you one, anyway.",
        "Frank: Tough words, but still, not a lot of emotion.",
        "Jamal: Frank, why don't you get the hell out of here. It's because of bloodsuckers like you that Alison's even dead. Now if you say another word about her, I'm going to tear your head off right here, right now. Don't push me.",
        "Frank: Now Jamal is acting like a man who's lost someone he loves. He's intense.",
        "Jamal: You have no idea.",
        "Jack: Come on, Frank, just get out of here, all right?",
        "Frank: And they want to say a proper goodbye. But not you.",
        "Rafe: Why would I share my grief with you, your kind? You feed on people's misery.",
        "Frank: So you're not mourning Alison to spite us?",
        "Rafe: Know what, I don't care what you think of me. Ok? So get out of here! Before I stick a stake right through your heart.",
        "Jack: Look -- hey, look at me. Just let us know when you want to plan something for Alison.",
        "Rafe: Now. You were right. Yeah, let's do it tonight.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you sure?",
        "Rafe: Ahah. Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, it's what everyone needs, right? I know I need it. I definitely need it. I just don't know if I'm ever going to really -- really be able to say goodbye. But you know what, I'm going to have to try, right?",
        "Jack: Ok, then. That's fine. We were thinking maybe by the fountain.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we made a few calls to people, but there's still some more people we can call.",
        "Rafe: The fountain?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Ok, well, I'll -- I'll be right there.",
        "Jamal: Ok, cool.",
        "Rafe: Thanks, guys, for, you know, planning this whole thing. It's nice.",
        "Jamal: No worries.",
        "Jack: Hey --",
        "Jamal: It's what Alison would've wanted, right? Don't you think?",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Jack: We're here, man. Let's go.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Just hang in there, Livvie. Just hang in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I can't believe you just did that.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, you need to get over it, because I'm so sick of you threatening to kill me every single time you get insecure.",
        "Livvie: Well, I can make it more than a threat.",
        "Alison: Oh, no, you wouldn't kill me because you would know that you'd be as good as dead.",
        "Livvie: You think I care about Rafe?",
        "Alison: No, but you do care about what Caleb might think.",
        "Livvie: You think he cares about you?",
        "Alison: Oh, God. You know, you just need to stop. Caleb and I, we have no interest in each other except bringing down Joshua.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, another one of your admirers. You think everyone is after you, right, Alison?",
        "Alison: You think I want any of this? I don't. All I want to be with is Rafe, and all you want to be with is Caleb. You have to forget about how we feel about each other and remember that Joshua is the enemy. And if you and I are going to work together, try and win this war on bringing down Joshua, then we need to find a way to work together and to be able to trust each other.",
        "[Livvie groans]",
        "Alison: You ok?",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Alison: You really need to feed, don't you?",
        "Livvie: What happened to Rafe? I mean, why's -- why's he taking so long? Where's Caleb?",
        "Alison: I don't know, I don't know.",
        "Livvie: You know what, I can't wait any longer. I have to feed.",
        "Alison: No, you'll kill someone if you do.",
        "Livvie: I'm just going to go to the hospital blood bank.",
        "Alison: No, you can't. It's way too far.",
        "Livvie: Alison, I don't care. I -- I can't wait. I have to feed.",
        "Alison: Well, I can't let you go alone. Look, I'm coming with you.",
        "Livvie: So much for trust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Joshua screams]",
        "Caleb: Oh, acid in the face. Ouch, that's -- that's got to hurt.",
        "Joshua: Ah!",
        "Caleb: It's not lethal, but sure feels that way, doesn't it? It's an old slayer trick used to distract vampires so they can drive a stake through your heart.",
        "Joshua: Get me water! Get me anything! Get me something! Ah!",
        "Caleb: You give me the antidote, I'll give you anything you want. Otherwise, I've got some very creative ways to torture you.",
        "Joshua: Get him! Get him!",
        "Caleb: Oh, come on, fellas, you don't want to end up like your boss, do you? Well, just two against one. Ought to be a fun fight.",
        "Joshua: What are you waiting for? Get him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I thought we were going straight to the park.",
        "Kevin: Oh, we are. I just need to get something first.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok.",
        "Kevin: You ok?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. I should be asking you that, under the circumstances.",
        "Kevin: Well, as you can see, I'll live.",
        "Elizabeth: No thanks to me. I'm so sorry.",
        "Kevin: Look, you already apologized. You wanted to hurt someone for hurting Alison. Livvie wasn't here and I was the next best target.",
        "Elizabeth: You make that sound so logical.",
        "Kevin: We all have regrets. Hey, I have a lifetime of them.",
        "Elizabeth: Why did you let her go?",
        "Kevin: Livvie?",
        "[Kevin sighs]",
        "Kevin: I wasn't going to at first. I was going to punish her for what she did to Alison. But when the time came --",
        "Elizabeth: She's your daughter.",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Whatever she's become, she's still my daughter. And I have a screaming headache. There's some aspirin in the bathroom. Would you mind?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, sure. Ok.",
        "Kevin: Shouldn't be too hard to find. It's right you know, there. Yeah, in the front.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, I take that back, I can't find it. Kevin, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Hey.",
        "Casey: Hey. This is nice.",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Casey: No one even noticed or cared when I checked out.",
        "Ricky: If I would've known you back then, I would've cared.",
        "Casey: Oh. I'm not complaining or looking for any sympathy. I'm just saying --",
        "Ricky: No, I know, I know. All I'm saying is that nobody really got a chance to know you back then, not like we have now.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Just kind of bums me out, you know, how I wasted my life. But then I think about now, about being a guardian angel and how -- how I just have this purpose and everything. How it used to feel, at least. Felt good.",
        "Ricky: You ever think about what it'd be like to, you know, not be a guardian angel?",
        "Casey: What, you mean falling from grace, getting sent back up?",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Casey: It would suck. It would mean that I busted big time here and I let everybody down. Yeah, it would suck.",
        "Ricky: So what would it take? I mean, you've already had a few slipups, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah, but I haven't messed up on my assignment.",
        "Ricky: Watching over me.",
        "Casey: Yeah. As long as I do that job, I should be ok. I mean, just can't lose focus, got to think straight. And the moment it seems like I'm doing more screwing-up and harm than I am helping, then they would yank me up so fast, my head will spin.",
        "Ricky: That's why you can't, you know --",
        "Casey: Mess around with you?",
        "Ricky: Mm-hmm.",
        "Casey: Yeah. That would definitely be a one-way ticket back up. And everyone knows I can't think straight if that happens. So even if I were tempted -- which I'm not saying that I am -- you know, it's just not going to happen.",
        "Ricky: Right.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Casey: All this trouble for someone who's not really dead, huh?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I know. Wait a minute. How'd you know that? Oh, yeah. You have higher knowledge. I almost forget what that's like sometimes. Look, I hate this, all right?",
        "Casey: So there's no other way, huh?",
        "Rafe: You know, either they deal with a little pain now or Alison might really end up dead. If there were another way, I'd take it.",
        "Casey: Well, you know what? I hope you got someone good on your corner for this one.",
        "Rafe: You don't want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Take him out of here and kill him painfully.",
        "Caleb: Why don't you do it yourself? What are you afraid of?",
        "Joshua: I have people to do my work.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, because you can't. You'll never beat me, Joshua, never!",
        "Joshua: Take him out.",
        "Woman: It's true! You're back! We knew you were here.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. It's me, in the flesh. Pleasure to meet you.",
        "Woman: Ooh. Were we interrupting something?",
        "Caleb: I don't know. Joshua, you -- you want to tell the young lady what was going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Boy, I'm sorry. You really weren't supposed to see that.",
        "Elizabeth: See what?",
        "Kevin: That's, uh -- that's a pain killer for -- the pain. I didn't want to make you feel any worse than you already did.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, my God, you are so remarkable --",
        "Kevin: Hmm --",
        "Elizabeth: Thinking about me after I did that to you.",
        "Kevin: No, not so remarkable, really. I'm just a survivor.",
        "Elizabeth: Do you want me to help you.",
        "Kevin: No. No, but it'll only take me a minute. Why don't you wait in the car.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok.",
        "Kevin: Ok. I'll be right out.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Kevin: No. No, Kevin, you can do this.",
        "Kevin: Ok, just one more. Just -- just a little.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: You guys, you want to come over here so we can -- there's supposed to be a few more people coming, but I thought it was best if we got started so everyone that wanted to share something about Alison could get a chance to talk. So, um --",
        "Rafe: This is really difficult, for reasons you can't even imagine. Um -- see, Alison -- her friends meant a lot to her. All right, she opened her heart to all of us. And if there's one thing I know about her, she hated more than anything else seeing her friends in pain and -- and seeing them in -- I can't -- I can't do this.",
        "Jamal: I know what Rafe was trying to say. He's trying to say that it's pretty hard, you know, to remember Alison without immediately thinking of how much she cared for other people. So I thought it would be a good idea if we all shared some nice memories about her.",
        "Alison: We're almost to G.H., Ok?",
        "Livvie: What, you still think I'm going to bite someone?",
        "Jamal: So tonight, let's not think about how we lost Alison. We should think about what we gained from her. Because I know personally that Alison, whoever she touched, she made into a better person. She really was the truest friend anyone could have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Go on, Joshua. Why don't you tell the people what's going on?",
        "Woman: Ooh. What happened?",
        "Joshua: I had an acid peel. I'm fine.",
        "Caleb: Joshua's not always prepared to be on camera. Maybe I could help you.",
        "Woman: Great! Ok, for starters, why'd you leave the band?",
        "Caleb: Creative differences. But there's no hard feelings, is there?",
        "Joshua: Of course not.",
        "Woman: So, where have you been all this time? What have you been doing?",
        "Caleb: To be honest with you, I wasn't really prepared to give an interview, and I have someplace I need to be.",
        "Woman: Ok. Well, can we schedule one later?",
        "Caleb: Oh, absolutely. I'll have someone call you.",
        "Woman: Great.",
        "Caleb: You thought you were untouchable, but you're not. Enjoy your time on top. It won't last. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Kevin: Sorry to interrupt your mourning. Could you tell us where the memorial service is?",
        "Alison: I'm so sick of you ordering me around.",
        "Caleb: Get used to it.",
        "Alison: Oh, really? What are you going to do, you going to kiss me like you did last time to shut me up, huh?",
