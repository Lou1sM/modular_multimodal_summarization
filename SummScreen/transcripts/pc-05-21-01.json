        "Alison: Livvie! Livvie! ",
        "Jamal: Hey, hey. It's just us. ",
        "Livvie: God, I am so glad that you guys are here. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my gosh. Are you ok? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but Jack -- ",
        "Jamal: What, he still isn't back yet? ",
        "Livvie: No, and I looked everywhere for him. He was just going out to get \r\nfirewood, and now I can't find him. You guys, you don't think that maybe Zach \r\nhad anything -- ",
        "Jamal: No, no. No, that's not his style. If he was coming after you, it'd be \r\nin the street. Plus, he's got no reason, I mean, now that I'm racing for him.\r\n",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. Livvie, Jamal's right. You know, Jack probably just got \r\nlost or something. ",
        "Livvie: No, he has been gone way too long. ",
        "Jamal: Which way did he head out? ",
        "Livvie: Over there. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Look, you two stay here. I'll be right back, ok? ",
        "Livvie: No, way, Jamal. I am coming with you. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. Me, too. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Stay close. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",

        "Eve: Oh, my God. Oh, I'm sorry. Ooh, I shouldn't say that here. You're a \r\npriest? ",
        "Michael: Last time I checked. ",
        "Eve: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Michael: Because most people act differently when they find out. As you are \r\nnow. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. I don't even know what to tell this -- chief. ",
        "Lucy: Chief. Ok, listen, we'll just -- we'll just tell him exactly what Scott \r\ntold us -- that Rhonda said back in high school, she talked to somebody in the \r\nfuture on her computer and that somebody had to be Frank. ",
        "Kevin: Do you know how bizarre that sounds? ",
        "Lucy: I know, but it won't sound that way to the chief because he is the \r\nforemost authority on time travel. Just ask Ian. ",
        "Kevin: Oh -- if time travel is what we're actually talking here. ",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, it has to be because Frank said he was going to get Karen -- \r\nhis Karen back, right? Well, what else could it be? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know! I don't understand any of this. All I know is Frank is \r\nmissing, and we somehow have to try and find him. ",
        "Lucy: All right. Well, don't worry. The chief will definitely help and know \r\nwhat to do. ",
        "",
        "Ian: How is he? ",
        "Chief: The same. And Arianna? ",
        "Ian: She's slipping away more every day. We need to find a donor soon. And \r\nthis girl, Karen, that he talks about is still Arianna's best hope. Bizarre, \r\nisn't it? Let me see. Heart rate's dropping. ",
        "Chief: Something's going on. ",
        "Ian: What, in 1973? ",
        "Chief: His body is feeling the effects. ",
        "Ian: Effects of what? What's going on back there? ",

        "Frank: Let me go. ",

        "Livvie: Oh, it's nothing, it's nothing. I'm fine. ",
        "Jamal: It's bleeding. ",
        "Alison: Ew. ",
        "Livvie: No, it's nothing. ",
        "Jamal: You need to go back to the camp and get a bandage on this. ",
        "Livvie: No, I need to find Jack! He's got to be around here somewhere. He \r\ncan't just disappear. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie -- no, Livvie. ",
        "Alison: Wait. ",

        "Lucy: Hi. Listen, sorry to stop by. It's so late, but we really need to see \r\nyou. Actually, it's not you we really need to see. ",
        "Kevin: Actually, Lucy seems to think that there's a friend here. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. Ian, it's the chief. I really -- we need to see him. ",
        "Ian: This is not the time. ",
        "Lucy: That means he's here, right? Ok, I need to see him. Chief? It's Lucy. \r\nHello? Chief? ",
        "Ian: Will you keep it down please? Arianna's resting. ",
        "Kevin: Listen, Ian, we don't want to disturb her, really. It's just that \r\nFrank Scanlon is missing. We're trying to find him. ",
        "Lucy: And we believe the chief can help us find him. ",
        "Ian: Well, this -- he can't help you right now. ",

        "Lucy: I can feel it. ",
        "Kevin: Feel what, Lucy? ",
        "Ian: No, nothing. She can't feel a thing. If I see or hear from Frank \r\nScanlon, I'll let you guys know. Good night. ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Well, if you don't know anything, what are these doing \r\nhere? What -- ",
        "Kevin: What are they? ",
        "Lucy: Look. It says \"Mom\" and it says \"Neil.\" It's in the same handwriting. \r\nWhat do you think, Doc? Doesn't that mean that maybe Frank left these and \r\nsomehow maybe Ian knows where Frank is? Is that the case, Ian? Do you know where \r\nFrank is? ",

        "Cookie: I can't believe you broke in here. Do you know how mad my dad is? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, I have an idea. Look, untie me, will you? ",
        "Cookie: I never should have told you about the machine -- the computer. ",

        "Frank: This is -- this is right where it happened. Right -- right here on \r\nthis very spot. This is where I ask you to go steady. 28 years from now. ",

        "Karen's Voice: You're pretty sure of yourself, Scanlon. ",
        "Frank's Voice: But I am not sure about this. If this -- this amazing woman \r\nwho's in my arms, who lights up my life, makes me feel like a prince will agree \r\nto go steady with me. You see, I've wanted to -- to ask you for a while, but the \r\ntime had to be perfect. So what do you say, Wexler? You want to be my girl? ",
        "Karen's Voice: Yes, I -- I do. I -- I am. ",

        "Eve: Thanks. ",
        "Michael: What? Do I have one of those \"got milk\" mustaches? ",
        "Eve: No. You watch TV? ",
        "Michael: And listen to the radio. And on occasion, I've even known to talk on \r\nthe telephone. ",
        "Eve: Ok. All right. I haven't had much contact with priests. ",
        "Michael: No kidding. ",

        "Michael: Like I told you, I'm fixing the place up. ",
        "Eve: Right, but I mean what are you doing here? Why aren't you in a church or \r\n-- or a cathedral or something? ",
        "Michael: I was, but now this monastery's my church. It was -- it was a \r\nbeautiful place once. And I made a promise to myself and God that it would be \r\nthat way again. Now if I answered your question, I have one of my own. ",

        "Michael: Why are you here? ",
        "Eve: I'm looking for you. ",

        "Jamal: Yeah, well, what happened, bro? ",
        "Jack: I was -- I was getting some wood for the fire, and -- and I guess I \r\nmust've tripped over something. Maybe there was this log -- ",

        "Jack: Well, hey, it's not exactly light out here. ",

        "Eve: I came here to get away from everything, to think and to find something \r\nto run to. My path hasn't been as clear as yours. I've run into a few hairpin \r\nturns along the way. ",

        "Michael: All faith, Eve, is based on trust and commitment. Trust in yourself, \r\nin God, and those around you. It's ok, you can yawn. ",
