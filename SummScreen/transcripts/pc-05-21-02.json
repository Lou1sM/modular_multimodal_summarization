        "Ricky: What are you people looking at, huh? I told you this wasn't a good \r\nidea, Karen. You should lay low for a while. ",
        "Karen: Well, I can't stay in my apartment forever, Ricky, ok? And, I mean, \r\nwhat's a little public humiliation? It builds character. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, look, Frank's the one whose character needs major adjustment, ok? \r\nI mean, the guy ripped off your dress and called you a slut on live television.\r\n",
        "Karen: Well, maybe people will think it's some kind of new reality show, ok, \r\nlike \"My Blind Date from Hell.\" ",
        "Ricky: This isn't funny, Karen. ",
        "Karen: I know it isn't. You're right. But I don't have any more tears, Ricky, \r\nand I've got to get back to work and so do you. ",
        "Ricky: No, no, no, look, it's just an interview for a bartending gig. It's no \r\nbig deal. I can hang around here for as long as you need me to. ",
        "Karen: I know you would, and that's why I'm not going to let you. I'm fine.\r\n",
        "Ricky: You sure? ",
        "Karen: Yes. And thanks for everything. I don't know what I would've done -- \r\nanyway, thanks. ",
        "Man: Dr. Karen Wexler? ",
        "Karen: Yes? ",
        "Man: I'm Derek Stewart, managing editor of \"Playful\" magazine. ",
        "Karen: Ok, and? ",
        "Derek: What would you say if I offered you $100,000? ",
        "Karen: I'd say, for what? ",
        "Derek: Well, to pose nude in my magazine, of course. ",

        "Livvie: Go with it. It's been so long. I am just so much -- please, it'll \r\nhelp you remember. ",

        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. It really is you, isn't it? I can feel it. You did it, you \r\nmade contact with me -- ",

        "Lucy: And you're trying to tell me where you are, aren't you? ",
        "Ian: Lucy -- ",

        "Ian: Oh! ",
        "Lucy: Doc? Doc? ",
        "Ian: What just happened here? ",

        "Ian: Who is gone? ",
        "Lucy: Doc! He was talking to me through -- through you. Don't you remember? \r\nDidn't you feel what just happened? Don't you remember? ",
        "Ian: I -- what? What I remember is retracing Kevin's steps. The next thing I \r\nknow I'm out there somewhere, hearing voices, someone else speaking. ",
        "Lucy: It was -- it was Kevin. He was speaking to me through you. He was. ",
        "Ian: Oh, ok. I -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok, listen, did you see anything? Could you sense an image of where he \r\nis? Did you pick up on anything? Any clue at all that would tell us where he is?\r\n",
        "Ian: Slow down, please, Lucy! My head is spinning. I've -- what -- ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. Ok, listen to me. You have to try and focus on what just \r\nhappened. Please try, it's very important. Just try. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Did -- did Kevin -- I -- did I make sense? Kevin make sense? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, completely. Completely. Listen to me. He -- you -- he said that \r\nRebecca came out of the portrait, she lit her magic candle, and then he \r\ndisappeared. ",
        "Ian: The candle -- candle in the woods? ",
        "Lucy: I think it's got to be that same candle, yes. ",
        "Ian: Did Kevin -- did I -- oh, God. Did I say where I was? Kevin's -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no. Something happened. The connection was lost before you \r\ncould -- or he could tell me. ",
        "Ian: I -- I'm sorry -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute! What are you doing? ",
        "Ian: I'm leaving. ",

        "Ian: No, I need some air, I need some booze. Need some whiskey, I can't --\r\n",
        "Lucy: Look, we have to try this again. We have to go over to that portrait \r\nand try it again because Kevin's out there and he needs us to find him. Please, \r\nstay and try again. Please? Please? ",

        "Rafe: Come on, Livvie, what is this? Is this just something else you're \r\nhiding? Who's Jack? Do I know him? ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no. I know him. Jack -- Jack was the guy I was dating before \r\nwe got together. Alison couldn't wait to tell him. ",
        "Rafe: She -- I thought you said he knew about us. ",
        "Livvie: He did. I mean, he does. Jack's the jealous type, Rafe, and whenever \r\nhe sees us together, he just -- he really gets worked up. Listen, I really -- I \r\nreally think that we need to find somewhere else to go. Too many people know \r\nabout this place. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, would you stop it? ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Rafe: Stop worrying about who sees us together and who doesn't. Now, before \r\nwhen we were on the couch kissing, before that guy showed up, it felt -- ",
        "Livvie: It felt -- it was perfect. It was perfect. I have missed you so much, \r\nI've missed this so much, but we have to go, ok? We have to leave here. ",
        "Rafe: Shh. Shh. Look, I -- I can't keep living like this, holed up in hiding, \r\njust sitting around, waiting for my memory to come back. ",
        "Livvie: Honey, I'll help you remember. ",
        "Rafe: I trust you, and if what you're saying is true, then you know what? You \r\nare the woman I love, not my keeper, and I want to remember everything about \r\nyou. I want to remember the first time we met, the first time we kissed. You \r\nknow, our favorite song, all that kind of stuff that I just -- I can't seem to \r\nrecall right now. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, hey. Please, just give it some time, please. ",
        "Rafe: I can't. I need to know what's wrong. Ok? I need to see a doctor. I \r\nneed to remember. That is what you want, too, isn't it? ",
        "",
        "Karen: Are you out of your mind? ",
        "Derek: Just hear me out, Dr. Wexler, please. That clip of you on television \r\n-- well, as awkward as it must've been for you, it's received national \r\nattention. ",
        "Karen: Oh, God, no. ",
        "Derek: So much so that we want to make you the centerpiece of an entire \r\npictorial of professional women like yourself. Obviously, the money's \r\nnegotiable. ",
        "Karen: Do I need to call security? ",
        "Derek: You're beautiful, you're intelligent, you have a terrific body. Why \r\nnot let the world see you're proud of it? ",
        "Karen: Ok, listen, I'm a doctor -- that's what I'm proud of. ",
        "Derek: Look, Dr. Wexler, I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable. In fact, I \r\napplaud you for turning your life around. But this doesn't have to affect your \r\nreputation, just your bank account. ",
        "Karen: Take your money and leave now. ",
        "Derek: Fine, fine, I won't press. But you call my office if you change your \r\nmind. ",
        "Karen: I won't. ",
        "Derek: You know, Dr. Wexler -- you know, there's really no shame in \r\ndisplaying the human body. In fact, you know, we did a little digging. Isn't \r\nthat how you used to make your living? ",
        "Karen: What? ",
        "Derek: Well, as a stripper, which makes your story even more intriguing. Call \r\nmy office. ",

        "Jack: God, I can't believe she'd do this. I mean, come on, move on this fast? \r\nBut I promised Alison I'd get her out of Ian's cabin. That's exactly what \r\nI'm going to do. She's about to be evicted from her little love nest. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Nothing would make me happier than for you to get your memory back, \r\nto see in your eyes that you remember what we meant to each other and the love \r\nwe shared. But visiting a doctor -- that could be dangerous. ",
        "Rafe: That could be dangerous? Why? ",
        "Livvie: Because of the Barringtons. ",
        "Rafe: The what? ",
        "Livvie: The Barringtons, Rafe. They are such a powerful family. They've got \r\nconnections everywhere. I just -- I wouldn't know who to trust. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, ok, you know what? That is a risk I'm going to have to take because \r\nthese questions are driving me up the wall, ok? I mean, there's all these people \r\nout there that aren't supposed to know, but there's this big blank space where \r\nmy memory's supposed to be. ",
        "Livvie: Listen, I will help you remember. Who can do it better than me, huh? \r\nI will take good care of you. Listen, I will give you a bath and a massage and \r\nI'll make you some dinner -- ",
        "Rafe: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? This can't be \r\nfair to you. No, it can't be fun having a boyfriend stuck in neutral. ",
        "Livvie: At least I have you back. And as long as we're together, I am not \r\ncomplaining. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, ok. You've been incredible. Absolutely incredible, and I can see \r\nhow any man would definitely fall in love with you. But I just -- ",
        "Livvie: What? What is it? What? ",
        "Rafe: I got this feeling. ",
        "Livvie: What, is it a memory? ",
        "Rafe: No, it's just a feeling. It's a gut feeling that there's something that \r\nI'm supposed to be doing. Someone I'm supposed to see. It's just -- it's bugging \r\nme. ",
        "Livvie: Rafe, I don't want you to put your life in jeopardy! My father's \r\nalready died. Do I have to worry about you dying, too? ",
        "Rafe: All right, ok, ok. Look, I -- I don't want to upset you, but can't you \r\nsee? I'm not good for anyone this way. All right? Listen, come here. It is going \r\nto be ok. All right? I'm not just doing this for myself. I'm doing it for you. \r\nI'm doing -- I'm doing it for us because I want to. I want to remember us. All \r\nright? ",

        "Lucy: Please, you got to try again. Please, let's just try this again? ",
        "Ian: Try what again? I don't even know what happened here. ",
        "Lucy: You connected with Kevin somehow. You felt his vibration. There's some \r\nsort of psychic force field in this room with that portrait. Please try again, \r\nplease. ",
        "Ian: Well, whatever it was, we'll have to go back to the beginning. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Thank you. ",

        "Lucy: Ok, are you sure -- you're ready? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, let's try it. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. You were standing over here. I didn't see where you had your hands. \r\nWere you touching the portrait? Were you holding the frame? ",
        "Ian: I don't know, I was -- I was touching the canvas, I guess. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Anything at all? Anything? ",

        "Ian: I was afraid of that. ",
        "Lucy: No, listen, I -- I think maybe this time I'll try and initiate the \r\ncontact with Doc. Maybe I can try to bring him out. ",
        "Ian: Bring him out of where? What are you -- ",
        "Lucy: Please, just go with me, ok? Just -- just go with me. Ok? Ok. ",

        "Lucy: Hey, Doc. It's me. You know, you just -- you just talked to me, and I \r\nwant you to try and do that again. I need you to do that. You know, you never \r\nhad a problem talking to me before, so come on. Come on. ",
        "Ian: This isn't working. ",
        "Lucy: Wait -- no, listen -- listen. Doc, it's me, and we're separated now, \r\nbut that doesn't mean anything. We may not be together, but we're never really \r\nseparated. We're always together, heart and soul. You are my heart and my soul. \r\nDoc, come on. You're scaring me here. I'm so scared because I can't find you and \r\nI need to find you. You're everything to me, so please come back to me. Please \r\nfind me. Come back to me. ",

        "Lucy: But, you know, Rebecca does know where Doc is. I can see it in her \r\neyes, I can feel it, and -- and Doc just confirmed it, he did. ",
        "Ian: What are you doing? ",
        "Lucy: I don't want to let this woman or this portrait out of my sight. She \r\ndoes know where Doc is. ",

        "Livvie: Did you run any tests? Did he remember anything? ",
        "Doctor: I found no traces of trauma or injury, nothing to account for his -- \r\nyour friend's memory loss, so I suggest that you make an appointment with a \r\nspecialist. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'll make sure he gets the help he needs. \r\nThank you. ",
        "Doctor: Meanwhile, best thing to do is to surround Rafe with people he knows. \r\nTake him to surroundings that are familiar to him. That's the best way to jog \r\nhis memory. ",

        "Livvie: Well, at least we know your condition is nothing a doctor can treat, \r\nyou know? ",
        "Rafe: I think he just didn't want to upset me. Did he tell you anything when \r\n-- ",
        "Livvie: He just told me that you need lots of rest and time to recuperate, \r\nwhich means lots of tender-loving care from me. I told you. I told you I was \r\nright. You don't need anyone else to help you remember anything, just me. ",
