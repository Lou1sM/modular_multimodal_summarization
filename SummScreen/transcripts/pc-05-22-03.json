        "After climbing out of the body bag and finding himself in the morgue, Jamal is horrified to feel two bite marks on his neck. Although Ricky thinks that Jamal doesn't want to be found, the gang continues to look for their missing friend. Casey finds Jamal wandering through the park with his head covered by the hood of his sweat jacket. Reese and Jack are suspicious of Jamal's strange behavior. Deciding to stay and help Jamal, Casey sends everyone else away. When Jamal reluctantly reveals the marks on his neck, Casey blames herself for being too wrapped up in guarding Ricky to look out for him. At the club, Reese admits that Jamal was acting like a vampire but doesn't think it makes sense for him to have been turned. When the woman from VH1 returns to the club, Jack speaks to her on behalf of the band.",
        "At the catacombs, Rafe and Caleb face off over Alison, whom Olivia blames for everything. Caleb assures Olivia that he and Alison are not lovers. Caleb asks Rafe whether he would prefer that Alison had been killed instead of being on the receiving end of a kiss intended to save her life. Alison takes Rafe outside, where he tries his best to make her see that she's being taken in by Caleb. Alison resents his low opinion of her intelligence. She reminds him that Caleb isn't the real enemy anymore. Rafe worries that if she lets her guard down, it will be the last mistake she ever makes. He is upset about having to speak at Alison's memorial service, which is something he never wants to do for real. He believes that since this all started with Caleb, it will also end with him.",
        "Olivia admits that she doesn't really think that Caleb wants Alison. She's upset about her inability to give him what he needs. Caleb admits to liking Alison as a person but no more. When Olivia's insecurities rise again, Caleb forces her mouth to his neck and orders her to kill him if she doesn't trust in their love. Olivia begs him to stop. She can't kill him, because she loves him. Caleb orders her to show him. He doesn't want her to stop believing in what they have. Despite her fears about unintentionally killing him, they begin to make love."

        "Jack: Jamal?",
        "Reese: Jamal?",
        "Jack: Damn it, where is he? He couldn't have just vanished like that.",
        "Reese: Well, it certainly looks that way, doesn't it?",
        "Casey: Jamal, if you get this message, then you call me, ok? Because if you're at home scarfing down a pizza, I'm going to be real mad. You need to call me.",
        "Ricky: Dude, we tried his cell, we tried his house, and we tried the bike shop.",
        "Casey: Nothing.",
        "Ricky: Which means he doesn't want to talk. Look, you know how he disappears when he wants to blow off steam.",
        "Casey: Yeah, right.",
        "Reese: It's a guy thing. They get all silent and macho when they've got problems or something.",
        "Ricky: Whatever it is, we can't stay out here all night, all right? We got work to do.",
        "Jack: Guys, guys, look, we aren't just leaving him out here all alone.",
        "Casey: Hey, you saw how he was when he took off after Livvie. He blames her for Alison's death.",
        "Jack: Exactly. He barely made it through the service without losing it.",
        "Ricky: Look, I understand, but you can't find a guy that doesn't want to be found.",
        "Jack: Ricky, I'm staying.",
        "Reese: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Casey: Strike three, Ricky.",
        "Ricky: Hmm. Fine, fine. We'll all stay. How's that? Huh? But I bet you anything that Jamal's out there watching us, laughing his ass off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You admit you want to kill me.",
        "Rafe: Damn right. I mean, nothing's really changed, now, has it?",
        "Alison: Ok, stop, both of you, please. Let's try and remember that Joshua is the real enemy here, and we need each other.",
        "Caleb: You know, I like this much better.",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: No more pretending we're on the same side.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. No more trying to save your sorry hide. I should have let you die when I had the chance, huh?",
        "Livvie: That's just great. Now look what you've done. They're at each other's throats once again because of you.",
        "Alison: Shut up. Shut up. You're not happy unless you're stirring things up.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Alison: Rafe, Caleb was just trying to save my life.",
        "Rafe: By kissing you?",
        "Alison: No, it wasn't like that at all.",
        "Rafe: Really? Then exactly what was it like?",
        "Livvie: Hello! Isn't it obvious?",
        "Caleb: Hey. That's enough.",
        "Livvie: Go on, just look at me and Rafe. We started out on opposite sides and ended up in bed together. I think there is a strange, sexy line between love and hate.",
        "Alison: That is very different. You tricked him.",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, I am not stupid! I know something is going on here.",
        "Caleb: Olivia --",
        "Livvie: What? I've been following you around like some lost puppy, while you have been following your instincts -- your human instincts. What, does the whole mortal thing suddenly turn you on, Caleb? So why don't you just tell me the truth. Are you and Alison sleeping together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: No, this is not happening to me. No, this is just some kind of trick somebody's playing on me. Or a bad dream. Yeah, it's a dream and I'll wake up and I won't be a vampire, nothing like that.",
        "Casey: Oh, Jamal? Hey, there -- hey, you guys, he's right over here.",
        "Jack: Hey, we've been going all night looking for you. Where have you been?",
        "Jamal: You don't want to know.",
        "Jack: No, try me.",
        "Ricky: Look, we know you're freaked out about the whole Alison memorial thing, but come on.",
        "Reese: Where'd you go, Jamal?",
        "Jamal: I just went for a stroll -- a little on the wild side.",
        "Jack: All right, well, at least you're ok.",
        "Jamal: What, you care about me now, Jack? Because that doesn't seem like you to care about me. Then again, you have nothing to worry about, do you? Casey you, Joshua, and all your homies have everything taken care of. This is the brave, new Port Charles.",
        "Jack: Look, just chill out, all right?",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. Port Charles, huh? Port Charles -- \"come for a visit and stay for an eternity,\" huh? I like that for the new motto --",
        "Jack: Jamal, chill out.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I'll chill out. Jack, I'll chill out, and I'll kick it right here on the bench and maybe everything will go back to normal, huh? Maybe not.",
        "Reese: He seems --",
        "Jamal: Huh.",
        "[Jamal scoffs]",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know.",
        "Ricky: Whoa, whoa, you know what? What the hell's going on here?",
        "Casey: Hey, man, you lighten up. We were just trying to help you here.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, nobody can help me.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Jamal: Nobody can help me. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: The answer is no. We are not sleeping together.",
        "Alison: Thank you. You don't really think -- right?",
        "Rafe: No, no, of course not. I just wouldn't put it past him to try.",
        "Caleb: Oh, sure. You know what? This is ridiculous.",
        "Livvie: You know, this isn't one-sided here. You don't think Alison is capable of manipulating a man into bed?",
        "Alison: Are you kidding me? You're talking about yourself.",
        "Caleb: Hey, look, believe what you want, but here's what happened -- Alison was upset because she'd heard her grandmother had been turned.",
        "Alison: Yes, and we were sitting in the villa, we were hiding, and I was about to go after Joshua for what had happened.",
        "Caleb: It was totally spur of the moment. I didn't know what else to do, so I -- I wanted to -- I planted one on her. I -- oh!",
        "Rafe: Oh -- right, ok. So instead of putting your hand over her mouth or dragging her out of there or about a dozen other alternatives I can think of, you decide to kiss her?",
        "Livvie: For once, I finally agree with you, Rafe.",
        "Caleb: Hey! Would you rather have her be dead?",
        "Livvie: Yes!",
        "Alison: Oh, get off it.",
        "Caleb: What about you? You feel the same way?",
        "Alison: Look, I need to talk to you, ok? We're getting nowhere. Please? Come on.",
        "Rafe: All right, come on.",
        "Livvie: Well, the two of you got your stories straight. I'll give you credit for that.",
        "Caleb: What is wrong with you? Hmm?",
        "Livvie: You know exactly what's wrong with me.",
        "Caleb: No! I don't. Hey, look at me. I am fighting for us with everything I have, and it doesn't seem to be enough.",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry.",
        "Caleb: Do you really believe that I want Alison? Honestly, do you believe that?",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Caleb: Then what the hell is this about?",
        "Livvie: Just -- it's killing me. It is killing me not being able to give you what you need.",
        "Caleb: You are what I need. You are all I've ever needed.",
        "Livvie: Not the way I am now.",
        "Caleb: Just the way you are, sweetheart. Just the way you are is all I want.",
        "Livvie: But I can't make love to you, not the way you want, not unless -- I could kill you.",
        "Caleb: Don't you give up on me. I will find the antidote.",
        "Livvie: Oh, Caleb, Rafe says there is no antidote!",
        "Caleb: Rafe -- Rafe is a liar. He's a liar, and even if he is telling the truth, if I have to search the world, I will find a cure. Do you understand me?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and what if you can't find it? Then you and I can't be together, but you and Alison -- you're both mortal. You can be together forever --",
        "Caleb: Livvie, don't say that.",
        "Livvie: While I have to sit in the back and watch for all eternity.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey. Hey, please calm down.",
        "Rafe: I just hate the thought of him touching you.",
        "Alison: It wasn't even a real kiss. I swear, it was nothing.",
        "Rafe: Not to Caleb.",
        "Alison: You don't seriously think that he would be, like, coming on to me in the middle of a war?",
        "Rafe: You're just -- no, you're too trusting.",
        "Alison: Hey, I promise you, for the last time, he was not hitting on me.",
        "Rafe: Yes! Yes! Of course he was! That's exactly what he was doing. Come on! Open your eyes, all right? Don't you see he's trying to pull you in? That's the way he operates. And from the way you're defending him, I'd say it's working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Jamal, we're your friends. Let us help you, man.",
        "Jack: Come on, dude. Look, we're your friends, all right?",
        "Jamal: Get the hell off of me, dude.",
        "Jack: What are you doing, man? You want to hit me? Come on, come hit me.",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Jack: If it makes you feel better, then go.",
        "Reese: All right, all right, just relax, both of you. Seriously, this is ridiculous. Just chill.",
        "Casey: Ok, you know what? I'm going to stay here with Jamal. You guys leave. Just go. Go.",
        "Ricky: That's fine with me. This is getting too heavy for me.",
        "Casey: Go. Y'all go.",
        "Jack: Why don't you call us when you come back to earth.",
        "Jamal: You might as well go with them. Get as far away from me as you can.",
        "Casey: Jamal, wait --",
        "Jamal: What, I said to get the hell out of here. What are you waiting for?",
        "Casey: For you to tell me what really happened. They turned you. They got to you, didn't they? You're a vampire now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You know what, Rafe? I really resent this.",
        "Rafe: Fine. But you know what? It's not the first time it happened. Remember when Caleb first came to town pretending to be Stephen Clay? He got to you then, too.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. Did you not hear anything that I said in there? I told you that Caleb saved my life.",
        "Rafe: He is not your friend. He is not your buddy. Are you forgetting who he is?",
        "Alison: No. I know exactly who he is. And I can't believe that you would think that I'm so stupid that I would fall for him like some stupid little groupie.",
        "Rafe: I didn't say that.",
        "Alison: No. Yeah, but you're implying that. And I don't know what it is between the two of you, but this war that you've had going on forever, I think that you've really forgotten who the real enemy is.",
        "Rafe: And you have forgotten who the real Caleb Morley is. I mean, that guy, he might walk like a man and talk like a man, but he's still the same ruthless bloodsucker who stopped our wedding. Remember that? The same person who saddled up your mother and half this town with his evil curse.",
        "Alison: Yeah -- no, I haven't forgotten, thanks.",
        "Rafe: Well, good. Good. Because the second you let your guard down and you let him fool you into believing that he is reformed or harmless or that he's capable of caring about anything else besides himself, it is the last mistake you're ever going to make.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Let's think about this for a minute.",
        "Livvie: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: If I have you, why would I want to be with Alison?",
        "Livvie: You're laughing it up together, telling jokes, kissing each other -- I mean, that's a pretty good start.",
        "Caleb: Ok. What if I told you I liked her?",
        "Livvie: That's just great. She's the slayer's girl. She would make a good trophy for you.",
        "Caleb: No. Not like that. Not -- not in a sexual way. She's got something -- honesty, loyalty. I --",
        "Livvie: That's just great, Caleb. You want me to make you a statue of her? Oh, God. Everything I have never been. So sweet and pure and a nice little slice of heaven.",
        "Caleb: Heaven's never been my thing.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, she's everything I'm not. I never will be, especially now.",
        "Caleb: Look at me. Look at me.",
        "Caleb: What do you see?",
        "Livvie: I don't know anymore.",
        "Caleb: Yes, you do. You see yourself in my eyes. The way I see you -- beautiful and desirable and mine.",
        "Livvie: You still want me the way you always have?",
        "Caleb: Livvie, I was born to love you.",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Livvie: When you look at a woman, something happens. You can't help yourself, can you? But it's as natural to you as breathing.",
        "Caleb: What is?",
        "Livvie: Your need to seduce and capture. It's all about the hunt for you. It's in your blood.",
        "Caleb: You know something? If you don't -- if you don't believe in my love, if you don't trust it, then what's the point?",
        "Livvie: I am just telling you how I feel. Caleb --",
        "Caleb: If that's what you believe, if that's what you really believe, then let's finish this. Let's end this right now.",
        "Livvie: Don't do this.",
        "Caleb: Kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm so sorry, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Give the girl a prize. Now you know my deep, dark secret.",
        "Casey: How -- how did they do it? How --",
        "Jamal: I don't know. Beats me. I mean, one minute I'm walking to the park, the next minute I wake up in the morgue. Not something I'd actually recommend, either, so, don't do it.",
        "Casey: I should have been tailing you. I should have been tailing you this whole time. I should have been by your side. It's just I've been too busy looking after Ricky. I'm sorry.",
        "Jamal: Well, you know what's whacked about this whole situation? Is that I've been telling Ricky this whole time to watch out for these sneaky vampires and everything, and even when Jack, when he was, like, doing his little dance with the dark side --",
        "Casey: You never thought it would happen to you.",
        "Jamal: No, I always thought I'd be cool, you know?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know. I know when I lived here -- when I lived here, I thought I was invincible, too.",
        "Jamal: I guess I thought somebody up there had my back. God. You know, I'm one of the good guys, so, you know, somehow I'm protected. That's pretty freaking funny, huh?",
        "Casey: You know what? Let me take you home.",
        "Jamal: No, you know what? They're going to be laughing their freaking halos off --",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Jamal: And looking at me down here at their number one sucker, saying, \"hey, you thought you were pretty smooth, huh? Well, look here. Why don't you take a little something to the blood bank, huh?\"",
        "Casey: No, no, no.",
        "Jamal: I guess the joke's on me, huh?",
        "Casey: No. No. No.",
        "Jamal: Some joke, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Come on, jack. You tried.",
        "Jack: I know, I know, I know, but didn't he seem weird?",
        "Reese: Jamal? Yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah, like, vampire weird.",
        "Reese: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: Come on, Reese, we both sensed it when we saw him.",
        "Reese: Yeah, but it wouldn't make sense for Joshua to turn someone like Jamal.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Woman: Hey, guys.",
        "Ricky: Hey.",
        "Woman: Is he here?",
        "Ricky: Who?",
        "Woman: I heard Stephen Clay was here.",
        "Ricky: Uh --",
        "jack: Hey. Jack Ramsey. Remember me?",
        "Woman: Yeah.",
        "Jack: It's good to see you again. I'm kind of managing the band right now, and I really don't think you need to talk to Stephen Clay. See, we kind of used him as a publicity act.",
        "Woman: We still want to speak with Stephen.",
        "Jack: Oh, do you?",
        "Woman: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Well, he's not available. He -- you know how shy he is, God bless his heart, but he's kind of a shy guy. Anyway, we kind of moved on without him, and we're going to kind of call the band The Experience. You know, you got to move on with the times. The whole vampire Goth thing is over.",
        "Woman: Actually, that's kind of the reason we're still interested.",
        "Jack: Ok. Well, if anybody's going to find Stephen, it would be me. In the meantime, you can set up and have an interview with these guys. You want vampire stories? We've got them.",
        "Woman: Cool. Then I'll be in touch.",
        "Jack: All right. Thank you. Mm-hmm.",
        "Ricky: If anybody's going to find him, it's going to be you?",
        "Jack: Hey, come on. What'd you want me to do? You guys were sitting there like deer caught in headlights.",
        "Reese: Yeah, well, obviously they still think he's the star.",
        "Jack: Yeah, for right now, until you prove to them otherwise that you guys are the ones spinning the tunes, huh? Ricky, perception is reality. Ok, it's just like Caleb. He got the whole world to buy into this whole Stephen Clay thing. If I'm right, I think I just bought you guys time to get the whole world to forget about Stephen Clay.",
        "Reese: Wow, you really still hate him, don't you?",
        "Jack: No. Not anymore. I'm just kind of following the wind where it blows. And right now, it's about to blow Caleb out of this town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Do it, Olivia! Put me out of my misery.",
        "Livvie: Stop it!",
        "Caleb: If you do not believe that I would go to the ends of the world to be with you, then what is the point of fighting?",
        "Livvie: No!",
        "Caleb: What are you waiting for? Do it.",
        "Livvie: No, I can't! I love you!",
        "Caleb: You love me? You love me? Then show me.",
        "Livvie: No. No, I don't want to hurt you.",
        "Caleb: You can't. We can. We can.",
        "Livvie: God. You taught me how to control myself when we're together. Only when I'm with you, I don't want to control myself!",
        "Caleb: Listen to me. Listen to me. Soon -- soon we'll be back to the way we were. You'll see. Never -- never stop believing in us. Never stop believing in the power of what we have.",

        "Alison: Will you talk to me, please?",
        "Rafe: I don't want to fight.",
        "Alison: Ok, good, because I don't, either.",
        "Rafe: Especially about him. I don't want to fight, all right?",
        "Alison: Ok, agreed.",
        "Rafe: Come here. The thing is, is I was just with your friends, and they were grieving for you, and I had to stand there and pretend like you were dead and that I'd never see you again, ok?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: It's ok. I just -- I never want to be there, you know? I never really want to be standing there -- just up there alone, knowing you're nothing but a memory.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: So I -- I'm not going to apologize for protecting you. I'm not going to apologize for hating Caleb. Ok? Because this whole thing started with him, and I have a feeling it's going to end with him.",
