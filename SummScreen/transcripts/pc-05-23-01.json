        "Chris: When you decided not to come back to Port Charles like you had \r\npromised me, well, I decided to track you down. Surprised? ",
        "Eve: How'd you guess? ",
        "Chris: It's written all over your face, along with -- disappointment? Is that \r\nwhat that is? ",
        "Eve: No. No. Why would I be disappointed? ",
        "Chris: I don't know. Maybe you were expecting somebody else? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Satisfied? ",
        "Ian: His pressure's dropped and his heartbeat's become irregular. ",
        "Kevin: Which means we can't wait until he arrests. Look, we have to bring him \r\nout of this coma now! ",
        "Lucy: Doc, listen, we're all very, very worried about Frank, but what if we \r\nmess things up? I mean, what if we bring him back too soon and we screw up \r\neverything? Everything that he's trying to do, we could ruin everything for him.\r\n",
        "Kevin: By saving his life? ",
        "Lucy: But he knew that risk. Frank knew the risk. He wanted to go find his \r\nKaren. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, we don't know what effects this herb will have on him if we \r\nleave him on it too long. We don't even know for sure if he's actually gone back \r\nin time. All I know for sure is that if we don't do something now, he will die. \r\nAnd I won't let that happen. ",
        "Ian: Kevin's right. Let's bring him back. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Come on, Nellie, speak to me. ",
        "[Computer turns on] ",
        "Frank: She lives, but not for long. Ok, let it start. ",
        "",
        "Chris: So, who were you expecting? ",
        "Eve: Well, I guess I never dreamed it'd be you. ",
        "Chris: Yes, we've already established that. You have any booze, gin, \r\nvermouth, olives? That'd be great. ",
        "Eve: Pregnancy and alcohol don't mix, Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Well, I'm not pregnant. Well, You do have some Irish whiskey, just in case Thornhart shows up, I \r\nsuppose. ",
        "Eve: Can we just change the subject please? ",
        "Chris: Sure, that'd be great. Love to. So where you been all day? Hmm? I had \r\nall these gory images of you, you know, out wrestling grizzly bears or \r\npaddle-less in a canoe heading for the rapids. I was this close to sending out a \r\nsearch party. ",
        "Eve: Really? This close, as in sitting on a couch reading a book? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I didn't want to be an alarmist. ",
        "Eve: Oh, heaven forbid. ",
        "Chris: So seriously, where you been all this time, hmm? Out communing with \r\nnature or something? ",
        "Eve: Actually, I -- I've been hanging out with that guy I told you about. ",
        "Chris: The woodchopper? I thought you were kidding. ",
        "Eve: Nope. He's very real. ",
        "Chris: Well, that's fast work. Not that it surprises me. I mean, you probably \r\nbring your fancy perfume up here, it mixes in with the fresh air, and the \r\nmountain men come a-running. ",
        "Eve: The mountain man that you're referring to happens to be a man of the \r\ncloth. ",
        "Chris: You mean as in a priest? ",
        "Eve: No, dress designer. Yes, a priest. ",
        "Chris: A priest? What have you been doing all morning with a priest, \r\nconfessing your sins? Debating theology? ",
        "Eve: Talking about you. ",
        "Chris: Oh. Speaking of the devil. So was the good padre a fan of mine or --\r\n",
        "Eve: I told him how wonderful you've been to me. ",
        "Chris: Yeah? ",
        "Eve: And how you proposed so that my baby could grow up with two parents. ",
        "Chris: And did the kind father help you decide if that's a good idea or not?\r\n",
        "Eve: As a matter of fact, he did. ",
        "Chris: Ok, well -- I mean, I'm ready, I think. What's it going to be? Will \r\nyou marry me? ",
        "",
        "Ian: This will increase his heart rate and bring his pressure up. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, are you both sure this is what we should be doing? ",
        "Kevin: I am. ",
        "Chief: Ian, Lucy's right. Consider this carefully. ",
        "Lucy: Please. ",
        "Kevin: Look, we have to bring him out of this coma now. ",
        "Chief: That drug you have may reverse the effects of the herb I gave Frank, \r\nbut it won't ensure his return. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Chief: What I gave him merely opened the door. Now, Frank's heart carried him \r\nthrough it. His love and faith are what propelled him forward. ",
        "Kevin: But this coma's induced. We have the know-how to reverse it. ",
        "Chief: Yes, you do. But if you force consciousness upon Frank, he might lose \r\npart of himself in the process. ",
        "Lucy: His heart. He could lose his heart and he could lose his soul. The part \r\nthat's filled with all that love for Karen could be left back in 1973. ",
        "Chief: It is a great gamble. ",
        "Kevin: You knew about this and you let him go through with it anyway? ",
        "Ian: I was trying to help him. ",
        "Kevin: Him? Or you and Arianna? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, please. Fighting's not going to help you right now. ",
        "Kevin: You're right. You're right. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, yeah. ",
        "Kevin: All right, let's just get on with this. ",
        "Ian: I'm ready. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Are you sure you're not making a huge mistake? Did you hear what \r\nthe chief just said? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, loud and clear. The fact is either way there are no guarantees.\r\n",
        "Ian: We'll know soon enough. ",
        "Arianna: Ian? Ian, are you here? ",
        "Ian: Excuse me. ",
        "Ian: Hey. I'm right here. ",
        "Arianna: Ian, I don't feel too good. What's happening? ",
        "Ian: You're fine. You're just fine. Don't worry. I got to take her to the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Lucy: Do you want me to call 911? ",
        "Ian: No. It'll be faster if I take her. Kevin, can you take care of things \r\nhere? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Well, why don't I go with you? ",
        "Ian: No. Take care of Frank. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Ian: I'll be right back. I'll call you from the hospital. ",
        "Lucy: I will. All right. ",

        "Frank: Come on. Come on, what makes you tick? It's got to be today. Today's \r\nthe day Cookie contacts me. I can't let that happen. Ugh! I've got to find your \r\nheart, Nellie, and break it. It's either yours or mine. I got to stop Cookie \r\nfrom contacting me, or Karen is gone forever. And my heart will stop beating.\r\n",

        "Cookie: Dad, wait. Stay here for a minute. ",
        "Harry: What for? I got things to do. ",
        "Cookie: Well, I -- I started a scrapbook. I found some pictures of Carolyn \r\nshe had in a box under the bed. I'll go get them. ",
        "Harry: Leave me alone. I'm going down to the basement to work on my machine, \r\nso don't bother me. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I should have called you, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Uh-oh. That doesn't sound encouraging. ",
        "Eve: Look, I will always care about you. ",
        "Chris: Now it's getting worse. ",
        "Eve: You have been sweet and kind and generous -- ",
        "Chris: Eve, just put me out of my misery, ok? Make it quick. Come on. ",
        "Eve: Chris, what you have done -- I mean, the way you care for me and care \r\nabout my baby, that's -- asking me to marry you, that's incredible. That's \r\nbeyond incredible. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, it wasn't completely altruistic. ",
        "Eve: I know. I'm just not ready for marriage, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Not with me, anyway. ",
        "Eve: Not with anyone. I'm tired of bouncing around from man to man. I need \r\ntime alone. ",
        "Chris: What about what the baby needs, huh? A family, a father. ",
        "Eve: He or she will have that. I mean, maybe not in the traditional sort of \r\nway, but we'll make it work. ",
        "Chris: I just wish you would think about this. ",
        "Eve: I have. ",
        "Chris: I know I've done a lot of rotten things over the years, but I can \r\nchange, and I would change for you. You and the baby. I -- just give me a \r\nchance. I can make you both so happy. ",
        "Eve: You really believe that, don't you? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, I do. I really do, because the truth is part of me has always \r\nloved you. ",
        "Eve: Chris, I love you, too. But the feelings that we have for each other -- \r\nwell, it's not -- ",
        "Chris: It's not the same as what you have for Ian. ",
        "Eve: Or what you had for Julie. We are meant to be friends, Chris. We are \r\nmeant to be the best of friends. ",
        "Chris: If that's true, if we're supposed to be such good friends, how come \r\nyou can't be honest with me? ",
        "Eve: I am. ",
        "Chris: No, you're not. You're clinging to the hope that Arianna will \r\nmagically be cured and you'll end up walking down the aisle to become Mrs. Ian \r\nThornhart. Please don't lie to me. And more importantly, don't lie to yourself.\r\n",

        "Gabriela: You just have to trust that Frank will get in touch when he's \r\nready. ",
        "Joe: That's easy for you to say. Your brother's not obsessing over some \r\nimaginary woman he's in love with. ",
        "Ian: I need a gurney! ",
        "Joe: A gurney, quick! All right, prep two. Two's open. ",

        "Arianna: No, I can't -- ",

        "Eve: I admit it. I've daydreamed about what it'd be like to be married to Ian, \r\nwhat it'd be like to tell him I'm pregnant with his baby. But that's not the \r\nreason I turned you down, Chris. ",
        "Chris: It isn't? ",
        "Eve: No. I mean, none of the prayers in this world can make what I've \r\ndaydreamed about come true. Because Ian is an honorable man, he promised he \r\nwould take care of Arianna, and he is not going to walk away from that. ",
        "Chris: Doesn't sound like much of a happy ending for you and the baby. ",
        "Eve: Well, something or someone always comes between us. ",
        "Chris: So what's plan B? ",
        "Eve: I don't know. I haven't got a clue. I -- I'm going to stay here, I \r\nguess, for a little while and think about clearing my head and think about my \r\noptions. ",
        "Chris: Wait a minute -- options? About the baby? ",
        "Eve: No. No. I am definitely having this baby. ",
        "Chris: Good. He's a lucky kid, you know, getting a great mom like you. ",

        "Chris: You know, I was prepared to go all the way on this one, Lambert. ",
