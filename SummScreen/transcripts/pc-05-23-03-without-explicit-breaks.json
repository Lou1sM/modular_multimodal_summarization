        "Elizabeth is grateful to Ian and Lucy for telling her the truth about Alison. Ian is startled by a flashback of himself preparing to share a mutual feeding with Elizabeth. After hallucinating that white wine has turned red, Ian has a disturbing nightmare in which he is about to sink his fangs into Lucy's neck. Shaken, he sends Lucy to bed and then prepares to feed from a bag of blood. After Elizabeth apologizes to Kevin for her behavior at the memorial service, the two end up in each other's arms. When Ricky refuses to cause Casey to fall from grace, Joshua threatens to replace him with a more ambitious musician. Ricky reluctantly agrees to honor the request, but he warns that it won't be easy. Casey tries to persuade Jamal to use his new powers for the good side, but Jamal is very discouraged about his situation. Casey decides to stop playing by the rules and start doing things her way. Olivia dreams that Caleb no longer wants to become a vampire. She's also convinced that she will eventually kill him in her passion, but Caleb assures her that everything will be all right. Jamal ends up outside the Elixir but walks away instead of going inside."
