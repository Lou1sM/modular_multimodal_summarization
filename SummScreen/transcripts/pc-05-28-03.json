        "Lucy's attempt to seduce a reluctant Ian is interrupted by the arrival of her cousin. Asking for the antidote back, Rafe stuns Ian and Lucy by announcing his intention to allow Caleb to become a vampire if it will mean vanquishing Joshua. Maintaining that no vampire can be trusted, Ian refuses to cooperate until Lucy steps in and voices her own opinion. After Rafe leaves, Lucy again tries to seduce the man she loves, unaware that his vampire nature is rising to the surface. Caleb takes care of Alison, who is grateful to him for saving her life. Realizing that Olivia must have been her attacker, she confronts Caleb with her suspicion. He persuades her not to tell Rafe despite their pact not to have any secrets. In an attempt to ward off yet another unwarranted attack by her former best friend, Alison tries to leave, but Caleb persuades her to stay. Olivia offers to lead Joshua to Alison--who is very much alive-- in return for the antidote. Joshua learns that it's missing and accuses her of playing games. Olivia informs him that Rafe must have stolen it. Joshua goes after her with a stake until she begs for mercy. He lets her go, because he can find Alison without her help. Fleeing the villa, Olivia worries about how to tell Caleb what she's done. Joshua arranges for Alison to be delivered to him. Caleb blames himself for Olivia's behavior, since he shouldn't have admitted to liking Alison as a person. When he returns from investigating a noise, Alison is gone. Rafe returns to the catacombs and admits to having the antidote. Learning that Alison is gone, he looks at Olivia accusingly. Frank delivers Alison to Joshua, who presents her with a pre-wedding gift in the form of Jamal."

        "Ian: I have to fight this. I have to keep fighting it.",
        "Ian's voice: It's time, Lucy. it's time.",
        "[Ian snarls]",
        "Ian: I can't let this happen.",
        "Lucy: Hey.",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Lucy: I -- I can't stop thinking about something.",
        "Ian: About what?",
        "Lucy: You and me. Guess who is feeling so much better.",
        "Ian: Well, that's the transfusions, you know.",
        "Lucy: Yeah -- oh, yeah, that's part of it. But making love with you makes all the difference. And maybe, just maybe it can make a big difference for you, too.",
        "Ian: What difference is that?",
        "Lucy: Well, I -- I haven't felt like this in a long time, maybe in forever, and I feel like I'm maybe getting my slayer powers back, which means maybe that means you won't have to drink blood anymore.",
        "Ian: That's a lot of maybes.",
        "Lucy: Could you stop, just be positive for a little while, and kiss me? Hmm? Hmm?",
        "Ian: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Uh-uh. Shh. Shush. I'm very busy here.",
        "Lucy: What? what is it?",
        "Ian: We have company.",
        "Lucy: What? how do you know that?",
        "Ian: Rafe.",
        "Lucy: Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Sorry. I know it's late.",
        "Lucy: Uh -- what -- what's going on? What's wrong?",
        "Rafe: Nothing, I just -- I need the antidote back that I gave you to hold.",
        "Ian: But then Livvie can bite whoever she pleases.",
        "Lucy: You mean, Caleb?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that's the point.",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, \"that's the point\"?",
        "Rafe: I need Livvie to turn Caleb back into a vampire. The sooner the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Alison?",
        "Alison: Hmm?",
        "Caleb: Broth. It'll keep you warm.",
        "Alison: Thank you. I didn't know that you were such a cook.",
        "Caleb: There's probably a lot you don't know about me. Yeah, I can open a packet, add boiling water.",
        "Alison: I'm very impressed.",
        "Caleb: Hmm.",
        "Alison: Thank you. it's making me feel a little bit better. I appreciate it.",
        "Caleb: Just a little?",
        "Alison: Well, I mean, what did you expect? I mean, after the ordeal we just went through, I would think a little bit better is all we can hope for right now.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Thanks for saving me from whatever that was.",
        "Caleb: You already said thanks.",
        "Alison: I know. Well, thanks, again.",
        "[Caleb chuckles]",
        "Alison: What? What's so funny?",
        "Caleb: I still -- I just -- I can't believe Rafe left you alone here with me.",
        "Alison: Well, I think that you made a real impression on him tonight.",
        "Caleb: I usually do.",
        "Alison: No, I mean it. I feel like it was different than when you usually talk to him. You really meant it when you said that we were all going to work together, didn't you? I wish that Livvie felt the same way.",
        "Caleb: You got to give her time, Alison.",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. Where is she, anyway? I haven't seen her in a while. Have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Joshua?",
        "Joshua: Ah. Find your way in all right? I left the gates open for you. You didn't kill any more of my guards, I hope?",
        "Livvie: We have to talk.",
        "Joshua: So you said. Well, you called this meeting. What do you want?",
        "Livvie: She's alive.",
        "Joshua: I beg your pardon?",
        "Livvie: Alison Barrington -- she's still alive, and if you still want her, I know where she's hiding.",
        "Joshua: I'd like a few more picturesque details, if you please.",
        "Livvie: Everything you need to know.",
        "Joshua: In exchange for something that you want very badly.",
        "Livvie: I'll give you Alison if you agree to give that antidote to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: No, really, I haven't seen her in quite a while. Have you?",
        "Caleb: When she left, she said something about wanting to be alone. Maybe she -- maybe she took a walk. I'm sure she's fine, Alison.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm not really worried about her, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: You're not worried? Then why are you asking?",
        "Alison: It was her, wasn't it?",
        "Caleb: What? I --",
        "Alison: That thing that attacked me -- it wasn't one of Joshua's little surprises that was Livvie.",
        "Caleb: Alison, you should sit down. I think you're still in shock.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm sure I am in shock. Because if I wasn't, I would've figured that out a long time ago. It makes perfect sense. She thinks that you and I have some sort of connection going on, so she wants to try and kill me again.",
        "Caleb: Again? What does that mean?",
        "Alison: Well, every couple of months, Livvie decides that I am the cause of all of her problems. she always tries to kill me. I'm getting -- I'm getting out of here.",
        "Caleb: Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going?",
        "Alison: I'm leaving. You think I'm going to let her take another shot at me?",
        "Caleb: No, she won't hurt you. It won't happen again, all right?",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Caleb: No.",
        "Alison: You're going to protect me?",
        "Caleb: I will.",
        "Alison: You knew it was her, didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "Caleb: I promise you, I promise you -- listen to me, Alison, it will not happen again.",
        "Alison: Caleb --",
        "Caleb: Listen, you do not have to worry about Olivia or anything else. As long as I'm here, I have your back. But you have to stay, all right? Please, stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You're just going to have to trust me, ok?",
        "Lucy: But -- just slow down. Slow down.",
        "Rafe: I can't!",
        "Ian: Well, you're going to have to because I'm not giving you the antidote until you tell me why you changed your mind.",
        "Rafe: There's a lot of things. There's a lot of reasons, ok?",
        "Ian: Like what?",
        "Rafe: Alison, ok? She called me on something and she's right.",
        "Ian: She called you on what?",
        "Rafe: It's just Caleb and me. I mean, we've been spending so much time trying to one-up each other, just fighting each other, that we're forgetting what we're all really fighting for.",
        "Ian: To beat Joshua.",
        "Lucy: Right, and to keep Alison from completing his wedding plans.",
        "Rafe: Right. See, and Caleb knows Joshua better than anybody, and he can use what he knows if he gets his powers back.",
        "Ian: And what makes you think that Caleb will still work with us after he gets what he wants?",
        "Rafe: He saved Alison's life.",
        "Ian: What?",
        "Lucy: What, he saved -- how?",
        "Rafe: There was this thing, this animal or something, came out of the blue, tried to attack Alison, and he -- he fought it off.",
        "Ian: Wait, what animal? What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Caleb doesn't have his powers. So how could he fight off this animal thingy, whatever it was, if he doesn't? So why do we need to give him any more power? I mean, he doesn't need the antidote!",
        "Rafe: He got lucky! He just got lucky, ok? That kind of luck is not going to hold out forever, and I can't fight Joshua alone!",
        "Ian: No one's asking you to fight him alone.",
        "Lucy: I know that. We are going to help you, of course.",
        "Rafe: You are. You already are. You're helping by staying in town, keeping an eye on what's going on here. Look, no. I know why you're worried. I'm worried, too. but, really, Caleb is the best person to help me beat Joshua. I mean, you know, he was a vampire, he can be again. He knows how a vampire thinks.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok. I think what you're trying to say is that Caleb is just basically the lesser of two evils, right?",
        "Rafe: Yes. And he's promised me. Caleb has absolutely promised me that he will work with me until Joshua is obliterated.",
        "Ian: He's promised you? A vampire promised you? You know you can't trust a vampire -- not Joshua, not Livvie, not Caleb --",
        "Lucy: Ian, stop.",
        "Ian: Not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: So it was all just a pack of lies? The tears? The memorial service? You never killed Alison.",
        "Livvie: Give me the antidote and I will give you all the answers you're looking for.",
        "Joshua: I'm sorry, Livvie. No deal.",
        "Livvie: Fine, but without me, you'll never find her. No antidote, no bride.",
        "Joshua: All right, don't move! I'll give you what you want. You give me what I want.",
        "Livvie: Is that it?",
        "Joshua: I said don't move.",
        "Joshua: You tell me exactly where Alison is, or I'll pour out every last drop. What the --",
        "Livvie: What? What's wrong?",
        "Joshua: What kind of game are you playing with me? This is empty!",
        "Livvie: Nothing. I'm not playing any games. How would I know the antidote is gone?",
        "Joshua: You're a liar.",
        "Livvie: I swear to you! Rafe. Oh, my God. It's Rafe. He snuck in and he took it.",
        "Joshua: He what?",
        "Livvie: He lied to me. He said that he came into the villa and he searched the whole, entire place for the antidote, and there was no trace of it at all. Oh, my -- he's been holding out on me, that little snake. After all the \"Livvie, we got to work as a team, we got to be together,\" he's had it all along.",
        "Joshua: Shocking.",
        "Livvie: Oh, my God. Wait till I tell Caleb. We'll see how much he trusts his precious Alison and Rafe then.",
        "Joshua: Oh, so you're jealous of Alison. That's why you came here to turn her in. You just swim in bile and venom. You're like a swamp creature. How heinous it must to be to live inside your skin.",
        "Livvie: There's more, isn't there? I mean, if there isn't, you can make more. I know you can, please. Please, just give me -- give me the antidote and I will happily lead you to Alison and Rafe.",
        "Joshua: I have a better idea. Why don't you tell me exactly where Alison is, or I'll take a stake and I'll drive it through your miserable little heart --",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Joshua: And I won't even blink.",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Joshua: And your poisoned fangs --",
        "Livvie: No --",
        "Joshua: Can't do anything to me --",
        "Livvie: No, please --",
        "Joshua: Not with the ring. No vampire can harm me.",
        "Livvie: Please don't do this.",
        "Joshua: Say \"mercy.\"",
        "Livvie: No! Please --",
        "Joshua: Say \"mercy.\"",
        "Livvie: Mercy, please. Please.",
        "Joshua: Mercy? Ok. If you can't pull the wings off the fly and watch her struggle, what's the point? You can .. go on. Run away. You've given me what I wanted. Alison's alive. You can leave the rest up to me. I will find her. You can leave with nothing. Oh -- give you consolation prize -- front-row seats at the wedding ceremony. Right down front. You'll get a perfect view. bye-bye.",
        "[Joshua laughs]",
        "Livvie: No. no.",

        "Lucy: You don't know what you're saying. Rafe, don't pay any attention.",
        "Ian: He knows I'm right.",
        "Rafe: No. No, I don't.",
        "Ian: How can you trust me if I can't trust myself?",
        "Lucy: I trust you.",
        "Ian: Yeah. You don't know what it's like. You don't know what it's like to have this run through your veins day and night.",
        "Lucy: I know that you fight it. I watch you fight it, and you're going to keep on fighting it.",
        "Ian: Until I can't fight it anymore, and now this vampire slayer has to create more of them, more of us!",
        "Rafe: I will deal with the consequences, all right, once Joshua's out of the way. Now, please, give me the antidote. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "Ian: No!",
        "Lucy: Give it to him, please! Give it to him. Please. I believe him. I think he's right. Because if we don't, Joshua's going to turn our whole town into some version of his own Transylvania. everybody he comes in contact with, he bites. So if Caleb is our only chance, I think that's a chance we have to take.",
        "Ian: I hope you know what you're doing.",
        "Rafe: I've been at this a long time.",
        "Lucy: A lot longer than we have.",
        "Rafe: Thanks. both of you.",
        "Ian: Just get it done, would you?",
        "Rafe: Well, that's the plan and, you guys -- heads up, because I have a feeling things are going to start happening fast.",
        "Lucy: I hope so, cousin. I know that was very hard for you. Are you ok?",
        "Ian: I just haven't been able to trust in anything for a while now.",
        "Lucy: But you -- you can trust me.",
        "Ian: Lucy, no.",
        "Lucy: Listen to me, look at me. Please don't be afraid. You know when you look in my eyes that you can trust me. You can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Stop! Leave me alone. Ok. Oh, God. How am I going to tell Caleb what I've done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Come straight here when you're done. I'll be waiting.",

        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no, no. We said no more lies, remember?",
        "Caleb: What good is it going to do? Think about it. It's just going to stir all that stuff up.",
        "Alison: Fine, fine, fine. I just wish that Livvie --",
        "Caleb: That, what, she'd be more like you? Believe what you believe? You know, she's been abandoned by everyone that ever meant anything to her and when she gets threatened, when she feels insecure, she strikes out.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, she usually strikes out on me.",
        "Caleb: This one might be my fault. I made the mistake of telling her I liked you.",
        "Alison: What? Why? You do?",
        "Caleb: You're a pain, you're stubborn, sorely lacking in common sense, but -- yeah, I do.",
        "[Noise]",
        "Alison: Um -- what is that?",
        "Caleb: Shh -- stay.",

        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: Why you coming clean now?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I guess I finally started listening to Alison. Where is she?",
        "Caleb: Gone.",
        "Rafe: Gone?",
        "Caleb: Look, I don't know what happened. We were just sitting right here. We were talking. I heard something outside, and when I came in, she'd disappeared.",
        "Rafe: Oh, that's great. She can't just disappear! Vampires -- vampires disappear.",
        "Livvie: Vampires?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You know, like you.",
        "Caleb: You know anything about this?",

        "Alison: Stop it.",
        "Joshua: Would you -- please, please, please, don't bruise that pale bridal flesh. It tears me up to see you so agitated when all I want to do is make you happy.",
