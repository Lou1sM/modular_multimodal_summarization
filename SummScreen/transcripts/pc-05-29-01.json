        "Gabriela: They're calling you the miracle patient. You know that? There isn't \r\na doctor on staff who's ever seen a transplant go so well. Your numbers are \r\namazing. ",
        "Arianna: Well, I know something that can make me feel even better. ",
        "Gabriela: Whatever it is, name it. ",
        "Arianna: A comfortable pair of pajamas. ",
        "Gabriela: What's the matter? You don't love our hospital gowns? ",
        "Arianna: To be honest, if I have to spend one more night in this horrible \r\nthing, I think I might scream. ",
        "Gabriela: Spoken like a free and independent American woman. ",
        "Karen: Knock, knock. ",
        "Gabriela: Karen. What are you doing out of bed? ",
        "Karen: I came to see how our wonder patient is doing. Up for another visitor?\r\n",
        "Arianna: You're not just another visitor. You're a part of me. You're the \r\nreason I'm still here. ",
        "Gabriela: Come. Sit. I got some pajama shopping to do before my lunch break's \r\nover anyway. And since the two of you are sharing something pretty special, my \r\nbet is you have a lot to talk about. ",
        "Arianna: Thank you. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, you just stick to your reputation. That's all the thanks any \r\nof us need. I'll see you guys later. ",
        "Karen: Ok, goodbye. ",
        "Gabriela: Goodbye. ",
        "Karen: You look great. How are you feeling? ",
        "Arianna: Karen, if you hadn't volunteered to be my donor, I would have died. \r\nI owe you everything. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for saving my life.\r\n",
        "",
        "Victor: We're back! We're back. Mission accomplished. ",
        "Lucy: Mission accomplished? Wait a minute. How did the two of you pack the \r\nperfect picnic lunch so quickly? ",
        "Serena: Victor did all the choosing. ",
        "Victor: Well, you kept asking me to choose. ",
        "Serena: Whatever. ",
        "Victor: We have all your favorites. We have bologna on fresh-baked cranberry \r\nbread. We have PB&J on crispy cracker hors d'oeuvres, salad nicoise for madame, \r\nand for dessert, some of my deservedly world-famous pineapple upside-down cake.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yum, yum, yum, yum. ",
        "Serena: Mom, can't we just go to the mall and shop instead? ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. We're not going to the mall. You can't earn your last \r\nLadybug Troop badge at the mall. We need to go venture into the great outdoors \r\n-- the woods. ",
        "Serena: Ladybug Troop is for babies. ",
        "Victor: It is? When did that happen? ",
        "Lucy: Listen, you love the Ladybug Troop. You always love it. ",
        "Victor: Learning how to survive out in those woods is definitely not kids' \r\nstuff, you know? ",
        "Serena: Whatever you guys say. ",
        "Victor: I've heard some very weird stories about -- well, never mind. ",
        "Serena: Never mind what? What kind of stories? ",
        "Victor: Well, I heard that some very mysterious, very strange things have \r\nhappened out in those woods. Very, very strange. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Come on, Eve. You got to be here. It's our special place. ",
        "Ian: Hello? Hello. Eve? Lambert, are you here? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Michael? Hey, it's me. I wanted to talk to you about this list of places \r\nthat you gave me. Michael? Hello? Ooh. Little heat would be good. And some \r\nlights. Yeah, electricity -- what a concept. Michael? Hello? Are you here? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Mmm, mmm, mmm. Everything -- oh, it smells so incredible. ",
        "Victor: Uh-uh -- no, no, no, no. No eating till you get to the woods. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, pooh. ",
        "Victor: And when you get out there, be very careful to keep this top on very \r\ntightly. Old Sasquatch has got a nose like ten bloodhounds. ",
        "Serena: Sasq who? ",
        "Victor: Sasquatch. You know, Bigfoot. ",
        "Serena: There's no such thing as Bigfoot. ",
        "Victor: Oh, no? Are you going to be the one to tell him when he comes \r\ncrashing through the bushes after my chicken? ",
        "Serena: Nice try, Victor, but Bigfoot's just a legend. ",
        "Victor: Are you sure? ",
        "Lucy: You know, we better go. You know, we want to be there for the good \r\nlight and stuff, so here we go. You ready? Yeah? ",
        "Serena: Mm-hmm. Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, good. ",
        "Victor: Ok, I'll take it out to the car. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, thanks. ",
        "Victor: And stay very close together because I want both of you to come back.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Right. You ready? ",
        "Serena: Yep. ",
        "Lucy: We will come back. This is going to be so much fun, I promise. You'll \r\nlike it better than you think you will. ",
        "Gabriela: Hello, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Hello, there. How are you? ",
        "Gabriela: Good. How are you? Serena, where are you guys off to? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, we have the best day planned. We're going to the woods, you know, \r\nnorth of town. We're going to have a mother-daughter picnic because she's going \r\nto earn her Ladybug Troop badge -- the last one -- and she becomes a Royal \r\nButterfly. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, congratulations on your last badge. That's really awesome.\r\n",
        "Serena: You think? ",
        "Gabriela: Yes. ",
        "Serena: I guess kind of. ",
        "Lucy: It is. It is. Thank you. ",
        "Gabriela: You're welcome. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, see you later. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, so when you guys get out to the woods, just keep your eyes \r\nopen. Be careful. ",
        "Lucy: What does that mean? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, nothing, nothing. I just -- There's something about that whole area \r\nthat's always just made me a little nervous, that's all. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Ok, well, we will. Thanks for the warning. ",
        "Gabriela: You know, I'm probably being silly, so just have fun. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: We'll try. ",
        "Gabriela: Bye. ",
        "Lucy: All right. Ok. ",
        "Serena: Mom? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah? ",
        "Serena: Ready when you are. ",
        "Lucy: I'm ready, but do -- it's kind of a drive. Do you want to maybe just \r\nstay in the park instead of going all that way out to the woods? ",
        "Serena: Everyone's scared you about the woods. ",
        "Lucy: No! Heck, no. You know me. I'm not scared of anything. I just thought \r\n-- no, we'll go. You ready? ",
        "Serena: Are you sure? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go. We're going to have this adventure. We're off \r\nto see the woods. Come on, it's going to be fun. I swear. ",
        "",
        "Arianna: I wish I knew how to say thank you. ",
        "Karen: You just did. ",
        "Arianna: The right way, the right words to let you know how grateful I am.\r\n",
        "Karen: Arianna, please stop. I'm just sorry it took me so long to volunteer.\r\n",
        "Arianna: You needed time to think and talk to friends. I understand. ",
        "Karen: You know, there was one friend in particular that helped make up my \r\nmind. I might not have made the right choice if it wasn't for Eve. ",
        "Arianna: Eve? ",
        "Karen: Helped me get past all my fears about everything. You know, I wish she \r\nwas around right now so I could thank her. ",
        "Arianna: Well, soon, you'll have your wish, then. Eve will know. ",
        "Karen: She will? ",
        "Arianna: Ian will tell her. He's on his way right now to find her and be with \r\nher. ",
        "Karen: \"Be with her?\" ",

        "Ian: Come on, Lambert. I know you were here. I can feel it. Now, where'd you \r\ngo? Hmm? Where'd you go? I know you're close. All right.",
        "Ian: You got to be ok. Please, you got to be. ",

        "Eve: Hello, Michael. Ok, it's not funny anymore. Where are you? ",
        "Eve: Oh, I didn't see this door before. Maybe -- ",
        "Eve: Hello? ",
        "",
        "Karen: So Ian's gone to find Eve. Sounds like I'm not the only one who made a \r\nsacrifice. ",
        "Arianna: Is doing the right thing ever really a sacrifice? ",
        "Karen: I know you were hoping for things to work out with you and Ian. ",
        "Arianna: Ian is a beautiful man. And that dream was a beautiful dream. But a \r\nperson has to be blind or asleep or a fool to not see that Ian and Eve are meant \r\nfor each other. ",
        "Karen: You'll find a love like that one day. I'm sure of it. ",
        "Arianna: Well, if I do, it's all thanks -- ",
        "Karen: Arianna, please, you're making me sound like some sort of saint. ",
        "Arianna: You are to me, and always will be. Millions refuse to even think \r\nabout being tested. Why help a stranger in need? ",
        "Karen: Well, if they knew how they'd feel right now, I think millions would \r\nbe lining up to be a donor. ",
        "Arianna: I will never forget what you've done for me. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Karen: Well, I better get back to my room. There's nothing worse for a doctor \r\nthan being scolded by a nurse. ",
        "Arianna: Goodbye. ",
        "Karen: I'll see you soon. ",
        "Arianna: Yeah. Soon. ",

        "Gabriela: I made that call for you to Victor Collins. ",
        "Arianna: And? ",
        "Gabriela: Everything's ready. Just give the word and he'll get the ball \r\nrolling. Hey, are you sure this is what you want? ",
        "Arianna: This is exactly what I want. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ok. There is nothing to be afraid of. It's just a big old drafty church. \r\nAnd one thing's for sure -- nothing bad ever happens in church. You just forget \r\nabout all those spooky movies I've seen. There, that's better. They're almost \r\nall lit. Ouch. Ok, that's good. What do you say we have a seat and wait for \r\nMichael? Oh. We can look at all these places on this list and figure out where \r\nwe're going to start our new life. Well, you know, it doesn't matter where we \r\nstart our new life because we're going to be happy no matter what. And I am \r\ngoing to be the best mommy ever. It's just too bad your daddy can't be with us. \r\nYou know what, though? Maybe someday we will all be together, just the three of \r\nus -- you, me, and your dad -- and we will have the kind of life that I always \r\ndreamed of. But for now, that's just a dream. Hey, the only thing that matters \r\nis that we have each other. That's it. That's the most important thing. ",

        "Lucy: Put the basket down. I am going to lay out all the lunch, and then you \r\ngather everything we need for that badge, ok? Snap to it! ",
        "Serena: Can't I help? ",
        "Lucy: You helped. You carried this huge heavy picnic basket. That was a lot of \r\nhelp. ",
        "Serena: I know, but you drove. ",
        "Lucy: You're going to be driving one day. ",
        "Serena: Not soon enough. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, wait, don't sit there on that stump. There's, like, this licheny \r\nmossy-green slimy -- oh, no, and you already -- these new khakis have this \r\npolleny kind of stuff on it from the blooming stuff. ",
        "Serena: I can wipe it off. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you can. I'm sorry. I was just trying to help. ",
        "Serena: I'm not a baby, you know. ",
        "Lucy: You know, you've been saying that a lot to me lately. Is there \r\nsomething you're just kind of trying to give me a message about? Hey, we had \r\nthat deal, you know, that pinky swear that we would always, always be honest and \r\ntell each other everything, huh? ",
        "Serena: You really want to know? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Serena: Sometimes it bothers me when you and Dad treat me like a little kid. \r\nI'm almost a teenager. ",
        "Lucy: I know that. But see, it's kind of hard for me to accept. And sometimes \r\nI forget that you're almost already getting there, and I guess sometimes I want \r\nto try and forget that, so -- I'm sorry. Will you forgive me? ",
        "Serena: That's cool. Just as long as I know you know. But -- ",
        "Lucy: \"But.\" But what? ",
        "Serena: Could we save all this kissy Ladybug stuff for when it's just us? ",
        "Lucy: Us. Ok, you want to be treated like a young woman. I see that, and I \r\nappreciate it, and I will try to do that. I apologize. ",
        "Serena: I just wanted to set things straight. That's all. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Well, that's a very mature, adult-like decision to make then, \r\npumpkinhead. ",
        "Serena: Can we drop the whole pumpkinhead thing? ",
        "Lucy: Pumpkinhead! Pumpkinhead! Pumpkinhead! ",
        "[Serena laughs]",
        "Serena: That is torture! ",
        "Lucy: Torture? Do you you know what's torture for me? Not being able to hug \r\nyou every single day. Ok, listen, I will try to remember you are growing up very \r\nquickly, but just please, oh, please don't grow up too fast, ok? ",
        "Serena: I'll warn you first. ",
        "Lucy: Deal. What are we doing? We got to get to work. Come on. Time's \r\na-wasting. We need to figure out what we need for that Ladybug badge. List, \r\nlist. Where's the list? ",
        "Serena: Oh, list. List. Right here. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, what's first on the list? Let's see, let's see, let's see. ",
        "Serena: List, come on. ",
        "Lucy: What did you do? You rolled it up into this little tiny ball. Come on, \r\nwhat's first? We got to get going. ",
        "Serena: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: All right. ",
        "Serena: Ok, building a fire without a match. ",
        "Lucy: We can do that? ",
        "Serena: Yeah, I've been practicing with Victor. ",
        "Lucy: Really? ",
        "Serena: He taught me, just like in that Tom Hanks movie? ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Serena: He taught me even which sticks are best to use. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",

        "Lucy: You're out for a nice walk when you nearly scared us half to death. ",
        "Ian: Would you stop? Hey, ok, all right. ",
        "Lucy: My poor daughter here thought you were Bigfoot or something. ",
        "Ian: Woman, will you stop hitting me with your bloody purse, please. ",

        "Lucy: Ian, it means danger. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Lucy: Look, that card, it kept coming up when I was in the hospital. I lay \r\nthese cards out, and the Stranger kept coming up. It means danger for somebody \r\nor for you. ",
        "Ian: For me or someone else. ",
        "Lucy: I could tell you more. You know, we could do a private reading of those \r\ncards back at Port Charles. ",
        "Ian: Port Charles? It's a good idea. Why don't you guys pack up your stuff \r\nand go home? ",

Maybe we better get out of here, and \r\nwe'll come back and do your badge later, ok? Let's start packing up. Come on, \r\nsweetpea. Do you want me to give you a ride to your car back to town? ",

        "Eve: Thank you. It's perfect. ",
        "Michael: Perfect for travel. I thought it might be just what you needed to keep \r\nthe baby safe. ",
