        "Jack: Ok, here we go -- last batch. ",
        "Jamal: What's the point? ",
        "Jack: The point is it's our last chance to take pictures of Rebecca and that \r\nguy she supposedly killed. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and so what if we do? So what? ",
        "Jack: Well, hey, we're going to lay the pictures out in order and it's going \r\nto tell us what really happened over 120 years ago. ",
        "Jamal: So what? It still won't help Alison out or bring Kevin back, now, will \r\nit, Jack? Besides, no one even believes none of this stuff. They don't believe \r\nthe camera, the candles, the pictures that tell the whole story -- ",
        "Jack: Come on, hey. Come on. ",
        "Jamal: God! ",
        "Jack: Feel better now? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, right. I don't make anything better -- that's my big talent. But \r\nif Rafe was here -- if Rafe was here, he could make it all better. He'd make \r\neverything better. He's the best thing since the wheel, since -- ",
        "Jack: Yeah -- ",
        "Jamal: TV, VCR, DVDs, everything. ",
        "Jack: Would you take a deep breath? Rafe isn't here. Rafe is gone. ",
        "Jamal: Why don't you try telling that to Alison? She seems to feel like she'd \r\nbe cheating on him if her and I hooked up again. Yeah. Yeah, that's what she \r\nsaid. She feels like he's still around. And I'm beginning to wish that he was, \r\ntoo, because if he was, at least I'd have the pleasure of kicking his butt. ",
        "",
        "Alison: I really don't want to talk to you after what you said to Ian and \r\nLucy in court. ",
        "Alison: Hey, I got your message. What do you want? ",
        "Kate: What I want, Alison, is for you to sit down, relax, and enjoy this \r\nbeautiful day. I want you to start walking around like everything is normal. ",
        "Alison: Well, Kate, everything's not really that normal. ",
        "Kate: Listen, I know you're not happy with what I did in court. ",
        "Alison: \"Not happy?\" ",
        "Kate: But what I did, I had to do for you. Listen, we're on the same side. \r\nPlease try to remember that, Alison. ",
        "Alison: The only reason why I didn't fire you is because Lucy seems to think \r\nthat it's a good idea to keep you around. But it doesn't mean that I have to \r\nlike you. ",
        "Kate: You're not the first. ",
        "Alison: Well, that doesn't really surprise me. ",
        "Kate: And would it surprise you to hear that I don't lose very often? That's \r\nwhat counts. ",
        "Alison: That's not the only thing that counts, Kate. Listen to me -- you will \r\nnot drag Ian and Lucy through the mud like that ever again. You do it and \r\nyou're gone. Do you get that? ",
        "Kate: Got it. But let's just say for argument's sake that Ian and Lucy, or \r\nmaybe somebody else, was responsible for Kevin's death. ",
        "Alison: Kate -- Kate -- ",
        "Kate: Isn't it my job to try to explore all the possibilities? ",
        "Alison: No! Listen to me -- that is not your job. What your job is, is to \r\nprove that I am innocent and that Kevin is still alive and that he's just \r\nmissing or he's been kidnapped or something, and stare at me all you want -- I \r\ndon't really care -- but it's not going to change the fact of what I know and \r\nwhat I really feel. ",
        "Kate: And what do you know, Alison? Come on, there's something else going on. \r\nIt's ok. You can tell me. Talk to me. ",
        "Alison: I'm not going to talk to you about him, ok? ",
        "Kate: \"Him?\" Alison, who's got you all tied up in knots? ",

        "Rafe: Maybe, I don't know. ",
        "Vendor: So, what are you looking for, hmm? Oh -- for your special lady, \r\nright? ",
        "Rafe: Roses. Pink roses. ",
        "Vender: Well, just got some beauties in here, Romeo. Tell me how many would \r\nyou want. ",
        "Rafe: Let me see -- one, two, three, four, five, six -- all you got. ",
        "Vendor: What? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, all of them -- just every single pink rose that you can wrap up \r\nand send off with me. Come on, let's go. Livvie deserves them all. ",

        "Livvie: Well, you did what you came here to do, Livvie, and that is the end \r\nof Alison and Rafe -- for good. ",

        "Jack: So, you want to kick Rafe's butt, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, my gosh -- big time. You know, he had to know how Alison felt \r\nabout him, and then he still leaves. Dude, what kind of a guy does that? And why \r\nis she still holding on to him? ",
        "Jack: You're asking me to explain women? ",
        "Jamal: I don't know, I don't know. Maybe I should take some responsibility \r\nfor some of this. ",
        "Jack: Huh? ",
        "Jamal: If I hadn't acted like a fool and pushed her away, then she never \r\nwould've turned to that chump. ",
        "Jack: You're still beating yourself up over this, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, I will always beat myself up over this. I mean, I blew a \r\ngreat thing that we had and now that I see that there's a way to get it back -- \r\nit just hurts. ",
        "Jack: I'm not going to lie to you -- you did mess up with Alison. ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. ",
        "Jack: But, hey, you got to give it time, Jamal, you know? Let time pass, and \r\nI guarantee you, I think things will work out. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, ok. What are you going to do, wave your magic wand or something?\r\n",
        "Jack: No. We're going to let time be your magic. ",
        "Jamal: Oh. Did you catch that on, like, a greeting card? Is that where you \r\ngot that from? ",
        "Jack: Rafe is not coming back. And sooner or later, Alison's going to realize \r\nthat. Might be a week, it might be a day, it might be a year. But in the \r\nmeantime, you're going to have to wait. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Kate, the last thing that I want to talk to you about is a guy, ok? \r\nMy guy. ",
        "Kate: Listen, I know in court I seem like a real hardass, but I'm not -- ",
        "Alison: I know -- tough on the outside and I'm sure very sweet and squishy on \r\nthe inside. No edges, right? ",
        "Kate: You should see my stuffed animal collection. ",
        "Alison: Well, at least you can fake it. You know, and you seem like you're \r\nall in control on the outside, so good for you. ",
        "Kate: Nursing a broken heart makes it tough. So I'm guessing Mr. Wonderful \r\nturned out not to be so wonderful after all? ",
        "Alison: No, he is. I mean, you know, he was -- he is, whatever. I don't know.\r\n",
        "Kate: So who is -- was he? ",
        "Alison: He's a guy that's not coming back. ",
        "Kate: And you still think he's wonderful? ",
        "Alison: He was such a good man. He was so sweet, he was so -- he was so \r\nloving. And the reason why he left -- well, it wasn't -- it wasn't his choice.\r\n",
        "Kate: Well, he sounds like the kind of guy who wouldn't want you to sacrifice \r\nyourself for him. ",
        "Alison: No, he's not. ",
        "Kate: Sounds like the kind of guy who would tell you to fight like hell and \r\ntry to stay focused. ",
        "Alison: That's right. ",
        "Kate: The kind of guy who, win or lose your case, would shower you with \r\nbouquets. ",
        "Alison: No, not bouquets, just -- just one perfect pink rose. ",
        "Kate: So why'd he leave? ",
        "Alison: Because he's -- he's an angel and -- ",

        "Rafe: Nothing. What's wrong with you? ",
        "Livvie: Nothing. I -- I just wasn't expecting to see you out here like -- \r\nlike this waiting. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I was waiting for you. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, well, I just had to run a couple of errands, you know. Market, \r\nbakery -- ",
        "Rafe: Here, here. Let me take that for you. Let's go. We're going to have a \r\nnice dinner. ",
        "Livvie: Rafe, what's going on? ",
        "Rafe: Well, I actually ran a couple errands myself. ",

        "Rafe: I decided to pick up a couple things. ",
        "Livvie: I thought you knew you were supposed to stay in and -- ",
        "Rafe: Stay in and take it easy. I know, but I had a really good reason for \r\ngoing out. ",

        "Jack: You know what? Hold on right there. You and Ali are one thing, me and \r\nLivvie are another. I mean, come on, she tried to kill me, let alone go behind \r\nmy back with vampires and stupid college geeks and now whoever she has up in \r\nthis cabin. You wanted to kick Rafe's butt? I wanted to kick my own butt for \r\nbeing a chump. But you know what? Never again. Nope -- I'm done, through. What? \r\nWhat's so funny? Did I say something funny? Come on. ",
        "Jamal: No, I'm sorry. I just -- I don't know. Something about what you just \r\nsaid, it kind of made me feel a little bit better, I guess. ",
        "Jack: Well, it's probably these chemicals you've been breathing for the past \r\nfew days, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, probably. ",
        "Jack: All right, let's go, let's get back to work. We have a case to solve.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Oh, right. ",
        "Jack: I think the image is coming in. Yeah, it's starting to come in. You \r\nknow the drill, right? ",

        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Here it is, it's Horatio and -- ",

        "Kate: Alison, of everything you've told me, this -- ",
        "Alison: Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Don't even bother. Ok, \r\ndon't worry about it. I know, I'm nuts. I am crazy. I see people -- I see \r\ndead people and they come out of paintings and I talk to them over lattes -- \r\nwell, I do -- and now I'm in love with an angel. That's great. That's fine. You \r\nknow, I should've -- I should've known that you would never believe me. ",
        "Kate: There are lots of people who believe in another dimension to life, in \r\nparanormal and metaphysical things. ",
        "Alison: Right. But you are not one of those people, are you? ",
        "Kate: Look, you can believe in anything you want to. But when it comes to \r\ncourt, trust me, you cannot come in and talk about ghosts or magic or angels or \r\nanything like that, or the prosecution will make it seem like you are going \r\ntotally out of your mind. ",
        "Alison: Ok, all right. But the truth is I didn't kill Kevin! And nobody did, \r\nbut they won't listen to exactly what happened. ",
        "Kate: Well, then stop wasting your breath trying. ",
        "Alison: Fine, ok. But Livvie, now, she's another story. She's going to get up \r\non the stand and she's going to tell all kinds of lies, I guarantee -- ",
        "Kate: Let her. Let her. Alison, we have a very good shot of clearing \r\nyou, and Livvie -- Livvie is their weak link. ",
        "Alison: Livvie? ",
        "Kate: My specialty in court is people who lie on the stand. I'll get her up \r\nthere, I'll lay into her, and we'll be mopping up what's left over. ",
        "Alison: See, I guess you are kind of tough. ",
        "Kate: In court, you bet, and you better be, too -- ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Kate: Because you cannot wait for some prince charming to ride in and rescue \r\nyou. ",

        "Kate: Alison, you need to find some way to try to tell prince charming \r\ngood-bye. Now, a true prince would understand. You need to be able to move on.\r\n",

        "Livvie: I can't believe it. Just look at them all. Did you buy the whole \r\nstore out, Rafe? ",

        "Kate: First, I'm going after that lying ex-girlfriend of yours, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Hey, no problem here. ",
        "Kate: And, second, when we get to court, no more of that woo-woo talk. ",
        "Jamal: \"Woo-woo talk?\" ",
        "Kate: Magic candles, talking portraits from the haunted gallery -- none of \r\nthat stuff. ",
        "Jack: Right, right. ",

        "Jamal: Look, I felt just like you did when I first heard about this. ",

        "Jamal: No. When I went with Jack to the barn and watched him take a bunch of \r\npictures of nothing but an empty room, then we went back and developed the \r\nplates, there Rebecca was -- one picture after another, just telling the story \r\nof what happened to her 120 years back. ",

        "Alison's Voice: I'm serious. Like the best kind of magic. Ok. When we're \r\ndrinking hot chocolate, it's like the simplest of things. When we drink hot \r\nchocolate together, it's like the best birthdays or the best New Year's Eve or \r\nthe best Christmases all rolled into one. You know what I -- or like that one \r\nperfect pink rose he gave me. Oh, so sweet. You know, all I did is I -- I \r\ntouched his face and he smiled and -- and then I just touched his arm and he \r\nwould, like, shiver, you know, and it would make me shiver and then we would \r\nshiver together.
