        "Livvie: Why make things worse? Jamal told you not to come. ",
        "Jack: Look, you know that whole Alison thing -- you know, me kissing her was \r\na stupid misunderstanding. ",
        "Livvie: Jamal knows that, Jack. ",
        "Jack: And I'm not going to let it wreck our friendship. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, would you listen to me? Jamal is your friend. He didn't want \r\nyou to come because you've been sick and not because of Alison. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I'm staying, all right? If you want to go home, that's fine.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh! Jack, what are you trying to prove? ",
        "Jack: Jamal needs my help, all right, even if he's too proud to admit it. Now \r\nthe question is, where the hell is he? ",
        "Sam: Hi, Jack. ",
        "Zach: Where's Jamal? Suiting up? ",
        "Jack: I haven't seen him. ",
        "Zach: What are you talking about? ",
        "Jack: I don't know where he's at, Zach. What part of that do you not \r\nunderstand? ",
        "Zach: If Jamal doesn't show, you're going to have that cycle shop all to \r\nyourself. Nobody crosses me. ",
        "Jack: Hey, Zach, relax. We've still got time before the race starts. ",
        "Zach: Check the bike area. See if Jamal's hanging there, huh? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Where could they be? ",
        "Jack: I don't know. But we've got to find them fast. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Yeah, I did it, and I'm glad. ",
        "Jamal: Glad? Glad? Ali, what are you crazy, throwing away my keys like that, \r\nhuh? What are you trying to do to me? ",
        "Alison: Correction. What I am trying to do for you and for myself is \r\nsave your life. That's what. ",
        "Jamal: I've got to be back at the starting area. Ali, where's my cell phone?\r\n",
        "Alison: Right next to mine back at the tent, where I left it. ",
        "Jamal: You're proud of yourself, aren't you? ",
        "Alison: As a matter of fact, yeah. Look, Jamal, when that guy asked you to \r\nwear that black armband today for the rider that was killed -- ",
        "Jamal: Just help me look, Ali. ",
        "Alison: That is what clinched it for me. You are not riding in this \r\nrace. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, you have overstepped way too far this time. You have no idea, \r\nAli, what you've done. ",

        "Michael: Eve? ",
        "Eve: Michael. Come on in. ",
        "Michael: Thank you. ",
        "Eve: I was just imagining what life could have been like had things gone \r\ndifferently. My husband and I would be rocking our baby to sleep in this \r\nbeautiful cradle that you made. It's lovely. ",
        "Michael: I'm glad you like it. I was just wondering if you'd chosen a \r\ndestination yet. ",
        "Eve: Wow, here's your hat. What's your hurry? ",
        "Michael: Oh, I don't mean to rush you. ",
        "Eve: Oh, come on. Shame on you, Father Michael. You know the church frowns on \r\npriests telling even the smallest little lies. That's ok. I understand. I know \r\nthat you need your space. And I need to find out what I'm going to do with my \r\nlife next. I just need to find out where to go. ",
        "Michael: I know this is a difficult decision for you, so I took the liberty \r\nof doing a little research. Seems like a beautiful place. ",
        "Eve: The Appalachians. \"Bounds Corners.\" Gee, I like the name of that. ",
        "Michael: It's a little village in this little valley. Green hills. Very \r\npeaceful. Low crime rate. ",
        "Eve: Economically depressed. ",
        "Michael: The community's kind of cut off from the rest of the world. There's \r\nno highway for miles. The people are money poor. But from what I've read, in \r\neverything that expands the heart and soul, they're rich. It's a perfect place \r\nfor you and your baby to flourish. ",
        "Eve: And you think they need me at their clinic? ",
        "Michael: Well, they've been praying for a doctor for a long time. The only \r\ndoctor they have travels 150 miles from Wheeling once a month. ",
        "Eve: Oh, that's not good, not at all. ",
        "Michael: This lady here, Edna Hall. She's the president of the clinic. That's \r\nher number. ",
        "Eve: Edna Hall. Looks like you've got yourself a doctor. Well, if she gives \r\nme the green light, I think I can catch a flight tonight. ",

        "Karen: Frank? No Frank. Nellie. ",
        "Frank's Voice: The prince comes across this contraption. Kind of a time \r\nmachine, only it didn't really look like a time machine. More like a piece of \r\njunk from a long time ago. The prince convinced the queen he came from the \r\nfuture. He pleaded with her to help him set things right, put them back on their \r\nproper path. The young queen was scared for she knew this would mean sending the \r\nprince back to 2001. ",
        "Karen's Voice: So did he do it? Did he get her to help him? ",
        "Frank's Voice: He told the queen if she did this, she would never be alone.\r\n",
        "Rhonda's Voice: He was there. He used to talk to me. He was there when \r\nCarolyn died. He used to tell me that I had my whole life ahead of me, and, you \r\nknow, when I was feeling sadder than I ever felt in my whole life, he gave me \r\nhope, and he told me that I wouldn't always feel this alone. ",
        "Frank's Voice: It worked. I did it. You're here. You're really here. Oh, I \r\nlove that laugh. I love that face. Those -- those lips. That nose. I love you.\r\n",
        "Karen's Voice: I love you, too. ",
        "Frank's Voice: Oh, say it again. ",
        "Karen's Voice: I love you, too. ",

        "Karen's Voice: You're acting like you haven't seen me in years. ",

        "Alison: Jamal, please don't do this! ",
        "Jamal: Ali, they're going to be lowering the flag in a little while. I've got \r\nto be there. Stop it. ",
        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Jamal: Look, because I said I would, ok? I gave them my word. ",

        "Jamal: It is one race, ok? That's it. Just one. ",
        "Alison: No! No, it's not. This isn't about Zach, ok? You love these machines. \r\nYou love the power that they hold, all right? It turns you on. And you're a good \r\nracer, too. You're almost too good. ",

        "Livvie: Oh! Jamal's voice mail. Great. And neither of them have their cell \r\nphones turned on. ",

        "Karen: I was looking for Frank. ",
        "Mary: Well, if you find him, will you tell him it's never too late for spring \r\ncleaning? Do you believe this mess? My son the pack rat. You know, and I thought \r\nthese pictures were lost or thrown away or something, and look at them. They're \r\nhere. Are you -- are you ok? Should you be out this soon after surgery? ",
        "Karen: I'm fine. I really need to see Frank. ",
        "Mary: I can see that in your eyes. Look, he's going to kill me for showing \r\nthis, but look at this picture of Frank in his Superman cape -- made out of a \r\nbeach towel -- protecting his little brother, Joe. Aren't they the cutest? ",
        "Karen: Oh, that is so cute. ",
        "Mary: Look at this. ",
        "Karen: Oh. You know, it must be nice to have all those memories on film. \r\nYeah, I wish my mom and I had more photos. You know, you knew my mom in the old \r\ndays, didn't you? I mean, before I was born. ",
        "Mary: I sure did. Why, I've known her since she was a teenager. Poor darling. \r\nShe was so devastated when her sister died. I was afraid she'd never recover.\r\n",
        "Karen: You know, she mentioned a young man, a stranger in town, that was very \r\nkind to her back then. In fact, she credited him for helping her through most of \r\nher grief. A handsome young man. Early 30s, dark. Do you remember someone like \r\nthat? ",
        "Mary: Yeah. He came here to the house once. We had a nice chat in the \r\nkitchen. I remember that. And he told me that he'd made a mistake that he had to \r\nfix to get back to the woman he loved. ",
        "Karen: Did he mention her name? ",
        "Mary: No, no. But I think the mistake involved your mother in some way, but I \r\n-- you know what? I can't remember anything else. Oh, you know what? I left my \r\ncell phone in the car. I'm expecting a call from Victor. I'm going to leave \r\nthese here. I'll be right back. ",

        "Jamal: And what, Spunky, hmm? ",
        "Alison: I don't know, ok? I'm sorry. This isn't like some majorly thought-out \r\nstrategy. I was just trying to save you. ",
