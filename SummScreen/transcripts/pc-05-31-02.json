        "Alison: It's gone. The heart with our names in it, mine and Rafe's, it's \r\ngone. Livvie. God, Livvie must have worn it away. But she can't -- she can't \r\nerase our love. Not ever. ",

        "Rafe: That feels so good. ",
        "Livvie: How good? ",
        "Rafe: So good. ",
        "Livvie: You know, you always used to love it when I touched you like this. So \r\nclose your eyes. Close your eyes and just let yourself feel. Feel how much I \r\nlove you. Feel it in my fingers. ",
        "Alison's Voice: I touched his face, and he smiled and -- and then I just \r\ntouched his arm, and he would, like, shiver, you know? And it would make me \r\nshiver, and then we would shiver together. ",
        "Livvie: Shiver. There. You see? Now, that's the sign. That's how I know. ",
        "Rafe: Know what? ",
        "Livvie: That you really are happy. It's that little shiver that goes up your \r\nspine that tells me you are all mine. ",
        "Rafe: Thank you for helping me learn how to love again. ",
        "Livvie: Well, thank you for teaching me how to make love. You know, it was \r\nalways so incredible. Well -- no, no, no, not yet. ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Livvie: But I promise, it'll be worth it. I promise. ",

        "Ian: I got to go through with it -- for Lucy. Got to see through to the end, \r\nwhatever the end may be. Just got a migraine. ",
        "Chris: No, this isn't just a migraine. There's been some sort of shock to \r\nyour system. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. I found the aspirin for you. Here you go. ",
        "Ian: Oh, thanks. Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Um -- thank you. Really -- thank you for doing this. ",
        "Ian: Anything, you know that. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but I hope you know, if there was any other way that I could \r\nthink of to try to do this, I would. I know how much this is taking out of you. \r\nYou probably would like some water with those aspirin. I'll get you some. \r\nListen, I am very glad that it's you Kevin decided to communicate to after \r\neverything we've been through. ",
        "Ian: Don't leave me like this. ",
        "Lucy: I'm -- I'm just going to run and get you some water. I'll be right \r\nback. ",
        "Ian: I need you. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Ian: You're all I been thinking about. I need to be with you. ",

        "Rafe: I -- I thought you wanted this. ",
        "Livvie: I do. I really, really do. I've been waiting so long for this moment, \r\nRafe, so long to make love to you again, but I -- I really want to look \r\nbeautiful for you. ",
        "Rafe: You already do. ",
        "Livvie: Shh. Just give me a couple of minutes, ok? I want this to be really \r\nspecial, something you'll remember always. ",
        "Rafe: That's what I want, too. I want to remember everything. Oh, my God, \r\nyou've been so patient, so incredibly patient and caring, and I just want to be \r\nable to give you everything -- everything you want, everything you need. ",
        "Livvie: You will, Rafe, I promise, you will. ",
        "Rafe: I'll always try. ",

        "Lucy: Ian, what are you -- what are you saying? I don't understand. ",

        "Kevin: So much. Nothing else matters. I just want to hold you in my arms and \r\nnever let go. I miss you so much. ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- it's you. Doc? ",
        "Ian: It feels like part of me is missing. ",

        "Kevin: I know you're as desperate as I am, wondering what happened. \r\nConcentrate, Lucy. The connection you believe we've always had, I'm trying to --\r\n",
        "Ian: Get back to you. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I know, and I'm trying to find you. I'm trying. You keep \r\ntrying. Would you try? Come on, Doc, try! ",

        "Rebecca: Just what? ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's kind of hard to explain. I was -- I was trying to let my \r\nwife know that I'm all right. Sounds foolish, I know. ",
        "Rebecca: Not at all. I was able to speak through my portrait, and I believe \r\nthere are other ways. I know belief is the source of all power. And I still \r\nbelieve that love can move mountains. So why not? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, why not? Power of love. Ok, come on. Power of love. ",
        "Ian: Come on! ",

        "Alison: See, Livvie, you thought that by ruining a thing or a symbol, it \r\nwould actually mean something, but I don't -- I don't need names on a wall to \r\nremember Rafe. I don't actually need anything. Like I could ever forget him or \r\nlike I ever would. ",
        "Alison's Voice: Loving you -- it's changed my life and it's changed me and \r\nthat's something to celebrate. It's something to rejoice in. Let's do that. \r\nLet's stand before God, just you and me, right here, right now. And let's -- \r\nlet's make a promise to each other, a vow that even though we won't really be \r\ntogether, our hearts will always be joined for all eternity. Will you do that \r\nwith me? Will you marry me? ",

        "Kevin: I -- I wish I knew. I -- it seemed for a moment, I felt -- I don't \r\nknow. I just know that if it were Lucy, she'd go to the ends of the earth and \r\nback. ",

        "Ian: What just happened here? What was that? ",
        "Lucy: It -- it was Doc. Ian, listen to me. It happened again. He connected \r\nthrough you and he was talking through you. I know it was Doc. It was his words. \r\nI'm sure of it. ",
        "Ian: At least somebody's sure of something. I don't remember. ",
        "Lucy: Can you remember anything? Did you -- did you see anything? What -- \r\nwhat did you feel? ",
        "Ian: I remember seeing you through a fog, talking. And this piercing pain in \r\nmy head. It was like my whole body was coming apart at the seams. Like I was \r\ngoing to pass out. ",

        "Kevin: Do you think I'm in the mood for a picnic? Don't you understand yet \r\nwhat your trick with your candle has done to our lives? ",
        "Rebecca: Of course I do, but it was your daughter, Livvie, who made it into a \r\npermanent problem by slashing -- ",

        "Kevin: No! No, Not indefinitely. That, I will not accept. ",
        "Rebecca: I've been here for over 100 years. Don't you think if there was a \r\nway to get out, I would have found it? So just like me, you may never leave. \r\nForgive me, Kevin. ",

We can bring him back, but how? How? We have to have a seance. \r\nNo -- Rebecca's dead. Doc's not dead. There has to be some explanation. How \r\ncould Doc be with her when he's not dead?
