        "Jamal: I told Jack not to come. What happened? ",
        "Livvie: He wanted to be here. He thought you'd need backup. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but how'd he end up racing? I mean, why does Zach even want him \r\nto? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. But when you didn't show, it suddenly became really \r\nimportant that someone take your place. ",
        "Jamal: Zach wanted me to race because I can win, ok? Jack has never even \r\nraced before. There's no way he --",

        "Michael: Until I rebuild what's been damaged. What? ",

        "Karen: I know it sounds crazy, wondering if the story about the prince going \r\nback in time is true. I mean, it's insane, isn't it? To think that the prince \r\nwanting to make sure that the parents of the princess get together so she'll \r\nexist for him to love has anything to do with us. But I can't get it out of my \r\nhead.

She said there was this guy that helped her after her sister died \r\n-- you know, talked to her and stuff. Well, if it wasn't for him, she wouldn't \r\nhave gone to the dance. His name was Frank. He said he was from the future. ",
        "Frank: Karen -- ",

        "Frank: My mom? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. I bumped into her in here, in the garage, and we started talking \r\n-- ",
        "Frank: About the past? ",
        "Karen: Frank told Mary he was trying to fix a mistake to get back the woman \r\nhe loved, just like your fairy tale. You think I'm insane, don't you? ",
        "Frank: No, no. Look, I don't think you're crazy. I told you I believe if you \r\nlove someone enough you can do anything, even go back in time. ",
        "Karen: Tell me, Frank, why do you believe that? ",
        "Frank: What -- what happened here? ",
