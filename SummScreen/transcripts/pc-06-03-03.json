        "Elizabeth goes to Lucy for help finding Alison, but Lucy has lost all her self-confidence. Elizabeth assures her that even if she's no longer a slayer, she's still very much in tune with the universe. Taking this to heart, Lucy gets out her crystal ball, but she collapses before being able to use it. Elizabeth takes her to the hospital for help. Determined to get more of his wonder drug, Kevin tries to con Karen into helping him, but as a former junkie, she's onto him. She offers to help him beat this with real treatment, but she won't do anything to enable him to get more of the drug. Desperate for blood, Ian goes to Chris, who is stunned by Ian's marked increase in blood consumption. Although Ian doesn't want to give a reason for the change, Chris reminds his colleague that he's putting a lot on the line for him. Realizing that Ian is terrified that he will lose control and bite Lucy, Chris agrees to supply as much blood as he needs. Rafe intervenes just as Jamal prepares to participate in his first feeding with a vampire named Stacey. Surprised to see that Jamal has been turned, the slayer demands to know where Alison is, and he turns violent when Jamal refuses to cooperate. A young nurse finds Jamal on the ground, but he gets up and rushes away without allowing her to help. When Joshua tells Alison that he and her father were childhood best friends, she accuses him of lying. She comes up with her own idea of his past, which Joshua admits is painfully true. After leaving her, Joshua makes a mental note to praise Jamal for his help with her. Alison is stunned when Rafe appears in her room."

        "Karen: You mean those drugs you've been taking?",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I think you're right. I need some help.",
        "Karen: I'm glad to hear you finally admit that. Come on, let's talk over here.",
        "Kevin: You know, what I think would work best for me is some kind of a program, a group session kind of thing.",
        "Karen: I think that's a great idea.",
        "Kevin: I thought Frank would know a good place to go. You haven't seen him, have you?",
        "Karen: I don't understand. Why do you need to talk to Frank?",
        "Kevin: He's been through this kind of thing.",
        "Karen: Well, so have I, Kevin. I could recommend quite a few treatment centers.",
        "Kevin: No. No, I'd like to talk to frank.",
        "Karen: Frank's the last person you go to for help -- unless there's some other help you're talking about.",

        "Ian: Ramsey.",
        "Chris: Oh, it's only you. Thought it might be Caleb and Livvie again.",
        "Ian: Again?",
        "Chris: Yeah, they just paid me a little visit last night.",
        "Ian: What'd they want?",
        "Chris: Nothing much. They just wanted me to analyze some residue on a piece of glass. Think they were looking for an antidote or something.",
        "Ian: I'll bet they were.",
        "Chris: You know something about this?",
        "Ian: Um -- did you help them or not?",
        "Chris: I really couldn't. It was just sugar water.",
        "Ian: Good.",
        "Chris: What do you know that I don't?",
        "Ian: Let's not worry about that right now. I need to get more packets from you.",
        "Chris: Look, I've already given you enough o-neg to feed an army of bats. Is the hunger getting worse?",
        "Ian: Never mind the hunger! Just get me the blood, would you?",
        "[Ian snarls]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: You -- you -- you wanted to bite me. What are you doing? Where are you going?",
        "Ian: I'm leaving. I can't be here with you. I'm moving out.",

        "Lucy: Ian. Ian? Ian.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Lucy, thank God you're home. Lucy, you've got to help me. You're the only person that can help me. Oh, God, you've been crying.",
        "Lucy: It's -- sorry. It's Ian. He -- he left. He's gone.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, thank God.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, no. Oh, I'm so sorry. No, listen, I didn't mean it like that. Lucy, he loves you so much. He'll be back. He adores you. I just said that because I was so afraid that you'd heard something about Alison.",
        "Lucy: Wait, what are you talking about? What about Alison?",
        "Elizabeth: Joshua has her. He's taken her again. You're the only one that can help me find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: I'm sorry you didn't like what the chef prepared for you. You can ask for anything you'd like, you know. I would do anything for you -- within reason, of course.",
        "Alison: I don't suppose you'd let me leave here?",
        "Joshua: I thought perhaps after our little talk last night, you might see me differently, not as the monster that you think I am.",
        "Alison: I don't understand this obsession with my family.",
        "Joshua: Obsession?",
        "Alison: I mean, first there was my mother that you went after, and then you turned my grandmother, and then you come after me and you want to make me your bride, a woman who clearly doesn't want to be with you and is in love with another man. I call that an obsession and I don't understand it.",
        "Joshua: I explained to you, Alison --",
        "Alison: Oh, I know, you explained. I'm everything that you thought you could never have. Whatever. I -- save it, ok?",
        "Joshua: I think you underestimate yourself. You can't imagine that perhaps I just desire you? I want you more than I've ever wanted any other woman.",
        "Alison: Oh, please. Stop. Don't even go there. We both know it's more than that.",
        "Joshua: Well, I'd like to tell you it was more than that, I'd like to be able to say that I love you, but I don't, you see, because, quite frankly, I don't know what love is.",
        "Alison: Let's just get to the point. What is it that you want with me, Joshua, hmm?",
        "Joshua: This has to do with your father.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Joshua: Your father, Malcolm, and I were friends. He helped make me what I am today.",

        "Jamal: All right, look, you might as well come out and show yourself because I know you're there, all right, so you're either going to come out or I'm going to come back there and get you. Stacey?",
        "Stacey: How did you know I was there?",
        "Jamal: How did I know? You sounded like a herd of elephants trampling through the brush. That's how I knew.",
        "Stacey: And here I was trying to be so quiet.",
        "Jamal: So what are you doing and why are you following me?",
        "Stacey: Frank told me to keep an eye on you.",
        "Jamal: Did he?",
        "Stacey: It's not a bad job. I actually kind of like it.",
        "Jamal: Yeah? Well, I don't.",
        "Stacey: Come on, Jamal. Now that it's out, I don't have to hide, and who knows, you might even grow to like having me around. I mean, we could even make it fun, if you know what I mean.",
        "Jamal: No. I don't know what you mean. Could you please explain?",
        "Stacey: You haven't fed yet, have you? You're a virgin.",
        "Jamal: Girl, get out of here with that virgin stuff, ok, please.",
        "Stacey: A virgin vampire. No, it's ok. I'll teach you everything you need to know.",
        "Rafe: What the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: How did this happen? Joshua got to Alison how? Wait a minute, are you sure that he even has her?",
        "Elizabeth: I'm positive, I'm positive.",
        "Lucy: Ok, then where's Rafe?",
        "Elizabeth: Last I saw him, he was at Elixir tearing the place up trying to find Joshua.",
        "Lucy: And?",
        "Elizabeth: Nobody knows where they are, Lucy. That's why I'm here. You're the only person that can help me find her.",
        "Lucy: I can't. I -- I -- I really wish I could help you, Elizabeth, but I cannot. I don't have my slayer powers anymore. They're gone.",
        "Elizabeth: What? No, no, no, that can't be true.",
        "Lucy: It is true and I have all these people I need to help. They need my help so badly, and I can not do a damn thing about it. I -- Ian -- I couldn't help him anymore, and Victor, and I can't even help Rafe fight the good fight, so I sure as heck cannot help you. I have become absolutely useless.",
        "Elizabeth: No, don't you dare say that you are useless, Lucy. Slayer or not, you're the strongest woman I have ever known. You can help me find Alison, and you can help me do it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: What do you think I'm doing? You can't figure that out for yourself, slayer?",
        "Rafe: I didn't realize that you'd been turned.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, you know, there's a lot of that going around town.",
        "Rafe: Huh. Wait a minute, when did this happen?",
        "Jamal: Oh, it doesn't matter.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it does. I'm looking for Alison.",
        "Jamal: Hmm.",
        "Rafe: Joshua took her, and if you're working for him, then you know where she is.",
        "Jamal: Well, I can't help you with that, my brother. Have a good day. You trying to impress me?",
        "Rafe: You know where she is, don't you? Start talking!",
        "Jamal: Look, I don't answer to you, slayer. I never have, and I sure as hell ain't going to start answering to you now.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what, you might want to rethink that, vampire, because they don't call me slayer for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How is that you were friends with my father?",
        "Joshua: My mother worked for your family as a domestic. She was a housekeeper.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Joshua: Yes, and your father and I were the only two youngsters of a like age on that vast estate, so we were constant companions. We were the very best of friends.",
        "Alison: That's funny because he never mentioned you ever.",
        "Joshua: Well, I'm not surprised. As we grew older, things changed. He started to treat me less of a friend and more of a servant. When his real friends were around, he had me banished to quarters.",
        "Alison: Wow, that's so awful.",
        "Joshua: That's why I wouldn't give up. I so wanted his friendship, his approval. I wanted to be a part of his group. But the more that I tried, the more impossible it became. You see, he was very much upstairs and I was downstairs, and never the twain shall meet.",
        "Alison: Go on. And then?",
        "Joshua: Well, then one day, I decided to stop trying. One day, I really did just give up and on that day, I convinced myself that I only needed two things in this world. One was money and the other was power -- money to buy the friends that I wanted and power over the people that tried to put me down, power to tell them all to go to hell, like your father, Malcolm. That's the lesson he taught me. I'd say he taught me rather well, wouldn't you?",
        "Alison: Is that why you decided to kill him?",
        "Joshua: What?",
        "Alison: Oh, don't play stupid with me. I know that was part of the original plan all along -- yours and Caleb's -- to kill my father so that my mother would have no choice but to come back to Port Charles, and then you would take it from there!",
        "Joshua: I did not kill your father.",
        "Alison: I don't believe you.",
        "Joshua: Malcolm was my friend. I loved him like I would love a brother. Whatever harm came to him, it was nothing to do with me.",
        "Alison: Are you finished yet? Because I think that's the biggest lie I've ever heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You're overreacting.",
        "Karen: Oh, really? You come to me with some sob story about wanting to kick the habit, and all along all you want is score to more drugs.",
        "Kevin: I don't like what you're insinuating. All I want --",
        "Karen: I know what you want -- to find your supplier, Frank Scanlon. Listen, Kevin, I'll help you kick this habit, ok, I will do whatever it takes, but I'll never help you score more drugs.",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry.",
        "Karen: Do you want me to help you find treatment?",
        "Kevin: No, I'm actually working with someone already. It's an addiction specialist. She's great. Seems I have a way to go yet.",
        "Karen: Well, it takes time.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, it would go a lot smoother if I knew what was in it. Joshua told me it was vitamins and herbs, things like that, but obviously there's more to it.",
        "Karen: Yeah, obviously.",
        "Kevin: Wait, you ran tests on it, didn't you?",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Kevin: Well, I told the doctor I'm working with that I'd let her know what's in it so they can devise the proper treatment.",
        "Karen: What this doctor's name? I'll call her.",
        "Kevin: Nah, you know what? You've done enough. I'll handle it myself.",
        "Karen: I'm not stupid. I used to be a junkie myself and I know every trick in the book. You just want a list of ingredients so you can make this drug for yourself.",
        "Kevin: You don't understand. This stuff has changed my life for the better! For the first time in months, I feel like myself again. I'm calm. I don't feel anger, I don't feel paranoia. And creatively, it's amazing. I'm painting like I never had before. It's incredible!",
        "Karen: Kevin --",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm telling you that I need this stuff. Karen, I need it!",
        "Karen: I know. I know!",
        "Kevin: Then help me! Help me! Look, I promise, I -- I'll do one more fix and then I'll get clean.",
        "Karen: But you won't, because one more will never be enough. You'll want another and another after that.",
        "Kevin: I'm begging you, Karen. You have to help me with this.",
        "Karen: And I told you I will help you kick this. That's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Ian, I have been charting your progress and you've been getting by easily on two, three liters a week. Now, your consumption has gone through the roof. I got to ask you why.",
        "Ian: That's my business.",
        "Chris: No, it's our business. Ok, when I chose to help you, you told me you would be honest with me about all your symptoms.",
        "Ian: I'm not one of your lab rats, Ramsey.",
        "Chris: No, but you're a doctor, Ian, and you know how much I'm putting my ass on the line by helping you here. Now, I could lose my license, I could go to jail, or even worse. So if I'm choosing to document this, that's the price you're going to have to pay.",
        "Ian: Document this. I'm using everything that is in me not to feed on someone, not to plunge my fangs into some innocent neck and turn them into the living dead, and that's why I need the blood. Do you understand that?",
        "Chris: I understand that you're not worried about anybody innocent. it's someone specific. It's Lucy, isn't it? I'll get you whatever you need.",
        "Ian: Thank you. I'm --",
        "Chris: Yeah, I know. I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound harsh. It's just that if I didn't think that you could handle this, I wouldn't ask it of you. But, Lucy, I know that you can do this. You can always do anything that you put your mind to. That's what I've always admired about you. So let's just focus and I know that you can help me find Alison.",
        "Lucy: Elizabeth, God, shut up. Please leave me alone.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, please just do it for Alison then. Do it for Alison. Lucy, you've been like a mother to her, more of a mother than I was. You were always there for her when I wasn't. And she needs you now. She needs you now.",
        "Lucy: I -- you don't understand. I am not what I was before.",
        "Elizabeth: So you're not a slayer? So what? What about your instincts? Lucy, you have that intuition that you're so famous for. Alison was always telling me about, \"oh, Lucy's so in touch with the universe.\" You had all of that before you were ever a slayer.",
        "Lucy: Before.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, you did! So let's do that. Let's get out the tarot cards and the crystal ball and your magic stones and let's find her!",
        "Lucy: Ok, who is it I am sitting here talking to?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, it's me. People don't often get to hear me be so --",
        "Lucy: Um -- maybe so right? You know, maybe you are right. Maybe I'm being really stupid sitting here doing absolutely nothing, because the universe still has to be out there. I mean, we wouldn't be here if she wasn't.",
        "Elizabeth: Exactly.",
        "Lucy: And maybe she's sending me messages, so I should go try and find Alison. Maybe I can see her.",
        "Elizabeth: I know you can.",
        "Lucy: So maybe I should stop sitting here and get up and go find my tarot cards and my stuff.",
        "Elizabeth: You all right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'm fine. Something happens when I get up too fast, that's all. I have everything right here. I've got my tarot cards and I've got my crystals, and I've even got my crystal ball. Now, she is a little dusty, you know, but maybe just with a little cleanup, she can be fi--",
        "Elizabeth: Lucy? Lucy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'll tell you what I do think is true.",
        "Joshua: Go on.",
        "Alison: I'm guessing that you lived in some sort of little town in England. Some average, middle-class family, small, little town. I'm guessing maybe Birmingham or Bristol. Right? Some sort of gray, industrial town that you feared that you'd never escape from. But you were determine to do so, and once you perfected that snotty little demeanor of yours, you started to worm your way into people lives, people that could help you climb to the top of the ladder. But once you got to be king and you got to reign, you were so bittersweet because you knew that no matter how much money or power you actually obtained, you would never achieve the one thing that you say that you don't want, and that's love.",
        "Joshua: Wow. You're not only beautiful, but you're incredibly perceptive. Bristol, as a matter of fact.",
        "Alison: Well. the truth finally surfaces. Was that so painful?",
        "Joshua: More than you'll ever know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Sorry, Jamal. But I did warn you.",
        "[Jamal groans]",
        "Lisa: Oh, my God. Jamal, are you all right? What happened?",
        "Jamal: I'm fine, I'm fine. I just -- I just got jacked, that's all. I'm fine.",
        "Lisa: Listen, I'm a nurse. Let me help you.",
        "Jamal: No, no, I'm fine. I'm ok.",
        "Lisa: You got knocked out. I'm trying to get you to G.H. --",
        "Jamal: Look, I am fine! Ok, look, it's ok, all right? I'm fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: Kevin?",
        "Kevin: What do you want?",
        "[Karen sighs]",
        "Karen: Look, I know you think I'm being tough on you, but that's the kind of help you need.",
        "Kevin: Tough love, huh?",
        "Karen: Well, call it what you want. That's what you need.",
        "Kevin: You know, Karen, I haven't exactly been lovable lately. So what does that make you, a sucker for lost causes?",
        "Karen: I have a program that I think you will do well in. Are you willing to give it a try?",
        "Chris: Hey. I set you all up. I left the blood in your locker.",
        "Ian: Thanks, I owe you a big one.",
        "Chris: Yeah. Just take care of yourself. Keep me apprised, ok?",
