        "Eve: I'm pregnant. And that's why I ran away. I couldn't tell you before \r\nbecause Arianna was so sick and everything that you were going through, you had \r\nso much on your plate. I just didn't want to add anything more for you to think \r\nabout. But now you're here and it's true. We're going to have a baby, Thornhart. \r\nYou and me. We're going to have a baby.

        "Alison: Ok, well, then we'll just try and get Jamal, ok? ",
        "Livvie: No, you try. I have to get out there. Jack could be hurt. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, no! I'm sure he's fine, ok? It was probably just static or \r\nsomething. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you can stand around and wait to find out, but I'm not. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, Jamal told us to stay here. It was dangerous, he said. ",
        "Livvie: I don't care! ",
        "Alison: Look, this guy just pulled a gun on all of us. They are not playing \r\naround! ",

        "Ian: Arianna's fine. She's going to be great. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Karen came through as a liver donor. ",
        "Eve: She had the transplant? ",
        "Ian: Yes. And it was a near-perfect match. Couldn't have gone any better. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. That's incredible. Oh, that's incredible. But what about -- \r\nI mean, does she know where you are? ",
        "Ian: Yes, yeah -- no, she told me to come find you. ",
        "Eve: She did? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. She wants to start a new life, her own life, for the first time. \r\nAnd as soon as she gets on her feet, we're going to set her up -- new job in a \r\nsafe town, safe place, beautiful place. She's going to love it. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. So Arianna's really going to be ok. She's going to be ok.\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah. This is something, isn't it? This -- this is something. Divine \r\nintervention -- me finding you here. ",

        "Ian: No. ",
        "Eve: Why not? ",
        "Ian: Because I heard a voice, a very determined voice. It told me not to give \r\nup, and I'm glad I listened. ",
        "Eve: Well, that doesn't explain why you're here. ",
        "Ian: No, I know, but I -- I -- I started walking, and I kept walking because \r\nI knew if I did, I would find you. ",

        "Eve: Wow. ",

        "Ian: I'm sorry I put us through this. ",
        "Eve: No, no, no, no. I shouldn't have left. ",
        "Ian: But that's all behind us now because we're -- we're together -- and \r\nwe're -- we're having a baby. ",
