        "Lucy: Ian, it's me again. I've left you 50 messages. Could you just please \r\ncall me back as soon as you get this? I'm sort of really worried. You know, I \r\nwant to make sure you got out of that spooky place. I did have a very strange \r\nfeeling there, like you did -- you know, major vibes, and I just want to make \r\nsure that some stranger didn't get you because you picked up that Stranger card, \r\nok? So please, call me, ok? I'm worried. Ta. Oh! Donald, darling. Thank you so \r\nmuch for coming all the way over with these things. ",
        "Don: Sign where it's flagged, and I'll have them off to New York before the \r\nink dries. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Thank you. This is just so great of you. Listen, Donald, \r\ndarling, have you given any thought to what we discussed earlier? ",
        "Don: Yes. Regis definitely looks better in navy than in maroon. ",
        "Lucy: No, that's not what I'm talking about. You know, the other little thing \r\n-- ",
        "Don: Yes, and the answer is still no. ",
        "Lucy: I need a dresser for the Nurses' Ball! ",
        "Don: You need an army of them, and this year I refuse to be drafted. ",
        "Lucy: You're no longer a darling. What am I supposed to do? ",
        "Don: Find another darling. ",
        "Lucy: Ugh! Oh! Colleen, darling! How are you? ",
        "Colleen: Hi, Lucy. If you don't mind, I've got to go do something. ",
        "Lucy: \"Something?\" What is the something you're doing for the Nurses' \r\nBall?\r\n",
        "Colleen: Well, a few of us are putting together a little routine. ",
        "Lucy: Really? How sweet. But wouldn't you like to do something bigger, \r\nbetter? ",
        "Colleen: I can't be your dresser. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Colleen, come on. It's crucial to the ball, and the show would not \r\ngo on without you. ",
        "Colleen: No offense, Lucy, but I would rather be on bedpan duty. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Ew! Your number's going to be tacky anyway, you know. I just thought she'd \r\njump at the chance. ",
        "[Don laughs] ",
        "Lucy: Shut up. What am I supposed to do now? Doc! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I didn't know you were still here. ",
        "Lucy: Darling. I've -- I've been waiting for you. Listen -- how would you \r\nlike to undress me? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Eve. ",
        "Eve: Ian. I was wondering where you were. ",
        "Ian: Well, the doors of the chapel were locked or jammed or something, so I \r\ncouldn't get back in, but I found Michael, and he says his goodbyes. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Was he just amazed at how we found each other? ",
        "Ian: He's a priest. He believes in miracles -- ",
        "Eve: Gosh -- ",
        "Ian: As do I. ",
        "Eve: Just think -- we almost missed each other again. I was just about to \r\nleave. Thank goodness I came back for the cradle. It's like there was something \r\nkeeping me here, and now I know what it was. It was you. ",
        "Ian: Is that right? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Let's get out of here. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Oh, my God, Jack. No. ",
        "Jamal: All right -- all right, come on, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: No, I'm not leaving him! I'm not going! ",
        "Jamal: There's nothing else you can do. He's gone. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, Jamal's right. You can't stay here. ",
        "Livvie: No -- ",
        "Jamal: Come on, Livvie. Come on, we'll take care of him, ok? Come on. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, you already took care of him. Where were you? ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Livvie: Why were you so late? Why did Jack have to ride for you? ",
        "Jamal: Look, Livvie, it was a mistake. ",
        "Alison: No. It was my fault. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yours? ",
        "Alison: I didn't want Jamal riding. So he went out and I threw away his keys.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Livvie -- Livvie, Ali didn't have any idea anything like this would \r\nhappen. ",
        "Alison: I was just scared, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: So you protected the man you love. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. And now the man I love is dead. Are you happy now? Are you? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: My next appointment's not for a half-hour. Let's go. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, wait, wait -- Doc, I didn't mean just like right this minute, like \r\nright now. Wait -- just wait, wait. Don, didn't you mention something about the \r\nink can't dry on those papers, they need to get out? ",
        "Don: I'll handle it right away. ",
        "Lucy: Good, I suggest you do. Otherwise, you're going to be doing what you \r\ndon't want to do whether you like it or not. Bye! Where were we? ",
        "Kevin: Well, I thought we were going to undress you. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Do you know you are very, very good at that? ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's, like, a God-given talent you have -- you know, with all those \r\nlittle hooks and those little buttons, those little eyes and snaps. You turn it \r\ninto an art form. ",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe you just inspire me. ",
        "Lucy: Well, maybe you should share your talent with the entire world. ",
        "Kevin: You want me to undress other women? ",
        "Lucy: No! Heck, no. Just -- just me. ",
        "Kevin: Well, how would I share undressing you with the world? ",
        "Lucy: Well, think of it as kind of like a behind-the-scenes aspect. ",
        "Kevin: This wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that you can't find a \r\ndresser for the Nurses' Ball, would it? ",
        "Lucy: How'd you guess? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, everyone's avoiding you like the XFL -- or haven't you noticed?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Well -- well, you're not avoiding me. ",
        "Kevin: That's because I'm not going to be your dresser. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, you have to be because you're so eminently talented. ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, then, fine. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to have \r\nthat gorgeous hunky new intern on the fifth floor, Wayne, undress me. He's dying \r\nto rip my clothes off. ",
        "Kevin: Won't work. ",
        "Lucy: You know, he looks like Brad Pitt. I love Brad Pitt. I just want to \r\nmunch on Brad Pitt. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Isn't he the same one who's dating the nurse who looks just like \r\nJennifer Aniston? ",
        "Lucy: What am I supposed to do, then? I need a dresser, Doc. What am I \r\nsupposed to do? I could do it myself, I guess, but -- ",
        "Kevin: Hey, why didn't I think of that? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. Twenty gowns I'm going to change myself? ",
        "Kevin: Well, here's a thought -- why don't you just try wearing 10? Or better \r\nyet, why don't you wear the same dress all night long? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! I can't do that. It's tradition, you know? I have to look fabulous. \r\nMy public expects it. ",
        "Kevin: \"My public expects it.\" Lucy, you look great in a candy striper \r\nuniform. ",
        "Lucy: Shh, shh. ",
        "Kevin: I should know. ",
        "Lucy: You're not supposed to bring that up again. Well, thank you very much \r\nfor all your support. Now what am I supposed to do? This year is not going very \r\nwell. It seems that no one even cares. This is the biggest fundraiser of the \r\nyear, the Nurses' Ball, and no one cares. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, that's not true. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, it is true. You don't want to be my dresser and Colleen's making \r\nbedpan jokes and Don hightailed it out of here and, you know, Livvie and Alison, \r\nthose ridiculous girls -- they didn't even show up for the last rehearsal of \r\ntheir big number, and Eve -- I don't know where the heck she is. She's left town \r\nlike she doesn't even care, and now I can't even find Ian. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I wouldn't count on Ian being your dresser. ",
        "Lucy: Well, no, I'm not looking for him about that. I'm just kind of worried \r\nabout him. ",
        "Kevin: Why? ",
        "Lucy: I think maybe Ian's in trouble. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I can't believe we're back here again -- together, this time. ",
        "Ian: For all time. ",
        "Eve: I missed you so much. I would dream about you every night, what it felt \r\nlike to have you lying next to me. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: Every time I closed my eyes, I'd see your face. ",
        "Ian: I never stopped wanting you. ",
        "Eve: I thought I'd never see you again. ",
        "Ian: I'm not going to let that happen. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "Ian: Not this time. ",
        "Eve: And here we are again, back where it all started. We did it right this \r\ntime, Ian. We got it right this time. ",
        "Ian: Thank God for that. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: What happened to Jack was -- was an accident. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but it didn't happen to you, did it? Because Alison made sure \r\nof that. ",
        "Alison: Livvie -- Livvie, I didn't know that Jack would ride for Jamal, ok? \r\nYou guys weren't even supposed to be here. ",
        "Livvie: Because Jamal dumped him as his mechanic. You were both ticked off at \r\nhim. ",
        "Alison: No, no, that is not true. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Alison, you never even liked him in the first place! ",
        "Alison: Maybe not in the beginning, but, I mean, that was a long time ago.\r\n",
        "Livvie: After everything he's done for you. He bailed you guys out so many \r\ntimes with your grandmother and the stupid bike shop and Zach, and this is how \r\nyou pay him back? ",
        "Alison: That is not fair! ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God -- Jack is dead because of you. ",
        "Alison: I would never do this on purpose, and you know that. ",
        "Livvie: No. All I know is that he's gone. And I am never going to be able to \r\nbe with him again -- to hold him and tell him how much I love him. He was just \r\ngetting his life together, and he was happy for the first time ever. And now --\r\n",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, I'm sorry -- ",
        "Livvie: No! Don't bother, ok? Because I don't want to hear it. I don't want \r\nto hear how sorry you and everybody are because -- ",
        "Jamal: All right, that's it. That's it! That's enough. You want to blame \r\nsomebody? You're looking at him. Ok, Alison -- she didn't do this to Jack. I \r\ndid. But I'm going to make this right. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Oh. You really put your heart and soul into this place, didn't you, \r\nMichael? ",
        "Caleb: But, you know, it still looks like it could use a little help. I mean, \r\nafter all, what are brothers for? ",
        "",
        "Eve: I'm not finished yet. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: Hey. Promise me something. ",
        "Ian: Anything. ",
        "Eve: Promise me that you will never let me go. ",
        "Ian: Oh, I promise. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, I tried to catch up to him, but one of Zach's buddies just cut \r\nme off. ",
        "Alison: We tried to warn him when you radioed us. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, Zach was just too fast and just chased him over the cliff. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, we need to call the police and tell them what you saw. ",
        "Jamal: Well, Zach's telling them a different story. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: He's setting me up, Ali. ",
        "Alison: But we can prove that you didn't do anything. You were on the \r\nheadsets with us. ",
        "Jamal: The cops never believed us before. Why are they going to start now?\r\n",
        "Alison: Because it's your word against Zach's. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and his buddies. ",
        "Alison: But that doesn't matter. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, Ali -- listen to me, listen to me. Ok, I bagged the race. Ok, I \r\nlet Jack ride for me, and that was right after I got into a fight with him in \r\nfront of Garcia and that baby-face detective. Ali, they saw the whole thing, and \r\nZach knows it. So he was there, remember? ",
        "Alison: So? ",
        "Jamal: I got the record, I got the reason, I look guilty as hell. ",
        "Alison: But you didn't do anything. You didn't kill Jack. ",
        "Jamal: Well, Ali, I didn't really exactly stop it from happening, either. ",
        "Alison: So what are you saying, then? That you should go to jail? ",
        "Jamal: Somebody's got to. ",
        "Livvie: No. Jack wouldn't want that. You were his friend. But I swear to God, \r\nI am not going to let Zach get away with this. ",
        "Alison: We're not, either. ",
        "Jamal: Cops are not going to let this go. They're going to ask all sorts of \r\nquestions about what happened to Jack. ",
        "Livvie: Not if they don't know he's dead.",
        "",
        "Lucy: So, Serena and I kind of bumped into Ian, I guess, in the woods. Well, \r\nactually, Ian sort of bumped into us, and that's when the Stranger card sort of \r\nfell out of my purse. ",
        "Kevin: The Stranger card? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You know, the card that kept coming up from my tarot deck in the \r\nhospital? Remember that day? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, I remember. It just happened to fall out of your purse? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I guess my purse just sort of open when I was hitting Ian with \r\nit. ",
        "Kevin: You hit Ian with your purse? ",
        "Lucy: Are you going to let me finish my story or not? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, please, finish your story. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. So anyway, I was defending myself, basically, with my purse, \r\nand that's when the card practically flew out and landed right -- well, not \r\nreally in his hands, but he practically had it in his hands. ",
        "Kevin: So? ",
        "Lucy: \"So?\" Doc, don't you see what this means? This means a stranger is \r\ncoming into Ian's life. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you have a lot on your plate right now. You have the Nurses' \r\nBall, you have to find a dresser. That's an impossible task anyway, so why don't \r\nyou just forget about Ian just for now? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I -- I'm not sure. I just can't stop thinking about Ian. You know, \r\nthis time of year -- well, last year around the Nurses' Ball is when I met him. \r\nIt was right after I found out about Christina. And, you know, Ian was the only \r\none that could really get through to me, you know? He started me down the road \r\nto recovery, I guess. I mean, you did, too, but he's the one that allowed me to \r\nopen up to you. ",
        "Kevin: And I'll always owe him for that. ",
        "Lucy: Well, now I think it's my turn. It's my turn now to help him, and I \r\njust can't figure out how if I can't find him. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I can see you're worried, but you know Ian. He tends to land on \r\nhis feet. I wouldn't worry about him. I'm sure he's fine. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, I would just feel a lot better if I could just find him. \r\nOh, Ian, where are you? ",
        "",
        "Eve: So you finally decided to give yourself a break and admit that you've \r\ndone so many wonderful things for people. ",
        "Ian: I finally decided to forgive myself for all the things I didn't do. But \r\nI never imagined this in my wildest dreams. When I was a little boy growing up \r\nin Ireland, my sister, Granya, and my brother, Patrick, and myself -- we'd sneak \r\nout some nights and go up on top of this hill. We'd lay on our backs. We'd look \r\nat the stars. On a clear night, you could see a million of them. And Granya \r\nwould say that every star is a person that once loved on this earth. Some nights \r\nwe'd see one fall, and she'd say, \"There goes one, looking to find his true \r\ncompanion.\" And I told her, \"With a sky as big as this and the world as big as \r\nit is, to find your true love -- well, that's impossible.\" She'd smile and she'd \r\nsay, \"Well, if anyone can do it, it'll be you.\" And she was right. ",
        "Eve: I wish she could see how happy you are. ",
        "Ian: Oh, she can. I know she can. Granya, I'm going to be a da! ",
        "Eve: Oh! Granya, he's going to be a wonderful da! ",
        "Ian: You all right? You cold? ",
        "Eve: A little bit. These darned pregnancy hormones -- I'm cold one minute, \r\nI'm hot the next. What's this? ",
        "Ian: Oh. That's one of Lucy's tarot cards. I met her in the woods. ",
        "Eve: What? What was Lucy doing all the way out here? ",
        "Ian: She was having a picnic with Serena. I don't_-- ",
        "Eve: Oh. Well, what does this mean? ",
        "Ian: It's the Stranger card, and she says it's a bad omen. She says someone's \r\ngoing to come and stir things up. ",
        "Eve: Hmm. Well, I guess maybe she was half right because Michael was a \r\nstranger. But he's the reason we're back together, so that can't be bad. ",
        "Ian: No. Not at all. ",
        "",
        "Michael: Why, Caleb? Why? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: We better get out of here before that farmer sees what we did to his \r\nfence. ",
        "Livvie: I don't know how to say goodbye, Jack, because -- I -- I can't \r\nimagine my life without you. I -- I can't see it, maybe because you'll always be \r\nwith me in my thoughts and in my heart. And the people that did this to you -- I \r\nam going to make them pay, Jack. I am going to make them hurt the way I do right \r\nnow. They took away the best thing that has ever happened to me. ",
        "Livvie: You were my first love, Jack, and you will be my last. ",
        "Alison: Livvie -- Livvie, it's time. ",

        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" -- ",
        "Ian: Who would do something like this, desecrate a church like this? ",
        "Michael: He's my brother. ",
        "Lucy: It's -- it's Christina. ",
        "Officer: And what's that? You've got blood on you. "
