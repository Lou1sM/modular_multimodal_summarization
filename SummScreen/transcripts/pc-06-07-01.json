        "Ian: Someone let him out? And let him out of where? ",
        "Michael: He was in the cellar. ",
        "Ian: He was what? ",
        "Michael: I know how that must sound. But you must understand, my -- my \r\nbrother's not well. ",
        "Ian: Do you want to elaborate on that? You got two doctors here. ",
        "Michael: Caleb's aggressive. He loses control easily. As a result, he's a \r\ndanger to himself and others. He's violent. I was lucky enough to be able to \r\nmaneuver him downstairs but somehow he was able to get out. ",
        "Eve: I did it, Michael. I opened the cellar. ",
        "Michael: You saw Caleb? ",
        "Eve: No! I didn't see anything or anyone. I didn't even know anyone was down \r\nthere. ",
        "Michael: This is -- this is not good, not -- not at all. ",
        "Eve: Michael? ",
        "Michael: Not at all. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I still can't get over her little face. She's 2 years old. My baby's 2. \r\nShe -- she's got beautiful hair, doesn't she? It's gotten so much longer. And \r\nlook -- every single one of her little teeth are in. ",
        "Kevin: She is beautiful. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Julie's doing it, isn't she? She's keeping her promise. She's \r\ntaking very good care of her. I can tell. Look at that smile. Christina's very \r\nhealthy and she's genuinely happy. ",
        "Kevin: You know, for years, I've heard parents say that the only thing that \r\nmattered to them was knowing that their kids were happy. I guess I never really \r\nunderstood. ",
        "Lucy: And now? ",
        "Kevin: Looking at you, looking at Christina, makes all the sense in the \r\nworld. And I know you want to be with her. You've -- you've done everything you \r\ncan to be with her, and you still would. But somehow knowing that she's healthy \r\nand she's happy gives you a sense of peace somehow. ",
        "Lucy: I know. It sounds so weird, but it -- it's true. You're absolutely \r\nright. It's kind of funny, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Not to me, not at all. Now that I have a daughter of my own, it makes \r\nperfect sense. I think the worst thing for me was if Livvie was in pain or hurt, \r\nand I didn't know about it. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: All right, look, we're all feeling what we're feeling. Ok? It's not \r\ngoing anywhere. ",
        "Livvie: Jack's dead. We buried him, and nobody can know. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but we got to talk about it, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: No, there's nothing to say. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, well, maybe not now, but when there is, we got each other. Ok, \r\nremember that. And if there's nothing to say, there's plenty to do, so let's get \r\nstarted. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, can we please take just a few minutes? ",
        "Jamal: No, Spunky. We don't have them, ok? We got to get to work on nailing \r\nZach for what he did to Jack. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Jamal: It's Chris. ",
        "Alison: Chris? Jack's brother Chris? What do we tell him? ",
        "[Knocking] ",
        "Alison: What do we do? ",
        "Jamal: Nothing, nothing, nothing. We get rid of him, ok? That's it. ",
        "Alison: Wait, wait, wait! Your shirt, your shirt, your shirt. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, my shirt. ",
        "Alison: Ahem. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, can I help you? ",
        "Chris: Hey, how's it going? Look, I really need to come -- ",
        "Jamal: Hey, you know what? We're closed. Do me a favor -- can you come back \r\ntomorrow, ok? ",
        "Chris: No, no -- no, actually, it's not ok. I'm not here about a bike. I need \r\nto see my brother. ",
        "Jamal: Your brother? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, my brother -- Jack. Where's Jack? ",
        "",
        "Chris: You going to stand there or are you going to tell him I'm here? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I can't tell him anything. Jack's not around. ",
        "Chris: Where is he? ",
        "Jamal: He's gone. ",
        "Chris: Gone? What do you mean, gone? Where'd he go? ",
        "Livvie: What do you care? What do you want him for all of a sudden? ",
        "Chris: Nice to see you, too, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: What's this about, Chris? ",
        "Chris: I don't need a reason to see my own brother. We're family. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, now you're family? Well, where the hell have you been for the \r\npast six months, Mr. Family? Where was Jack's family when he first came into \r\ntown and he had to live in a shack by the river, huh? ",
        "Chris: Just slow down. ",
        "Livvie: You didn't care about family when you were trying to get me into bed, \r\ndid you? When you did everything you could to keep us apart, when you wasted the \r\ntime we could've been spending together. ",
        "Chris: Would you take it easy? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, take a hike, Chris. Jack's gone, ok? He left and he's not coming \r\nback, so you can take your little family routine and shove it because the only \r\nreal family Jack ever had is standing right here telling you you're too late. \r\nYou're too damn late. ",
        "Alison: Livvie -- Livvie -- ",
        "[door closes] ",
        "Chris: What was that all about? ",
        "Alison: About what a creep you are -- that's what it was about. ",
        "Chris: Anybody want to tell me what's going on around here? ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa. We already told you everything you need to know, ok? ",
        "Chris: Whoa. ",
        "Jamal: No, don't start with me. We're closed. ",
        "Chris: No, no, listen to me. I don't know what's going on, but I'm not \r\nleaving until you tell me where I can find my little brother. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Why didn't you ever tell me about your brother? ",
        "Michael: I thought he'd got control of his temper. I -- ",
        "Ian: What set him off? ",
        "Michael: Please. Let me start by saying I -- I love my brother very much and \r\nI only want what's best for him. He had come for a visit. Things started off the \r\nway they always do -- we were happy to see one another. We were having a good \r\ntime. And then Caleb -- he just gets angry, and when he does, he explodes. I was \r\npraying for him here in the chapel when he came up behind me and he vowed to \r\ndestroy the monastery. Of course, I couldn't let him do that. So -- ",
        "Eve: So you locked him up. And I let him out. ",
        "Ian: And he made good on his promise. ",
        "Eve: Michael, I think maybe your brother needs professional help. ",
        "Michael: Oh, Eve, I've -- I've tried many times. It's only made him worse.\r\n",
        "Ian: If he can do this to a church, who knows what else he's capable of?",
        "Eve: Ian's right. You know, maybe we should just go ahead and call the police \r\nand let them -- ",
        "Michael: No. No police -- not ever. ",
        "",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Alison: Livvie? Livvie, it's me. Let me in, ok? ",
        "Livvie: Go away. ",
        "Alison: Livvie? Livvie, Jack was my friend, too. And you're the best friend \r\nI've got and I just want to help you if I can. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you can't. Ok? No one can. ",
        "Alison: You won't even let me try? ",
        "Livvie: Go away, Alison. No one can help. No one. ",
        "Alison: No one, huh? ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Oh, Jack. This isn't happening. Oh, God, please. Tell me this \r\nisn't happening. ",
        "",
        "Michael: I'm sorry I overreacted when you mentioned the authorities, but, \r\nwell, there was a time when they were involved and they treated him terribly.\r\n",
        "Ian: He needs some help. You know that. ",
        "Michael: I should try again. It's just I -- I worry about how much pain Caleb \r\nmust be in. ",
        "Eve: I am worried about you. He could really hurt you. ",
        "Michael: Oh -- he can't hurt me -- well, not physically anyway. Instead, he \r\ncuts deeper. He attacks my faith, goes after it, pushes it to the limits every \r\ntime. ",
        "Ian: And he does this -- ",
        "Michael: He does it because I'm the only one that has any power over him, \r\nIan. You see, I'm the only one that can reach Caleb. And I will, I promise. ",
        "Eve: You were very protective of him. ",
        "Michael: Oh. Eve, it's more instinctual than anything. I -- you see, Caleb \r\nand I, we're not just brothers -- we're twins, which creates a bond that someone \r\nwho isn't a twin wouldn't understand. I feel -- I feel compelled to help him. \r\nHe's the reason why I became a priest. ",
        "Ian: Why, so you can save him? ",
        "Michael: To balance out him being who he is, I -- I felt I had to dedicate \r\nmyself to doing some good in the world. ",
        "Ian: And you think you can control a man like that, by yourself, forever? ",
        "Michael: I have for all these years. And something tells me I'll go right on \r\ndoing it until the day I die. ",
        "",
        "Chris: I'm already an expert on stonewalling, so -- ",
        "Chris: We both know there's something you're not telling me, Jamal. And I'm \r\nnot leaving without an answer. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? I cannot give you what I don't have. ",
        "Chris: No, I think you can. You see, whatever problems Jack and I have had, \r\nwe're still brothers. Nothing changes that. I'm not here to give him any \r\ntrouble. I just want to talk with him -- or give him some help if there's \r\ntrouble. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? You're pulling stuff out of the air now, ok? No one \r\neven said anything about trouble. ",
        "Chris: So he just woke up, packed up, and left -- no reasons, no forwarding \r\naddress? Nothing, just like that? ",
        "Jamal: Yep. Yep, just like that. ",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. I don't believe you. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you know what? That's your business, ok? And as far as that \r\nbrothers bull, Livvie told you everything you needed to know about that. Ok? Why \r\nshould we tell you a damn thing? ",
        "Chris: Because I can help him if he needs it. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, he doesn't. You're too late. ",
        "Chris: Too late? What the hell does that mean? ",
        "Jamal: Yo, it means what it means! Ok? Jack is gone! But it's like we said. \r\nOk? It's too late for that brotherly love. Ok? You should've thought about that \r\nwhen he was around. But he left. And all you're doing is wasting your time and \r\nmine. Get out. Now. ",
        "Chris: Ok, Jamal, do you even know where he is? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Alison? ",
        "Alison: Kevin. The hospital said that you'd be here. ",
        "Lucy: Well, well, well, well. If it isn't Ms. Barrington. You know, you and \r\nLivvie missed your big Nurses Ball rehearsal, and why are you so dirty? ",
        "Alison: Uh, Jamal and I went out for a ride. Look, Kevin, I wouldn't bother \r\nyou if it weren't important. ",
        "Kevin: You're not bothering me. Come on in. Have a seat and tell me what I \r\ncan do for you. ",
        "Alison: It's not me. I'm not the one. ",
        "Lucy: What -- what do you mean you're not \"the one?\" ",
        "Alison: I'm not the one who -- look, I know that Jack has never been your \r\nfavorite person -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Jack, what -- what about Jack? Something \r\nhappened to Jack, didn't it? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Uh, Jack is -- Jack is gone. ",
        "Kevin: He's gone? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and he's not coming back. Livvie's upset. She's really bad. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Back up. You're telling me he just took \r\noff without any explanation? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Nobody expected it to happen. ",
        "Lucy: That does not make any sense. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it makes sense -- oh, it sounds just like him. He drifts from \r\ntown to town with no concern for anyone. ",
        "Alison: Look, none of that matters now, ok? Who cares how he left or why or \r\nwhether or not he had a reason? Ok? I'm sorry, but Livvie is the only thing that \r\nmatters right now. Ok, she's locked herself inside of Jack's room and she won't \r\ntalk to me and Jamal. She needs somebody, Kevin. She needs her father. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- well, I can come as soon as I can. I'm just not sure this is the \r\nright time. ",
        "Lucy: No. Doc, it's the perfect -- perfect time. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I'm not sure I should leave you alone right now. ",
        "Lucy: You're not going to. I'm not going to be alone because I'm just going \r\nto come with you, that's all. ",
        "Kevin: Are you sure? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, positive. Doc, I lost my daughter. I don't have her with me now. \r\nBut you have a daughter, and she's in a lot of pain. You need to go. That's all \r\na parent needs to know. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: It's so cold in here. You know, I never minded with you close, but -- \r\nbut, Jack, where's your sweater? The one I always loved you in? The one I always \r\ntried to steal? The one that you had to tickle me until I couldn't breathe to \r\nfind it? God. Where is it? Where did it go? Oh, God. Oh, God, please don't do \r\nthis. Please don't do this. It's so unfair. And don't you dare tell me that life \r\nis unfair because life was wonderful, and I finally had someone to share it with \r\nand -- and they took that away. They took that away -- Zach and Sam and his pack \r\nof -- oh. Oh, here it is. ",
        "Livvie: I want them to feel the way I'm feeling and hurt the way I hurt. \r\nAlison and Jamal can plan whatever they want to plan, but I am not waiting. ",

No, no. Please, don't tell him about me calling him -- \r\nan old friend and I just want to walk in out of nowhere and surprise him, ok?\r\n",

        "Eve: But I really feel weird leaving you here alone to handle all this by \r\nyourself. ",
        "Michael: I've been doing it for a long time. Besides, you two have a family \r\nof your own to worry about now. ",
