        "Alison: I can't believe we just buried our best friend and nobody knows. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. I know. ",
        "Alison: None of this would have happened if it weren't for me, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Ali -- ",
        "Alison: Jamal, I threw your keys. Jack raced because of me. He is dead \r\nbecause of me. ",
        "Jamal: Stop. You didn't do this to Jack, ok? You hear me? Zach did. Ok, \r\nZach's the one that chased him off the road. Zach's the one to blame, baby, not \r\nyou, ok? And Zach's the one that's going to pay for this. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, as much as I want to get Zach for what he did, it's not going \r\nto bring Jack back to us. It's not. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know. I know, I know. ",
        "Alison: And Livvie -- oh. I feel so awful for Livvie. I don't know what to do \r\nfor her. ",
        "Jamal: Sweetie, you are doing all you can by just being a good friend to her.\r\n",
        "Alison: She needs more. That's why I asked Kevin and Lucy to stop by, check \r\non her. ",
        "Jamal: You what? ",
        "Alison: Jamal -- ",
        "Jamal: Ali -- ",
        "Alison: Jamal, Livvie needs her dad. Ok? She's so crushed and so angry. I'm \r\nreally afraid of what she might do. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: What are you doing here? And how long have you -- ",
        "Lucy: Hey, we just -- we just walked in the door. ",
        "Kevin: Just got here. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Um, well, listen, now is not really a good time. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, are you ok? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'm fine. ",
        "Lucy: You know, you don't look ok. You seem a little agitated and, what, are \r\nyou in a hurry to go somewhere? ",
        "Kevin: You going away? What? ",
        "Livvie: No. I'm actually late for an appointment, so I'll call you guys \r\nlater, ok? ",
        "Kevin: No, Livvie? Livvie, you don't have to hide it from us. ",
        "Lucy: We know about Jack. ",
        "Kevin: You want to tell us what happened? ",
        "",
        "Eve: I can't believe it. We're really going home to Port Charles to start a \r\nnew life and a family. ",
        "Ian: Believe it. Dreams come true. ",
        "Eve: They certainly do. ",
        "[Ian honks horn] ",
        "Eve: What are you doing? What are you doing? ",
        "Ian: I'm letting the world know how happy I am. If I had any musical talent, \r\nI'd play an Irish jig on it. ",
        "Eve: No, no, no, please don't. They're going to think it's road rage. Stop \r\nit. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Come over here, baby. For the first time since we met, we have nothing \r\nhanging over us, nothing at all. ",
        "Eve: It's a miracle, isn't it, to have no worries? ",
        "Ian: It's a miracle indeed. ",
        "",
        "Michael: Please keep everyone safe from my brother, wherever he is. Don't let \r\nhim harm anyone. I beg of you, don't let him harm anyone. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Who told you about Jack? ",
        "Kevin: Alison did. ",
        "Livvie: Alison? Why would she say anything? ",
        "Kevin: I guess she's just worried about you. ",
        "Lucy: She's worried sick because she knows you're taking Jack leaving town \r\nreally hard. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. It's really hard. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, you don't have to go through this alone. I want to be there \r\nfor you. I want to be able to help you any way we can get through it. I love \r\nyou, Livvie. If I could reach in there and just take the pain out, I would. ",
        "Livvie: It just hurts, Dad. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know. ",
        "Livvie: I just miss him so much. ",
        "Kevin: I know. I'm so sorry, honey. ",
        "Livvie: It's just not fair, you know? ",
        "Kevin: No, it's not. Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, um, I got to go. I'm going to be late. ",
        "Kevin: Well, can't it wait, whatever it is? ",
        "Livvie: Um -- no. We'll -- we'll talk later, ok? I promise. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Thanks for coming. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Doc, listen to me. Something isn't right. ",
        "Kevin: I'll say something isn't right -- my daughter's devastated because \r\nthat jerk bailed on her. I wish he was right here in this room right now -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no, no. ",
        "Kevin: I could throw him out that window! ",
        "Lucy: Stop -- listen to me. It's not that -- it's Livvie. You know how \r\nsometimes when she gets hurt by someone or betrayed by someone, you know what \r\nshe does. She gets angry and she shuts down. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what are you trying to say? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, she was wearing Jack's sweater. I recognized it. And those tears, \r\nthat pain she's feeling -- there's something else to it. I can't explain it, but \r\nthere's something else to it. ",
        "Kevin: She believed in a guy who obviously didn't give a damn about her. \r\nIsn't that enough? ",
        "Lucy: No, I think -- I think something did happen to Jack, but something \r\nworse. Something much, much worse. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Hi, I called earlier. Is Zach Vernon still there? Well, is he coming \r\nback soon? You don't expect him in tonight -- great. No. No message. I'm going \r\nto find you, Zach, and when I do, I am going to kill you for what you did to \r\nJack. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Well, there are a few more things to worry about. ",
        "Eve: Like what? ",
        "Ian: Like who's going to change the diapers and the midnight feeding and \r\nthat. ",
        "Eve: Uh-huh. That's very funny. ",
        "Ian: Well, you know how I like to sleep. ",
        "Eve: Ok. So I'm in charge of the diaper changing and the midnight feedings --\r\n",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: And all the mommy stuff? ",
        "Ian: Right. And I'll take care of the daddy stuff. ",
        "Eve: Such as? ",
        "Ian: Well, I'll teach the boy how to fight properly and to pour a beer \r\nwithout spilling anything. ",
        "Eve: And what if he is a she? ",
        "Ian: I don't care if it's a boy or a girl. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my gosh. What if we're having twins? ",
        "Ian: Aye. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Twins. ",
        "Ian: You thinking of Michael and his brother, aren't you? ",
        "Eve: Oh, Ian, I don't know if it was such a good idea for us to leave him \r\nalone at the monastery looking for Caleb. ",
        "Ian: Well, he told you he didn't want us to help. It's family business. I \r\nunderstand it. ",
        "Eve: Well, maybe. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Eve: Well, Michael is a priest. He has devoted his life to God. And he is \r\nrefurbishing this beautiful monastery. And all of a sudden, his brother comes in \r\nand just trashes the whole place. That's not just some family disagreement. \r\nThat's pure evil. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Oh. Finally, you're back! God, I was about to come looking for you.\r\n",
        "Jamal: There was a long line at this fast-food joint, baby. ",
        "Alison: Well, you should've called! ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong with you? ",
        "Alison: I was scared! That's what. You just -- you said that you were going \r\nto be gone for a few minutes and then you -- you didn't come back and it was \r\ngetting later. ",
        "Jamal: I'm here, I'm here. ",
        "Alison: Later. ",
        "Jamal: Ok? I'm fine. Look, I won't leave you alone again, all right, baby?\r\n",
        "Alison: Jamal -- Jamal, it's not I'm afraid for me, ok? I'm afraid for you.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Hey, Zach has got no reason to come after me. Ok? I'm his fall guy, \r\nremember? Without me, he has nobody to pin Jack's death on. ",
        "Alison: It's not just Zach, ok? It's everything. Anything can happen to you \r\nout there. You know, look at Jack -- prime example. Sitting here in the shop, \r\nlaughing, having a good old time one minute. And the next minute, you know --\r\n",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I miss him, too. ",
        "Alison: I just miss him. And Livvie -- God. I feel so awful for Livvie. But \r\nI'm feeling even more awful for what I'm feeling. ",
        "Jamal: What's that? ",
        "Alison: I'm glad that it wasn't you. Oh, God, please forgive me. I'm sorry, \r\nbut I'm so glad that it wasn't you on that bike. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: God, Jamal, you know? I feel like the most wretched, awful, selfish \r\nperson in the whole entire face of this earth. But I can't lose you. I couldn't. \r\nI couldn't lose you. ",
        "Jamal: I know, baby. I can't lose you, either. ",
        "Alison: Promise me that you will be careful. Look, I know -- I know that \r\nyou're not afraid of Zach, ok? But, Jamal, he is still a dangerous person. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you don't have to worry about anything, ok? I've set everything \r\nup to take him down. ",
        "Alison: You did? ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm. I got in contact with that Billy guy. ",
        "Alison: The one that was riding for him in that earlier race and got hurt? \r\nThe one in the wheelchair? ",
        "Jamal: Yep. ",
        "Alison: Is he willing to talk? ",
        "Jamal: Ali, he's in a wheelchair. Ok? He'll talk, ok, chapter and verse about \r\nall the scams that Zach pulled, all the people he's hurt, everything. Then we'll \r\njust go to the cops. ",
        "Alison: I just want all this stuff to be over with. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, me, too. I'm tired. Let's go home, all right? ",
        "Alison: It's Jack's blood. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, not now. ",
        "Lucy: \"Not now\" what? ",
        "Kevin: Whatever you're sensing, whatever the universe is trying to tell you, \r\nthis is a case of boy dumps girl. ",
        "Lucy: No. ",
        "Kevin: And the girl happens to be my daughter. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait. Jack cared about Livvie a great deal. In fact, he was head \r\nover heels for Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, you know what? He made me believe it for a minute, too.\r\n",
        "Lucy: No. You saw it, too. ",
        "Kevin: Like I said, he's a good liar. He's a typical Ramsey. ",
        "Lucy: Jack was in love with Livvie. Come on, you remember how hard he fought \r\nto get her back. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Probably so he could keep trying to use her to get back at \r\nChris. And then he got bored. That's what happened, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I don't think it is. It's just -- it just doesn't make sense. ",
        "Kevin: All right, fine. What makes sense? What's your theory? What else could \r\nit be? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Just bear with me for a minute, ok? You remember, with Serena, we \r\nwent into the woods, right? And we got kind of creeped out that it was really \r\nweird. And Ian chased us out, right? Remember we were scared and now, since that \r\nday, we haven't seen Ian. He sort of disappeared. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what do the woods have to do with it? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Livvie -- we had lunch, ok? And we were -- actually, we had a \r\nwonderful time. You know, we went shopping. Then we had this BLT, and -- ok. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok, I'm sorry. She told me they went to the woods, Jack and Livvie, \r\nand something very strange happened. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Why was it strange, and why didn't she tell me about it? ",
        "Lucy: Well, um, you're her dad. Maybe she just didn't want to worry you. ",
        "Kevin: Well, now I'm worried. ",
        "Lucy: No, it -- they were sort of camping, and Jack left for a minute to go \r\nget some firewood. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, you know what? Maybe I don't want to hear it. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you do. You need to hear this. He goes to get firewood, right? \r\nBut he doesn't come back. Don't you see? Livvie gets worried, she decides she'd \r\nbetter call Jamal and Alison. They come out to help her look for him, and they \r\nlook and look, and finally they find him. But he's facedown on the ground, \r\ncompletely confused and disoriented. ",
        "Kevin: So what? He got lost, he fell. What happened? ",
        "Lucy: That's just the point. He doesn't know. Jack doesn't even remember, and \r\nno one can figure it out. And Livvie told me that somehow -- after that, he's \r\nbeen a little bit strange -- like, off, you know? Like maybe sick or something.\r\n",
        "Kevin: And? ",
        "Lucy: I just think this has something to do with Jack not being here, \r\nleaving. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, come on. Doc, you've heard the stories about how people just all of \r\na sudden drive off in their car one day and nobody's found them again. And they \r\ndon't know who they are or why they're -- or even where they're from. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, except in those few stories, the people are usually over 80 years \r\nold. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, fine. Fine. I will give you that. I don't know what happened. Maybe \r\nit's not exactly like that. But I really do believe Jack did not leave of his \r\nown free will. ",
        "Kevin: Why can't you just admit that he's a selfish kid who didn't give a \r\ndamn about my daughter? ",
        "Lucy: Because, deep down, I don't believe that's what happened. And I don't \r\nthink Livvie is telling us everything. And I just wish I could find something to \r\nprove to you that I'm right. What? What? ",
        "Kevin: I think you may have just gotten your wish. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I miss you so much, Jack. I keep expecting to see you or -- or to \r\nhear your voice. I keep hoping I'm just going to wake up and this all would've \r\nbeen a really, really bad dream because I can't imagine my life without you. \r\nGod, I love you so much. And I am so sorry we have to lie about you, but I know \r\n-- I know you wouldn't want Jamal getting in any trouble. And I want Zach to pay \r\nfor what he's done to you. And I promise you, Jack, I promise you he will. But \r\nmore than anything, I just -- I wish you were here, holding me because I want to \r\nfeel close to you. And I do here. I do. I still feel you.

        "Eve: Oh. No, actually. I can't stop thinking about Michael. I know. I know. I \r\nknow. You're right. He said he didn't need our help. You know, there's nothing \r\nwe can do. ",
        "Ian: But? ",
        "Eve: But I can't help feeling sorry for the guy, you know? I mean, that's a \r\nlot of pressure to put on yourself -- to sacrifice your whole life to make up \r\nfor the sins of your brother. ",
        "Ian: Well, if there's one thing I learned the hard way, is that you can't \r\nsave the world, even one person, all by yourself. ",
