        "Unaware that Joshua is eavesdropping, Jamal fills Alison in on Rafe's drunken scene at the Elixir. He assures her that he's perfectly happy as a vampire, but he wonders whether she's ready to become one herself. Alison refuses to think that far ahead, preferring to take things one step at a time. She admits that Joshua has granted her requests and that he seems to want her to be happy. Jamal suggests that she could surprise herself and fall in love with Joshua, but Alison knows that her love for Rafe will last forever. Jamal promises never to abandon Alison, and after a chaste kiss, he leaves her to her thoughts. Joshua confronts him outside her room. Under threat of extreme torture and suffering for both of them, he orders Jamal never to touch Alison or give her false hope again. Stepping outside, Alison talks to her absent soul mate. As she wishes for his presence, the wind begins to blow. Meanwhile, Rafe returns to the barn, where he reminisces about the love he and Alison share. He doesn't understand how he could have been so wrong in his belief that nothing could come between them again. He decides not to return to the barn anytime soon because of the intense pain it causes him. Before leaving, he hears Alison's voice telling him \"goodbye\" and saying that she loves him. In the catacombs, Olivia waits anxiously for proof that her bite succeeded in returning Caleb to his former glory. When Caleb eventually opens his eyes, he is overjoyed to discover that he's himself again. He magically transports the two of them out of the catacombs to a more romantic place, where they make love. Caleb confesses his brief notion that he could learn to be happy as a mortal. Although Olivia believes that nothing can hurt them now that they're together, Caleb warns that they're still vulnerable, and he wants her to learn to use her strength and power. Caleb vows never to lose this life again."

        "Rafe's voice: I'm already the luckiest guy I know.",
        "Alison: Well, not as half as lucky as I am, because I'm right here with you in the place where all good dreams happen.",
        "Rafe: For now and for all time.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Oh, boy.",
        "Rafe's voice: I've never seen anything more beautiful in my life. I promise that we will be joined together as one, for now and into eternity.",
        "Alison: And I promise you, Rafe Kovich, to carry your love with me forever. My heart and soul now belongs to you from now through eternity.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Ahem. Hey, sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Alison: No. I didn't even hear you come in. Sorry.",
        "Jamal: No, it's cool. You looked like you were on another planet.",
        "Alison: No, just another lifetime.",
        "[Magazine drops]",
        "Jamal: I got it. Oh. Did you find anything you like?",
        "Alison: No. Not really.",
        "Jamal: Well, just so you know, I think that you will look great in anything you choose.",
        "Alison: Thanks. So --",
        "Jamal: What's up?",
        "Alison: Have you been back to town?",
        "Jamal: I come and go.",
        "Alison: Right. Well, have you seen Rafe?",
        "Jamal: No, but Frank said that he stopped by the Elixir.",
        "Alison: The Elixir? Why would he go to the Elixir?",
        "Jamal: I don't know, but he was smashed out of his skull, I know that. He was announcing to the world that he was retiring as a vampire slayer.",
        "Alison: That doesn't sound like something he would say.",
        "Jamal: None of us are sounding much like ourselves these days, now, are we?",
        "Alison: No. No, we're not.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Alison: So, how are you doing?",
        "Jamal: I'm good, I'm good. Turns out I got this vampire thing handled.",
        "Alison: That's a little hard to imagine.",
        "Jamal: No, believe it. And the world's still going around and around, and --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: The one thing you can count on is people change, baby.",
        "Alison: Yeah, people change, I know that. Lots of things change. Who would've ever thought, Jamal, that you would be a vampire, and I would be looking through magazines for a wedding gown so I could walk down the aisle with Joshua Temple.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. It was always hard for you to roll with the punches.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Unlike myself.",
        "Alison: Right. Look, let me ask you a question --",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Since it's just us here. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that all of this is ok with you, that you are perfectly fine and happy living as a vampire.",
        "Joshua: Well, Jamal? Tell us how sincere you really are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Please, let it have worked. God, I am begging you that the antidote be real. Let my bite be the one thing that can save you. That's right, you rest, my love. You rest now, and then you come back to me, do you hear me? You come back to me as you used to be, with all your beauty and power and grace. Don't let me live this life without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Look, Alison, I know you don't exactly want to hear this, but --",
        "[Jamal sighs]",
        "Jamal: I'm feeling this vampire stuff. It's kind of working for me, you know?",
        "Alison: No, no, I don't know, but it doesn't really matter now because this is the new world I'm living in.",
        "Jamal: I'm so sorry.",
        "Alison: What are you sorry for? I mean, honestly, it doesn't -- doesn't even really matter anymore. I need to start believing that this is really happening because I'm about to become a bride and it doesn't get more real than that.",
        "Jamal: Look, I know this isn't the life that you exactly imagined yourself having --",
        "Alison: Oh, no. Oh, no.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Alison: The life that I imagined having seems like a very, very long time ago, like one big fat dream.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, it's definitely a different world, but maybe -- I know you don't want to do this, ok -- but maybe it won't be so bad.",
        "Alison: God, forgive me for saying this, but Joshua really hasn't been that repulsive in the last few days.",
        "Jamal: He seems to be trying, doesn't he?",
        "Alison: I think that he has some sort of real emotion on a certain level, and he seems to be generally concerned whether or not I'm happy and he hasn't forced himself on me, and there's something to be said for that.",
        "Jamal: And also, he wants you to care about him, too.",
        "Alison: Yeah. He let me call my mom.",
        "Jamal: Really?",
        "Alison: And he let Rafe go free, you know, safe. That's all that matters is keeping him safe. I mean, I asked for these things, and he did give me these things.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you never know. I mean, maybe you'll fall in love with him.",
        "Alison: Jamal, I am a romantic, you know that. I believe in soul mates.",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: And I know Rafe is my soul mate. I know it. And he always will be. Nobody can take that away from me. But there's no law that says that you need to marry someone for love. And with a soul mate, you're always connected, somehow, some way out there. So I think for now that's just -- that's got to be enough.",
        "Jamal: So, what -- sounds like you're giving up.",
        "Alison: No, no, I am not giving up. I'm just -- I'm giving in, that's all. I mean, I'll obviously never forget about Rafe. I can't. But for right now, I think the only place that I'll see Rafe is in my dreams. Because after all, isn't that where they say that soul mates meet, is in your dreams?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I just need to keep him safe, and I need to keep him alive. That is the most important thing. And who knows? Maybe I can help Joshua become a better person or vampire or whatever you want to say.",
        "[Jamal chuckles]",
        "Jamal: Yeah and are you ready for what follows after that? Because it's inevitable. Eventually, you're going to have to become one of us.",
        "Alison: No. I think for right now, I'm just going to try and take one step at a time.",
        "Jamal: I don't know. It's easier than you think. It's one of those things that kind of just grows on you.",
        "Alison: Well, I kind of doubt that.",
        "Jamal: Well, hey, look at Livvie. She didn't want any part of it, and look at her now.",
        "Alison: No, no, no, don't do that. You know me better than that. Don't ever compare me and Livvie in the same sentence again, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Please, it has to work. The antidote has to be real. Oh, God, please tell me I didn't kill you. Oh, please, you have to come back to me so we can live our dream together. Just you and me loving each other. Caleb, please, we can have everything together, please. Caleb?",
        "Caleb: Olivia.",
        "[Livvie chuckles]",
        "Livvie: Hey, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: I'm back. I'm back and I'm me. At least I think I'm me. Feels like me.",
        "Livvie: Well, what does it feel like?",
        "[Caleb laughs]",
        "Caleb: It feels like I want to howl at the moon. I -- it feels like life. I can breathe. I can smell. I can taste.",
        "[Caleb howls]",
        "Caleb: I feel alive again. Come here.",
        "Livvie: You are back!",
        "Caleb: Oh, I'm back. Oh, I'm back. This is life. I feel alive again. I'm back, you hear me? I'm back. Caleb Morley is back!",
        "Livvie: Shh. Shh. You're going to cause a rockslide, and then we'll be trapped in here forever. That wouldn't be such a bad thing, but we've got plans, ok?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, we do. and we're going to put them into action right now. Right now. Olivia, I need you to concentrate, all right? Close your eyes and be with me. Open your eyes.",
        "[Owl hoots]",
        "[Caleb and Livvie laugh]",
        "Livvie: You are definitely back. I almost forgot what it was like to have you with all your power and glory.",
        "Caleb: No. You haven't had me yet, sweetheart. Not even close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe's voice: They sent me back!",
        "Alison: Rafe! Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Whoo! They sent me back to be with you!",
        "Alison: Hurry, please. Please. Hurry! Come on.",
        "Rafe's voice: You saved my soul. Your love is what made me remember.",
        "Alison's voice: We really were --",
        "Rafe's voice: And you thought that you freed me so I can go back up there, but what you really did -- what you really did was that you opened the doors of heaven so that I could stay here.",
        "Alison: It's perfect.",
        "Rafe's voice: We should stay on this train. That's what we should do, and we should just take it as far as we want and just see where it takes us.",
        "Alison: This could easily be the most perfect, most miraculous day of my life.",
        "Rafe's voice: I thought nothing could come between us. Well, how could I have been so wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Look, I know what you're going through hurts right now, because I was going through exactly the same thing before I got turned.",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry about all of that. That was really hard for you.",
        "Jamal: Don't even worry about it. I mean, what do you expect? You know what I mean? I mean, I thought you were dead, so to me, life wasn't even worth living at all. But, Alison, I got to tell you, this is so much better and, look, I know you're feeling alone and everything, but I can promise you this -- look at me -- I will not abandon you, ever.",
        "Alison: Do you really mean that?",
        "Jamal: What? How can you even ask me that? I mean, you were my first love. A brother just doesn't forget something like that.",
        "Alison: I guess that's something they can never take away from us, right?",
        "Jamal: All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Jamal: Ok. So when I tell you that you're making the right move by marrying this guy, it is not because I have some type of ulterior motive, ok?",
        "Alison: Well, this is going to take a little getting used to, that's all.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, all we have is time, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: And I'm here, and I'm going to get you through this.",
        "Alison: Do you swear?",
        "Jamal: I swear.",
        "Jamal: Is that better? Hmm? You fine?",
        "Alison: I really wish it were that simple.",
        "Jamal: Well, like you said --",
        "[Alison sighs]",
        "Jamal: Just give it some time, ok? You'll be fine, trust me.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: I know you will.",
        "Alison: Hey, thanks, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: No problem. Just call me if you need me. All right.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Jamal: No problem, baby.",
        "Joshua: Very touching, your little walk down memory lane.",
        "Jamal: You heard?",
        "Joshua: You play the hero very well. Remind me next time to give you a nice, big, white horse.",
        "Jamal: Well, we go back a long way. We have history together, so --",
        "Joshua: You were born the day I decided to turn you into a vampire. Anything else before that is irrelevant, unless it serves my purpose and no more of these chaste, little kisses, giving her false hope. And don't you ever touch her again. And you'd better take me seriously. Otherwise, I'll find ways to torture both of you that you cannot even imagine you'll suffer.",
        "Alison: Rafe? are you out there? Are you thinking about me as much as I'm thinking about you? Every time I close my eyes, I see your face, and I can feel your touch, and your soft, sweet lips. No matter what happens, you will always have my heart. I just wish that you were here with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Too many memories. Too many memories. It just hurts. It hurts -- it hurts too much. Yeah, so here's the thing -- I'm not going to be coming back here again. At least not any time soon.",
        "Rafe: You understand that, right?",
        "Alison's voice: Goodbye, Rafe. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Wow.",
        "Caleb: Promised fireworks.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and you delivered.",
        "Caleb: I also promised you a life you couldn't begin to imagine.",
        "Livvie: How can mortals think what they do is called living?",
        "Caleb: There was a -- there was a moment when I was mortal -- just the briefest moment in time -- when it didn't look like there was a way out for me and in that moment, I actually told myself that I thought I could live this way, that I would learn to be happy being nothing, being a nobody, a man who lives and dies and never leaves behind any -- anything to tell the world he was even here.",
        "Livvie: Hey, you could never be nothing. It's not in your destiny.",
        "Caleb: Maybe I'll -- maybe I'll send Joshua a nice bottle of champagne before I destroy him.",
        "Livvie: Don't bother. He wouldn't appreciate it.",
        "Caleb: I appreciate so much of what I lost and what I am. Owe them -- the slayers, Joshua. I should thank them for pushing me in that water and stealing the deepest part of my soul.",
        "Livvie: But you have that back now.",
        "[Owl hoots]",
        "Caleb: I am reborn and I will never take this life for granted again.",
        "Livvie: You know, if I could choose, I would choose this. I would never go back. I mean, I know what it feels like to -- to feel indestructible and now that we're together, nothing can hurt us, nobody.",
        "Caleb: Don't say that. We are still vulnerable. You need to learn to defend yourself, to use your strength and harness your power. In the meantime, we'll keep our arms around each other and our eyes on the prize.",
        "Caleb: I will never lose this again.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Karen: I've gone to the Elixir, and Frank wasn't there.",
        "Elizabeth: Did you go to his house?",
        "Karen: No, I didn't go to his house.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, then I will.",
