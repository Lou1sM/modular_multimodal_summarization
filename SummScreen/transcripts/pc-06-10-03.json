{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Elizabeth and Kevin push Karen into going to Frank for more of the drug. Elizabeth's jealousy resurfaces as she and Kevin await Karen's return. Frank becomes annoyed when Rafe's arrival at the Elixir is closely followed by Casey's. He strongly advises Ricky to go through with his promise to cause the guardian angel's fall from grace. Karen finds Frank at the club and asks for enough of the drug to allow her to help Kevin get through the withdrawal. Frank informs her that Kevin was cut off under Joshua's orders. Questioning Karen's sudden affection for Kevin, Frank relents and hands over a small amount of the drug, specifying that there won't be any more after this. Lucy tracks Rafe down at the club to demand an explanation for his actions. When Rafe refuses to defend himself in a beating by a vampire, Lucy tells her cousin that she's ashamed of him. Ricky calls Reese to say that although the VH1 special bombed, they do have an NV3 deal. He makes a show of coming onto Casey when Frank is looking, and Casey warns him about his behavior. Seeing a man who looks like Ian from the back, Lucy puts her arms around the man, whose name is Ted. Confused, Lucy swears that Ian was just there. Concerned, Casey helps her friend out of the club. When Karen returns to the lighthouse, Elizabeth wants to take over her efforts to help Kevin, but Karen doesn't want her hovering around. Kevin gets rid of Elizabeth so that he can get his injection. Frank watches Karen and Kevin jealously through the window. After telling Joshua that she appreciates his efforts to make her comfortable, Alison is shocked to walk in on Jamul's first feeding. Her reaction causes Joshua to doubt her honesty, but Alison reminds him that her adjustment to this lifestyle will take time. Jamal assures Alison that life as a vampire is good. Alison allows Joshua to comfort her as she tries to figure out what's right. Tired of feeling confused and putting off the inevitable, Alison informs a surprised Joshua that she wants to marry him tonight."], "Recap Author": "Beth", "Show Title": "Port Charles", "Transcript": ["kevin: Oh, come on.

I can't take it.", "Elizabeth: Ok, I was just trying to distract you.", "kevin: You know, the only thing that's going to make me feel better is karen walking through that door and handing me my medicine.", "elizabeth: Well, listen, in the meantime, why don't you just --", "kevin: Why? Why? Because I don't want to sketch you.

I need to be useful.", "kevin: Well, you're not being useful. and frankly, I don't care what you want or whatou need. all that matters to me right now is what I want and what I need.", "elizabeth: What matters right now is where karen is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "frank: So what kind of favor are you looking for, karen?", "Karen: Kevin's having withdrawal symptoms from the drug joshua gave him.", "Frank: And you need me to be your supplier. well, I'm not the guy, sweetheart. joshua cut him off. that was his order.", "karen: His order is dangerous, and it's inhuman.", "frank: We're not human. and besides, when did you start to care about kevin so much?", "karen: Since I made him my patient. he used to help people once. Remember, frank?", "frank: I remember a lot of things, karen.", "karen: Don'T.", "Frank: Why not? I miss you.", "Karen: Enough to say yes? enough to give me the drug?", "frank: Come inside with me.", "karen: Frank, please --", "frank: Inside, now.", "karen: Frank, will you wait, please?", "karen: Will you just answer me yes or no and stop playing these games?", "frank: No games, karen.

Just messing around.", "casey: Messing around? ok. all right, well, you know what? Do me a favor. Don't ever mess around like that again.", "ricky: Hey, kool & the gang. Oh, and speaking of cool, like lay it out on the slab, what's -- what's rafe doing hanging around here? what, has he got a death wish or something?", "casey: That's a very good question.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: I'm not buying it. I'm not buying it at all.", "Rafe: I don't want to talk ababout this. I don't want to think about this. I don't want to feel anything, ok?

I know that. so tell me why you can just give up like that. tell me.", "rafe: Can you just go away, please?", "Lucy: No, I can'T. No, I won't go away. Rafe, it's me. I know you and alison sacrificed way too much to be together, so I'm sure you're not going to just quit on her.", "Rafe: It's her choice.", "Lucy: Well, it's the wrong choice, obviously. she must think she's doing some good for everybody, but that's not what's happening. you -- us -- we're supposed to be the ones that take out joshua. We're the slayers here. Now, I am not ok here.

You have just crossed the line. rafe? rafe, get up! rafe!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "alison: No, I'm not lying to you. I think that you know how uncomfortable I am with the whole vampire world, but I am doing my best to adst to it. I'm giving you my honest effort, and you still don't believe me?", "Joshua: To be frank with you, I'm not convinced.", "alison: Well, I'm sorry, but this display that I just walked in on -- it rattled me a little bit, but I will do my best to try and live with it.", "joshua: Well, the sooner the better, alison.", "jamal: Uh -- spunky -- look, don't be afraid, ok? because there's nothing to be afraid of.
