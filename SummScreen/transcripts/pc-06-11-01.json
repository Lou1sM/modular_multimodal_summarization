        "Chris: Denny. Thanks for getting down here so fast. ",
        "Denny: Hey, you're a good customer. ",
        "Chris: Hey, I have a very important job for you. It's serious. ",
        "Denny: Don't tell me it's about that girl again -- Livvie. ",
        "Chris: No, I don't need information on her. ",
        "Denny: Who, then? ",
        "Chris: My brother Jack. ",
        "Denny: Already got all the dirt on that guy -- the car thefts, the arrests.\r\n",
        "Chris: No, you don't understand. He's disappeared. ",
        "Denny: Disappeared? ",
        "Chris: He's gone without a trace. I want you to find him. ",
        "",
        "Sam: Well, I don't think it is a waste of time, Zach. I think we need to be \r\nsure. Because I don't want this coming back and biting us in the butt, all \r\nright? Listen, I'll call you back later. As soon as I know Jack Ramsey's dead.\r\n",
        "",
        "Kevin: Something's going on with the kids. They tell us that Jack left town.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but why? Why would he do that? He's crazy about Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: Jamal and Alison have been acting so strange lately. ",
        "Alison: It won't come off. Jack's blood, it's all over me. No! ",
        "",
        "Kevin: What was that? ",
        "Lucy: It sounded like Alison. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Here, try this, try this. Ok? See? See, that's working. See, it's all \r\ncoming off. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: It's ok. No, no, it's ok. It's all right. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: It's coming off, baby. Come on. ",
        "Kevin: What was that? ",
        "Lucy: Alison, what -- what is it? What happened? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Who are you? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I said, who are you? ",
        "Livvie: And what do you want? ",
        "",
        "Denny: Don't worry. Anything fishy's going on, I'll find out about it. Or \r\nmaybe you'd rather I check into that. ",
        "Chris: Just find my brother, will you? And be quick about it. ",
        "Denny: All right. ",
        "Chris: Excuse me. Is there anything at all that I could help you with? ",
        "Sam: Yeah, I'm looking for a friend. I thought he might have been brought in.\r\n",
        "Chris: Ok. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. ",
        "Sam: Sam. ",
        "Chris: Very cute. ",
        "Sam: Short for Samantha. ",
        "Chris: I wasn't talking about your name. ",
        "Sam: Going to tell me yours? ",
        "Chris: Sure. It's Chris. Short for brilliant chief resident of General \r\nHospital. You know, I like candlelit dinners and fast cars and lots and lots of \r\nleather. ",
        "Sam: I can see why you shortened it. ",
        "Chris: Hmm. This friend of yours -- that would be? ",
        "Sam: That would be Jack. ",
        "Chris: Jack. That's a shame. Couldn't have been a Jill, huh? ",
        "Sam: Sorry. ",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. All right. Let's take a look. Jack, huh? Let's see if this \r\nJack is here. Jack Armstrong? Is that the guy? ",
        "Sam: Nope. ",
        "Chris: Jack Dandorfer. No, couldn't -- couldn't be. I mean, pretty girl like \r\nyou wouldn't be caught dead with a Dandorfer. ",
        "Sam: Wouldn't it be easier if I just told you his last name? ",
        "Chris: Well, sure, but then you'd have your answer, and what would you need \r\nme for? ",
        "Sam: Oh, I can think of a few things. ",
        "Chris: Really? ",
        "Sam: But first things first. My friend's name is Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Jack Ramsey? ",
        "Sam: Yeah, is he here? ",
        "Chris: No, he isn't. ",
        "Sam: But you didn't even check the list. ",
        "Chris: I don't have to. Jack Ramsey's my brother. ",
        "Sam: Your brother? ",
        "Chris: How do you know him? Why do you think he'd be here in the hospital?\r\n",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ali just had a cut on her hand. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'm so sorry for the scream and stuff. I just -- I'm such a \r\nwimp. I just saw the blood -- ",
        "Kevin: Here, why don't I take a look at it? ",
        "Alison: No. ",
        "Jamal: No. That's ok. ",
        "Alison: I'm ok now. It just looked a lot worse than it was. ",
        "Lucy: Are you really sure? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm positive. You know? Oh, look. See? It's -- no more \r\nbleeding. It stopped bleeding. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, it was more of a scratch than a cut, anyway. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's exactly what it was. It was just a scratch. Thank you, \r\nKevin, though, for that -- wanting to look at it. That's very nice of you. ",
        "Jamal: So where's -- where's Livvie? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, is she ok? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, no, not really. She's not ok at all. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's why I asked you guys to stop by and check on her. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: I'm glad you did. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Um, listen, she really, really is devastated by Jack leaving \r\ntown. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Is she still in his room? ",
        "Lucy: No, she took off. ",
        "Kevin: Said she needed to go somewhere.",
        "Lucy: Maybe you two know why she had to head out or where she went, hmm? ",
        "Alison: No. ",
        "Jamal: Not a clue. I don't know. ",
        "Alison: No, I don't. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I thought maybe, you know, it might have something to do with \r\nJack's disappearance and all. ",
        "Jamal: Jack didn't disappear. He just bailed. Simple as that. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that's exactly what Livvie said. But -- ",
        "Alison: But what? ",
        "Lucy: But it doesn't -- it doesn't make sense. We all know how much Jack \r\ncared about Livvie, and it doesn't make sense for him to leave town without any \r\ngood reason. ",
        "Kevin: Not to mention people usually don't \"bail\" without their wallet. ",
        "Lucy: Or all their stuff. All his clothes -- it's all still there. ",
        "Kevin: And judging from Jack's room, it looks like he left without so much as \r\na toothbrush. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, you know, that's because -- ",
        "Alison: He just had to leave so fast. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you know Jack. He's just -- once he gets an itch, man, he's just \r\n-- he's out of there, you know? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. He's always been one to travel light. ",
        "Jamal: Light. ",
        "Kevin: All right, both of you, what is it you're not telling us? ",
        "Alison: Excuse me? ",
        "Jamal: What are you talking about? ",
        "Kevin: And since it involves my daughter, I'm about to get to the bottom of \r\nit. ",
        "Jamal: What are you -- the bottom of what? ",
        "Kevin: The whole story. And I want it right now. ",
        "Livvie: You're right, Dad. There is more to this story. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: I'll tell you what really happened to Jack.",
        "",
        "Chris: You've gone quiet all of a sudden. ",
        "Sam: I'm -- I'm surprised. ",
        "Chris: How do you know my brother? ",
        "Sam: Oh, we've gone out a couple times. ",
        "Chris: Gone out? ",
        "Sam: Yeah. ",
        "Chris: So you're saying he's been cheating on his girlfriend, huh? The love \r\nof his life? Is that it? ",
        "Sam: What can I say? He likes a good time. ",
        "Chris: Wait a second. You were at the Recovery Room with Jack. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, that's right. ",
        "Chris: So you do know him well. ",
        "Sam: Well enough to know he's not nearly as cute as his big brother. In fact, \r\nyou two aren't anything alike. ",
        "Chris: No, we're not. ",
        "Sam: Maybe I went for the wrong Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Save it. ",
        "Sam: What? ",
        "Chris: Something's going on with my brother. Batting your eyelashes isn't \r\ngoing to make me forget. ",
        "Sam: Look, I have no idea -- ",
        "Chris: I've been looking for him all day. Now what do you know? ",
        "Sam: Yeah, I told you I've been looking for him, too. ",
        "Chris: Why? What happened? ",
        "Sam: Why do you think anything happened? ",
        "Chris: I went down to the bike shop. I saw his buddies. They were acting \r\nstrange. ",
        "Sam: Strange how? ",
        "Chris: Now you show up here asking if he's been admitted. ",
        "Sam: No, no. I thought he worked here. ",
        "Chris: Don't play games with me. ",
        "Sam: He said that sometimes he volunteers. ",
        "Chris: That's why you had me checking the patient list? ",
        "Sam: I didn't know what list you were checking. ",
        "Chris: You said you thought your friend may have been brought in. ",
        "Sam: Come on, I was flustered, you were flirting with me. ",
        "Chris: Give me a break, honey. ",
        "Sam: Oh, come on. You weren't trying to hit on me? ",
        "Chris: Ok, I'll tell you what. I'll give you one last chance. Either you tell \r\nme what you know about my brother, or I call the police. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Livvie, just tell us the truth, then. Tell us what happened to Jack.\r\n",
        "Alison: We already did, Livvie. We told them how he had to leave town without \r\nsaying goodbye. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we already knew you wanted to cover for him, so -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and she did, you know, because she was really concerned about \r\nwhat you guys would think. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: Jamal, Alison, I appreciate what you guys are trying to do, but we \r\ncan't hide this forever. ",
        "Jamal: All right, Livvie, wait. ",
        "Livvie: No, people are bound to find out. You have to know that. ",
        "Alison: Not if they don't have to. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Find out what? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, just talk to us. What is going on? ",
        "Livvie: Jack was, um, caught stealing from the bike shop. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know. I couldn't believe it, either. None of us could. But \r\nit's true. He was totally ripping them off. ",
        "Kevin: Why am I not surprised? ",
        "Livvie: And of course they had to fire him from the business. ",
        "Kevin: Did you call the police? ",
        "Jamal: No, no. The guy felt bad as it was. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, he was humiliated. He thought he had gotten past all that. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you know, I really thought he had, too. ",
        "Livvie: That's why he left so fast -- because he let us all down, and I don't \r\nthink that he could face anyone. ",
        "Kevin: So now he really is gone? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Actually, that's -- that's where I just was. Saying good-bye.\r\n",
        "Lucy: You saw Jack? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I saw him. ",
        "Kevin: Honey, I'm so sorry. ",
        "Livvie: Oh -- yeah, it's ok. It's for the best. He's going to make a fresh \r\nstart somewhere else. ",
        "Kevin: What about all of his things? His wallet? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, um -- he told me that he's going to send for all of his things \r\nonce he gets settled. ",
        "Jamal: Kevin, sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. ",
        "Kevin: Don't worry about it. I'm sorry if I gave you a hard time. ",
        "Jamal: Don't worry about it. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, actually, it still doesn't really make sense. I mean, \r\nJack's had scrapes with the law, but to do this to betray his friends like that \r\n-- ",
        "Alison: He didn't betray his friends. He just -- he couldn't get past it, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. And Jack, he's a good guy, you know? He's a real good guy. You \r\nknow, someday soon, people are going to -- they're going to really know that.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Livvie, I really am sorry. ",
        "Livvie: It's -- it's ok. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, it's not. In fact, why don't you come and stay with us at the \r\nlighthouse tonight. ",
        "Livvie: Oh -- you know, I couldn't. ",
        "Kevin: Sure you can. Your grandmother and Archie are gone on that cruise. \r\nYou'd be there all alone. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know, but -- I just -- ",
        "Kevin: I would feel better if you did. ",
        "[Livvie sighs] ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Let's go. ",
        "Livvie: Um, I just need a minute with my friends, if you don't mind. ",
        "Kevin: No, of course not. Take your time. ",
        "Lucy: We'll be waiting in the car. I've got to grab my purse. I left it in \r\nJack's room. ",
        "[Door closes] ",
        "Jamal: I hate this! I hate this, doing this to Jack and his memory. Now, he \r\ndeserves better than this. He deserves a hell of a lot better than this. ",
        "Livvie: Don't you think I hate it, too? It killed me to have to say that \r\nstuff about him. ",
        "Alison: Look, Livvie, you did what you had to, ok? We understand, and Jack \r\nwould understand. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? They bought it. Ok? That's what's important here, all \r\nright? ",
        "Livvie: No. What's important is that we make Zach pay for what he did to \r\nJack. ",
        "Alison: And we will, Livvie, ok? Listen to me, I promise. Livvie, you're \r\nshaking. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know. I think I -- I caught a chill or something when I went \r\ndown by the river. ",
        "Alison: Is that where you went? You were at the river? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I wanted -- I wanted to feel close to him. ",
        "Alison: And did you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I did. But -- but there was -- there was this guy -- ",
        "Jamal: What guy? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. It was some guy in the bushes watching me. ",
        "Alison: Are you serious? ",
        "Jamal: What, did you recognize him? Was he one of Zach's crew? ",
        "Livvie: No, no. I've never seen him before in my life, but he really got to \r\nme. ",
        "Alison: Did he say or do anything? ",
        "Livvie: No. He just -- he -- he just stared and then took off. ",
        "Alison: Well, that's really weird. ",
        "Livvie: What's even weirder is that he looked at me like he knew me. ",
        "",
        "Alison: I'm so glad that Livvie is staying with her dad tonight. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, she was pretty much a wreck. ",
        "Alison: I know, and with that guy freaking her out at the river like that --\r\n",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but she'll be ok at Kevin's. ",
        "Alison: I know, still, but just the thought of it. That's really weird. ",
        "Jamal: Sweetie, don't think about it. Ok? We got enough to deal with. ",
        "Alison: You know what I wish I could stop thinking about is Jack's body lying \r\nin the ground out in the middle of nowhere. ",
        "Jamal: I know. Me, too. ",
        "Alison: He was such a good friend to us. He was the best. ",
        "Jamal: Well, once we get all this straightened out, ok, we'll do right by \r\nhim. Ok, give Jack the props he deserves. ",
        "Alison: Nothing is going to get straightened out, Jamal, until we find a way \r\nto nail Zach for what he did without you getting the blame. ",
        "Jamal: I already told you, I got that covered. ",
        "Alison: Who? Billy? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, first thing tomorrow, I'm going to go see him. Ok, find out what \r\nhappened at that race that put him in that wheelchair. ",
        "Alison: Do you really think that he will go to the cops with you and just \r\ntotally rat out Zach? ",
        "Jamal: No, he's got to, ok, because I will not rest until that bastard's \r\nbehind bars. ",
        "",
        "Sam: Look, I don't know what more I can tell you. ",
        "Chris: You can tell me what the connection is between you and my brother -- \r\nthe real connection. ",
        "Sam: He's a friend. ",
        "Chris: He's been hurt, hasn't he? ",
        "Sam: No. I mean, I -- I don't know. ",
        "Chris: Yes, you do know, but for some reason you're hiding it. ",
        "Sam: Now, why would I do that? ",
        "Chris: Maybe it's time we find out. ",
        "Sam: What are you doing? ",
        "Chris: I told you, I'm calling the police. ",
        "Sam: No, wait! ",

        "Chris: Wait a second. What is it? ",
        "Deneice: Your T.C. in 612 is complaining of back pain. She can't sleep. ",
        "Chris: All right. Start morphine. Two to eight milligrams, I.V. push. Titrate \r\nto effect. I'll be right there. ",

        "Livvie: Yeah, I just -- I think I'd really like to be alone now. ",
        "Kevin: That's fine. Can I get you anything? Something to eat or drink? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, maybe just a blanket. It's kind of cold in here. ",
        "Kevin: One blanket coming up. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. You know, I'm a little chilly, too. It's kind of strange for June, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Well -- no wonder we're both cold. Doc left the door open. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. There we go. But you know what? I really am cold. I feel like some \r\nhot chocolate. Do you want some? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I'll make some. ",
