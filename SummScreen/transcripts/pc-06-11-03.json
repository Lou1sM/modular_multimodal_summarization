{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["A concerned Casey stands by to support Lucy while a nurse takes another blood sample for Chris. Against Lucy's wishes, Casey calls Ian to let him know that she's been readmitted. Lucy is determined to check herself out of the hospital and try to help rid the town of Joshua, but Casey refuses to let her leave. When Ian arrives, Lucy fills him in on what happened at the Elixir, maintaining that she was simply confused, not hallucinating. To Ian's chagrin, she chatters about having made blueberry pancakes for Danny this morning. Almost immediately afterward, she demonstrates her awareness that Danny has been in New York with Tim for quite some time. Casey panics after having another vision of Lucy lying in a casket. Ian informs Chris and Casey that Lucy is losing touch with reality. Chris is willing to do another transfusion but warns that the results don't last and that she'll need yet another one right away. Casey voices the unthinkable conclusion that Lucy is dying and that there's nothing the doctors can do. While Ian watches sadly, Lucy hallucinates a visit with Christina.", "Rafe wraps up an important phone call and tries to head out the door, but he is stopped by Caleb, who wants to talk about banding together again to take down Joshua and rescue Alison. After a shoving match using their respective powers, Rafe finally relents and agrees to join forces with Caleb, but he's desperate to get to Alison first. While Alison nervously prepares to go through with the wedding, she tries to reassure herself that Rafe will come through for her. Jamal finds her and takes her to her anxious groom. Joshua and Alison exchange wedding vows and rings. Mustering all her willpower, Alison kisses her groom while trying to remove the ring that protects him. Joshua grabs her wrist and vows to make her pay."], "Recap Author": "Beth", "Show Title": "Port Charles", "Transcript": ["lulucy: I'm really fine. I'm -- I mean, I feel -- fine.

I think it was when you first kissed me.", "ian: No, I -- I -- come on.", "lucy: I'm serious. I'm being very serious here. I'm feeling fine. I just would feel so much better after the transfusion.", "ian: You haven't got one yet?", "lucy: No. chris said he was going to come back, and all he did was take some of my blood and take off, and he hasn't come back.", "ian: Is that right?", "lucy: Yeah, and I want to get out of here. you know, I really want to go with danny. I just -- I lo h having him stay with us. I love it.", "ian: Danny's in new york. You know that.", "lucy: What?", "ian: He's staying with tim. I mean, you know that he's been staying with tim ever since the vampire thing started over again.", "lucy: With tim -- right. I know what you're doing. This is some sort of little test. well, it's not going to work because i know for a fact what your son looked like when I left him this morning, and he was blue. see, what happened was I tried to make those pancakes, you know, and I put too many blueberries, so his first bite, it was, like, all blue. And then by the time he finished eating -- head to toe completely -- you wouldn't even recognize your son. he's all blue now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "caleb: I don't like this an more than you do, but we are stronger if we take on joshua together.", "rafe: We tried that, ok?", "caleb: We also -- we also betrayed each other. I think we know better now. It'll take both of us. that was true then, and it's true now.", "rafe: Whoa, whoa, whoa -- truth? Don't even talk to me about the truth. You wouldn't know it if it --", "caleb: If it what? If it bit me? let me tell you something. This much I do know -- if you love alison at all, you'll put aside your differences and work with me instead of against me.", "rafe: Oh, really? Why would I do that? I know the real reason you're here begging me now --", "caleb: Begging.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: For my help is because neither you nor livvie can get anywhere near joshua as long as he has that ring, and that's what you really want, right? you want that stupid ring.", "Caleb: That ring is mine. it's part of my heritage. and, yes, it protects joshua from me now, but it's been in my family for generations. that's why I have to have it back.", "Rafe: You want it back because it gives you more power. So by all means, go ahead. go ahead. Go and g it. but just so you know, I wouldn't help you and livvie cross the street, all right? so get the hell out of my way. Ok. fine, if you don't want to do it, I'll do it for you, ok?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "caleb: You want to play? let's play. now it's your turn again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "joshua: You are so divine. You are remarkable.", "alison: I'm so glad you're pleased.", "Joshua: Pleased? I can't find the words. that dress is breathtaking on you. I think anything you wear would be breathtaking -- even without clothes, quite frankly.", "jamal: Joshua --", "joshua: I think we'd rather exchange our vows privately. Close the door when you leave.", "Alison: Wait, no, please. Will you let him stay?", "Joshua: Why? We don't need a witness for our ritual.", "alison: I know, but ever since I was a little girl, I always imagined having friends and family there with me on my day. so if I could just have one friend -- please, for me?", "joshua: All right, you come here and stay silent. alison -- so soft, so warm. and soon you'll be all mine.", "[Music plays]", "joshua: Come with me. Come with me.", "joshua: From the first moment I saw you, I knew we would stand before this ritual flame together. you and I together will be nothing short of perfection. ambition meets submission, power meets charm and breeding. and with you and I together, nothing is outside of our reach. with our union this evening, and every other night, it will be the greatest thing this world has ever seen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "lucy: I bet that you were a lot like dan when you were that agebebecause you're still a very messy eater. You know that.", "ian: Yeah, I know, I know. he pbably got that from me.", "Lucy: Yeah. did you call him today?", "ian: Did I call danny today?", "lucy: No, not danny, tim. you know, tim -- the guy who's taking care of your son in new york?", "ian: So -- so you know that danny's in new york. you know that.", "lucy: Yeah. He's been there since the vampires came back. Of course I know that.", "ian: And you're sure about that?", "Lucy: Of course I'm sure about that. Why -- why are you acting like this? What's going on?", "ian: I need to find chris and see what's going on with the test results.", "lucy: Well, casey said she'd do tt.", "Ian: I know, but I know his hiding places. It'll be faster.", "lucy: But I don't want you to go --", "ian: I won't be long.", "Lucy: Ok.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "casey: Are you all right, ian?", "ian: Lucy -- she --", "chris: Ian?", "ian: She's losing touch with reality. She's in and out, and she -- and you're not surprised by that because you've got the test results.", "chris: Yeah, the toxins in her bloodstream are building up. they're even stronger than before.", "Ian: Ok, let's do a transfusion right now and --", "chris: Yeah, well, that's an option, ian, but I don't know if --", "ian: What? You don't know what? It's worked before, so let's do it again.", "Chris: The results don't last, ian. one look at those numbers shows you that if we give her a transfusion, she's just going to need another one right away. we're all out of cards to play.", "ian: What are you -- what are you saying? What, you know -- you don't know what you're saying because you don't even know what the problem is. So when I --", "chris: No, no, I'm not saying it because I don't want to say it. all I know for sure is what those numbers are telling me.", "casey: She's dying. lucy's dying, and there's nothing you can do.", "ian: I --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Lucy giggles]", "lucy: Oh. I am so glad you came for a visit. I've missed you so much. oh, mommy's ssed you. you know, I bet you had fun at play group today, didn't you? you can tell me all about it. but I thought first we should go to the store and get you a nice, new dress.

Like that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Lucy gileles]", "rafe: No, I don't have time for this, ok?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: Make time. I'm not moving, and you can't do anything about it. we just established that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: I swear --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "caleb: You're not going anywhere, not until you agree to give this a shot.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "joshua: Alison?", "jamal: Ali?", "alison: What? What?", "[Music plays]", "joshua: The vows, my sweet.", "alison: Oh, right, the vows. Um -- I promise to always be loyal to you.", "jouaua: And?", "alison: And I promise to always live up to your expectations.", "joshua: And?", "alison: And what?", "joshua: Maybe a couple of words, improvise a few sweet nothings just for me?", "alison: Um -- joshua, I'm sorry, but this is not exactly the way that I thought my life would turn out. but I'm going to do the best that I can, and I'm going to try and accept the way that things have to be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Rafe groans]", "rafe: All right!
