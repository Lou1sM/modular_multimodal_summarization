{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Refusing to let Rafe put him off, Ian knocks him out and carries him to the hospital, where he fills Chris in on his latest plan. Chris is uneasy with the idea of doing the procedure on Rafe, who obviously hasn't given his consent. Rafe is struggling to regain consciousness, and obviously has other plans. Ian insists that saving Lucy is the most important thing that Rafe could possibly do at the moment. Kevin resists Elizabeth's efforts to make him comfortable while he awaits his next injection. Karen brings the drug, but Kevin becomes very angry when he sees how little he's about to receive. An argument between Elizabeth and Karen ensues, and they take it outside, where Elizabeth accuses Karen of using Kevin's misfortune to put the moves on him. Karen threatens to have Elizabeth thrown out if she refuses to leave the hospital willingly. While Karen is distracted, Kevin takes the opportunity to prepare a larger dose for himself. Karen returns and catches him before he can go through with it. They argue about Kevin's need to get off the drug. Kevin finally gives in, filled with remorse about what he's done. Elizabeth returns and misinterprets what she sees happening between Kevin and his doctor. Abruptly turning around, she runs straight into Chris. He's amused by their head-on collision, but she's in no mood to be detained. Karen informs Kevin that the new vial of the drug is even more potent than the last one. It seems to be getting stronger and more refined, which is how Joshua kept him hooked. Kevin decides to put all his trust in Karen. Caleb is exasperated with himself for letting Rafe get away. As for Olivia's bragging about his imminent return to power, he points out that he will still be in danger until regaining possession of the ring. After eliciting a solemn vow of secrecy from Olivia, Caleb informs her that the ring has the power to grant its wearer's every wish. Caleb warns that the ring is very dangerous unless used very wisely. Olivia promises to do whatever it takes to get it back. She can't stop thinking about what it will be like to have that kind of power. As Alison gives Joshua the cold shoulder, he strokes his own ego by talking about how good he's been to her. When she tries to get past him, he grabs her arm and injects her with the same drug he used on Kevin. Alison immediately realizes what happened. She proves to be very resistant to the drug, fighting its effects with all her willpower. She eventually begins to show signs of succumbing. Realizing that she's finally ready, he orders her to pour him some tea, and she obeys."], "Recap Author": "Beth", "Show Title": "Port Charles", "Transcript": ["elizabeth: So, what else do you need here, huh? can I get you another pillow, or would you like something else to drink --", "kevin: Just please give it a rest, elizabeth.
