        "Jamal: Hey, you sure caffeine's the best thing? ",
        "Alison: Well, I need something to do while we wait for your cousin. ",
        "Jamal: Here. How about this? ",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal, I know that I said I was really ok with all this stuff \r\nearlier, but now I'm scared. You know, we know that Zach was the one that killed \r\nJack. Ok? But we also know that he is going to be the one who wants to pin it on \r\nyou. ",
        "Jamal: I know. That's why we're here, you know? Just to bust this thing wide \r\nopen, to give the suits and badges the real story -- together. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what if they get it wrong? What if they blame you just like \r\nyou said? ",
        "Jamal: Well, we kind of knew that, you know, coming in the door. But, you \r\nknow, it's worth taking that chance because we owe it to Jack to do whatever we \r\ncan to nail Zach on this thing. ",
        "Alison: No matter what happens to you or to us? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. No matter what. Remember? Together, whatever comes. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Whatever comes. ",
        "Andy: Ok, kids. You got something to say, here I am. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we're -- we're here to see Dara. ",
        "Andy: Well, she's tied up in night court, so she asked me to come down and \r\nsee what you wanted. So what's the story, Jamal? What kind of trouble you get \r\nyourself into now? ",

        "Emilio: Heads up. ",
        "Chris: Whoo. NBA stardom's going to have to wait. It's doctor time. What do \r\nwe got? ",
        "Frank: Someone who can appreciate your bedside manner -- DOA, male, early \r\n20s. ",
        "Emilio: They found him at the bottom of the ravine, north end of the park.\r\n",
        "Frank: Coroner said to bring him here, have him declared. ",
        "Chris: Ooh. Not very pretty, huh? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, a broken neck plus plenty of other souvenirs he picked up on the \r\nway down to the bottom. ",
        "Chris: Has he got a name? ",
        "Emilio: Zach Vernon. ",
        "Chris: Another celebrity. Let's park him in trauma. Call the morgue. Tell the \r\nboys that dinner's ready. ",

        "Chris: No courtside seats for you. ",

        "Kevin: Are you ok? ",
        "Victor: I -- I'm fine. Abe's the one in trouble. ",
        "Kevin: How's he feeling? ",

        "Abe: Let me go! ",
        "Kevin: Judge Kurland? ",

        "Kevin: Then calm him down. ",
        "Kevin: Victor? ",
        "Victor: What's happening, Monk? ",
        "Kevin: We don't know yet, but we will. Victor, how did this happen? And more \r\nimportantly, does Abe have any pre-existing conditions that you know about? ",
        "Victor: I wouldn't know. I can tell you this -- there's something unholy up \r\nthere in those woods. ",

        "Livvie: I'm warning you, Zach. Stay away from me. You again. ",

        "Kevin: Victor, you said \"unholy.\" What did you mean by that? ",
        "Abe: Get your hands off me, you witch! ",
        "Jill: Dr. Collins! ",
        "Abe: Do you hear me? Don't you touch me! I swear I'll rip your face off! ",
        "Kevin: Jill? Jill, what happened? ",
        "Abe: I'll kill you first! ",
        "Victor: Abe, nobody's trying to hurt you. ",
        "Abe: Get out of my face, you whining moron! ",
        "Victor: Abe, it's Victor. ",
        "Kevin: Victor -- ",
        "Victor: We've been friends for 30 years. ",
        "Kevin: Victor, please, I know you want to help, but not now. ",
        "Victor: I understand. ",
        "Abe: Help -- out! Get out! I want out! I want out! ",
        "Kevin: Abe? Abe, listen to me. Listen to me. ",
        "[Abe grunts] ",
        "Kevin: Abe, what happened to you out in the woods? Abe, do you remember why \r\nyou were brought in here? ",
        "Abe: I don't want to talk! I want out! I want air! ",

        "Chris: Hey, Frank? ",
        "Frank: Yeah? ",
        "Chris: The place where you found that guy must've been pretty gruesome, huh? \r\nA lot of blood? ",
        "Frank: Not that much. ",
        "Chris: \"Not that much\" -- right. ",
        "Frank: No, not that much blood. Why? ",
        "Chris: Because he doesn't have any. He bled to death. ",
        "Frank: Well, that's weird. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, it really is. ",
        "Frank: So what are you thinking? ",
        "Chris: Well, a guy bleeds to death and there's no blood at the scene. If he \r\ndidn't die in that ravine, somebody dumped him there. ",
        "Frank: After he died? ",
        "Chris: After he was murdered. Better call this one in. ",
        "Sam: Zach. ",

        "Alison: I think we'll just wait for Dara. Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Andy: Look, kids, you know I'm not a bad guy, right? And whatever you tell \r\nthe assistant DA is just going to get passed on to me anyway. So come on, spit \r\nout the bad news. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Um -- all right, here's the story. Jack Ramsey -- ",
        "Officer: Detective? ",
        "Andy: Yeah. ",
        "Officer: We got news on that guy that was found dead. Looks like there was \r\nsome kind of foul play involved. ",
        "Andy: You get a name on him yet? ",
        "Officer: Yeah. Zach Vernon. ",
        "Andy: All right, thanks. I'm on my way. All right, you two. Warm up your \r\nstory. I'll be back. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. I thought he was going to say that he found Jack's body.\r\n",

        "Alison: Who could've -- oh, my God. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Alison: Livvie. You know how weird she's been acting lately and she said that \r\nshe was going to get Zach back for what he did to Jack. ",
        "Jamal: We should have never left her alone. ",
        "Alison: You don't think that she could've -- ",
        "Jamal: You know, I -- I don't know what to think. I just know we better find \r\nLivvie and fast. Come on. ",

        "Livvie: Listen, whoever you are -- ",
        "Caleb: I already told you who I am. ",

        "Caleb: I know you well enough for both of us. ",
        "Livvie: I -- I don't understand. ",
        "Caleb: Something inside you does. You already know I would never hurt you, \r\ndon't you? You know that. ",
        "Livvie: Who are you? ",
        "Caleb: I'm Caleb. And you are Olivia. ",
        "Livvie: How did you know? ",
        "Caleb: Olivia -- it's the most beautiful name I know. ",
        "Livvie: You've been watching me. ",
        "Caleb: I can't take my eyes off you. ",

        "Caleb: As I have yours. ",
        "Livvie: But how? Why? ",
        "Caleb: I know your soul, your heart. I can hear it right now beating. And the \r\nminute I saw you again, my heart beats to your rhythm. Can you feel? You think \r\nyou've lost something -- someone precious. ",
        "Livvie: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: You haven't. What you need now is someone to take care of you, to \r\nprotect you. ",
        "Livvie: And you? ",
        "Caleb: Yes, I am. And you know that. That's why you believe me right now. ",

        "Caleb: You don't need to understand. ",
        "Livvie: No, I can't -- ",
        "Caleb: Olivia? ",

        "Victor: Monk. ",
        "Kevin: What exactly happened out there? I need to know everything you know.\r\n",
        "Victor: We were in the woods north of town. Abe was fine. We were getting \r\nready to hit the lake. ",
        "Kevin: Go on. ",
        "Victor: Abe discovered that he'd left some of his fishing gear in the car, so \r\nhe went back to get it. But he didn't come back. So I waited and I waited and I \r\nwaited and finally, I went looking for him. ",
        "Kevin: Where did you find him? ",
        "Victor: I found him stumbling through the brush, mumbling something about \r\nbeing cold. And one minute, he'd be leaning against my shoulder and the next \r\nminute, he'd be attacking me! Somehow I managed to get him calm enough to get \r\nhim back here. ",
        "Kevin: Victor, you said you thought there was something unholy in those \r\nwoods. What did you mean? ",
        "Victor: Monk, you know me. You know I've seen a lot of things. You know I've \r\nbeen a lot of places. I don't scare easily. But -- ",
        "Kevin: You saw something? ",
        "Victor: There was a fog all of a sudden, a very thick mist, and I don't know \r\nwhat it was -- something, some kind of animal disappearing into the woods or \r\nsomething like an animal. ",
        "Kevin: Do you think whatever it was attacked Abe? ",
        "Victor: I don't know what else to think. But what kind of an animal attacks a \r\nman and instantly he goes mad? What are you thinking? ",
        "Kevin: Jack Ramsey had a strange experience out in those woods. He \r\ndisappeared, passed out, and then turned up feeling sick. ",
        "Victor: Well, let's talk to him. ",
        "Kevin: We can't. He's gone. ",

        "Sam: He's a -- he was a friend. I heard they brought him in, and I came to \r\nsee him. What happened? ",
        "Chris: Well, someone killed him. That's what happened. Did a good job of it, \r\ntoo. But you still haven't answered my questions. How do you know him? ",
        "Sam: I don't have to answer -- ",
        "Chris: No. Listen, the other day, after you were here poking around asking \r\nquestions about my brother, I did some checking. Turns out the last time anyone \r\nsaw Jack, he was in a motorcycle race. Now, you happen to be a biker yourself \r\nand now you come back to the hospital to visit your very dead friend. ",

        "Caleb: Do I really feel like a stranger to you? ",
        "Livvie: Please. Don't look at me that way. What do you want from me? Why are \r\nyou here? ",
        "Caleb: To save you. To make you feel complete again. I can do that, Olivia. \r\nMake that emptiness you feel inside -- make it disappear forever. ",
        "Caleb: Happiness always seems to have eluded you, just out of reach. ",
        "Livvie: But I've tried so hard. ",
        "Caleb: I know you have. But you don't have to try anymore. All you have to do \r\nnow is surrender. ",

        "Kevin: Abe, this is important. Anything you can remember, try. ",
        "Abe: I don't. That's -- that's just it. I was -- I was going back to the \r\nboat. Next thing I knew, I heard Victor calling, saying I'd been missing for \r\nhours. And -- ",
        "Kevin: And? ",
        "Abe: Well, ever since then, I've been feeling so strange, like -- like -- ",
        "Kevin: Like what? ",
        "Abe: I don't know. Like I -- I've been poisoned or something. You know, \r\nwhat's going on? Why do I feel this way? ",
        "Kevin: We don't know yet, abe, but we'll know more once we draw some blood \r\nand run some tests. Jill? ",
        "Abe: No blood. No blood. ",

        "Chris: I am through playing 20 questions with you. Now, how is that stiff \r\nconnected to my brother? ",
        "Sam: He's not a stiff. His name's Zach and he was like family to me. He was \r\nthere when I didn't have anybody. ",

        "Sam: You're all heart. ",
