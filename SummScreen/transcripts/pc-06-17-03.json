        "As Ian and Chris try to help Lucy, who's in anaphylactic shock from the blood transfusion, Rafe regains consciousness and struggles to understand what's happening. An emergency use of steroids stabilizes Lucy. An angry Rafe confronts Ian about his use of force to get him to the hospital. Defeated, Ian admits that the direct transfusion of slayer blood wasn't the miracle he had hoped for. When Lucy realizes that there's nothing more that can be done for her, Ian agrees to take her home to spend time with him and the girls. After ensuring that his head is clear enough to act, Rafe thanks Jamal and sets off to rescue Alison. While Olivia sleeps, a restless Caleb thinks back to the promises he made his father: to protect the ring with his life and to make his father proud. His thoughts turn to the day he gave Olivia the ring to protect her, and then later when she admitted that it was gone. Deeply regretting having failed his father, Caleb vows to set things right. Joshua responds to Alison's refusal to consummate their \"marriage\" by torturing her with darkness and the loud sounds of a ticking, clanging clock. He pretends not to notice anything out of the ordinary other than a blown fuse. Alison informs him that it won't work, but Joshua again asks her what time it is. Alison demands to know why he keeps asking her about the time. Influenced by the drug, she succumbs to the power of persuasion and asks him to stay with her. The lights come back on, and Alison agrees that it's time for them to be together. After Joshua sets the stage for romance, he is angry to find that Caleb is there and Alison is gone. Rafe carries Alison to safety with the promise that everything will be all right. Still under the influence of the drug, she agrees with everything he says."
