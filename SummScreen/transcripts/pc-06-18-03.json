        "Christina and Serena give their mom a very happy homecoming, complete with a pajama party, but Lucy's heart breaks as she realizes that she won't be around for important moments in her daughters' lives. After the girls go to bed, Ian comforts Lucy as she cries about the lost future with her daughters. Seeing no other solution, Ian tells her that she can always be with them if she becomes a vampire. With Karen's professional--and personal--help, Kevin fights his way through a rough patch of his recovery. He complains bitterly about the way Lucy walked out on him as soon as things got tough. He's managed to turn everyone against him, and he has nothing left to live for, but Karen insists that she considers him worth saving. Kevin lays his head in her lap as she dabs a wet compress on his head. After rescuing Alison from Joshua's lecherous clutches, Rafe takes her to the barn, where he thinks she'll be safe. Alison assures him that Joshua would never hurt her. She accuses Rafe of abandoning her at Joshua's place because he no longer loves her. Stunned, Rafe tries to explain why her rescue didn't go as planned. He's curious about why she keeps looking at her watch, but she really doesn't know why she feels it's important. Rafe reminds her of the love they share, and he promises to keep her safe from Joshua. Looking into his eyes, Alison remembers. She tells him that she's right where she belongs; she loves him and always will. They share a sweet kiss. Immediately, she begins to shiver, but she doesn't know why. Rafe assumes that she's tired and hungry, and he asks what time it is. The question triggers the brainwashing. When Rafe goes to the car for supplies, Alison takes off. Caleb is amused by Joshua's failure to get his new bride into bed. Joshua accuses him of taking her, but Caleb convinces him that it was the slayer who rescued her. He insults Joshua about his many inadequacies, including a pitiful lunge that Caleb's thousand-year-old grandmother could beat. Joshua in turn taunts Caleb about his failure to protect the ring and therefore his heritage. Not to be outdone, Caleb ridicules him for his inability to make a woman fall in love with him. He further points out that Joshua is incapable of leadership. He challenges him to remove the ring and find out whether his loyal subjects still feel the same way about him. As Joshua stares at the ring and contemplates what to do, Alison returns. Absolutely stunned, Caleb asks what she's doing there, and she replies that it was time to come home."

        "Lucy: Did he say you could stay up? He said that? Really?",
        "Serena: Yes, he did. We've missed you so much.",
        "Lucy: Oh, I missed you so much, so, so very much.",
        "Serena: Guess what else Ian said. He said that we could have our very own pajama party right down here.",
        "Lucy: Oh, Ian said -- Ian said a pajama party?",
        "Ian: For a little while -- for a short while, and then you need to get some rest.",
        "Serena: We have your pajamas all ready.",
        "Christina: I'll go get them.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Oops -- thanks, pumpkin head. Appreciate that. Come here, you. Look at you. You are so beautiful, and your sister -- I think she grew an inch just while I was gone.",
        "Serena: Oh, don't forget we had to postpone Christina's birthday party, so we have to start working on the party.",
        "Lucy: Right. We need -- we need to make the party very, very, very special.",
        "Serena: You'll be all well by then, won't you, mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: God, make this stop. Just make this stop.",
        "Karen: It will, Kevin. It will stop. You're just going through a rough patch right now. I know it's not easy, but you can do this. Just hang in there and it'll soon be over. And then you'll be free -- free of this drug, free of Joshua's control.",
        "Kevin: It's hard to imagine ever feeling good again.",
        "Karen: But you will.",
        "Kevin: Or die trying.",
        "Karen: You're not even close to dying. Do you hear me? You can get through this.",
        "Kevin: What makes you so sure?",
        "Karen: Because I'm going to be right here to make sure you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe, why are we at the barn?",
        "Rafe: I figured Joshua doesn't know about it. And we could stay here and hide out, plan our next move. You know, and besides, it's our place, you know? I figured you'd feel safe here. I've been thinking a lot about it. I was here, actually, and I was thinking about all the time we spent here. It's really -- it's really some of the best times we ever spent together, and I want to get that back. You know, I want to -- I want to start over.",
        "Alison: Start over?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. You ok? He didn't hurt you?",
        "Alison: No. I just -- I got really scared when the lights went out.",
        "Rafe: So he -- he didn't -- touch you and --",
        "Alison: No, no, no. I -- no, not in a bad way, not at all.",
        "Rafe: I'm just glad he didn't hurt you.",
        "Alison: No, he would never do that. He treated me very well.",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Alison: He took care of me. No, but you -- you just left me there.",
        "Rafe: Wait a minute. You know that's not what I wanted to do --",
        "Alison: Why didn't you come back for me, Rafe? You said you would come back for me.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Alison: Is it because you don't love me anymore? Is that why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Oh. Looks like you had quite a little evening planned. The bridal suite looks lovely. Just one thing missing -- where's the bride?",
        "Joshua: What's the point in making Alison disappear?",
        "Caleb: Well, I hate to disappoint you, but Alison was gone when I got here.",
        "Joshua: I don't believe you. She was here. I turn around, I turn back, and then she's gone.",
        "Caleb: The slayer works fast.",
        "Joshua: The slayer.",
        "Caleb: What a shame. You know, here you are, finally got the girl that you want, you're about to close the deal, and -- bam! -- no chiquita.",
        "Joshua: She would not go back to him.",
        "Caleb: You know, I -- I don't know what you think, but from where I'm standing, this little empire that you've created for yourself -- it doesn't seem to be going so well.",
        "Joshua: Get out.",
        "Caleb: You can't be me, not even close.",
        "Joshua: Do you think that's what I want?",
        "Caleb: It's kind of been an obsession of yours since the day you came to work for me -- to live my life. But the fact is you just can't pull it off.",
        "Joshua: I said get out!",
        "Caleb: You got a lot of work to do on that lunge, Joshua. My 1,000-year-old grandmother's faster than you.",
        "Joshua: You can flaunt your tricks, but you cannot win. Not as long as I have this ring.",
        "Caleb: A ring that is my legacy, Joshua.",
        "Joshua: No, correction, your father's legacy. A legacy you promised to protect with your life. Well, obviously, you failed at that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Even with the ring and all the power that it has, you still can't get what you want.",
        "Joshua: I've done pretty well so far. Let's see -- I have your kingdom and I also have the slayer's girl.",
        "Caleb: Oh, I think we both know it takes a lot more than a piece of jewelry to make a good leader -- or get a woman to want you.",
        "Joshua: Alison will come back to me, I can assure you.",
        "Caleb: I'm surprised -- you actually believe that, right? That a girl like Alison will want some old fool like yourself.",
        "Joshua: Shut up! You shut up or else I'm going to kill you!",
        "Caleb: Oh. Sorry, did I hit a nerve? Seriously, Josh, how many times have you had this girl right where you want her, only to have her go running back to the slayer? You know, if I were you -- and I thank the Gods below that I'm not -- I'd be starting to lose confidence by now.",
        "Joshua: Alison will come back to me. She will come back.",
        "Caleb: But there's only one thing that will make you feel truly worthy, and that's knowing that you've won someone's love, something that you haven't been able to do so far. And it's obvious you never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: How can you say you think I don't love you? I mean, I tried like hell to get to you. It's just Ian stopped me, and then Lucy needed some kind of transfusion or something and -- what's going on? Why do you keep looking at that watch?",
        "Alison: No, I -- I just feel like it should be really important for some reason",
        "Rafe: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: I don't know. It's just supposed to be really important. That's all I know. That's all I can tell you. What is that?",
        "Rafe: Come here. Just -- just trust me when I say it's over. Ok, this whole thing with Joshua? He can't hurt you anymore. Ok, do you understand that?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, Joshua is gone.",
        "Rafe: Right, right. And now it's just you and me, and we're here in our place.",
        "Alison: Our place?",
        "Rafe: You remember. Come on, this barn, it's the place where we first made love and -- here, come here. See that? We made that carving afterwards.",
        "Alison: Wait.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Come here. Come here, right over here. Standing right here -- this is where we made vows to each other that we would love each other forever. We would be there for each other always.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Rafe: I came back to life because of you. And I'm here because of you. Because of your love for me and my love for you -- that's why I'm back, that's why I got a second chance, right? It's because of our love for each other that we are able to overcome any bad thing that ever happened to us. It will again. It always will. Tell me you believe me. Tell me that you know how much I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Serena: All right, is that better?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, thanks. I must've had a little chill.",
        "Ian: I'll get those marshmallows.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Christina: This is fun. Could we have a pajama party every night?",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. I don't know if we should have one every single night. Do you think? Wow.",
        "Serena: Hey, mom, you know what I was thinking?",
        "Lucy: What? What were you thinking?",
        "Serena: That maybe when I get back into school I could invite all my friends over for a real slumber party.",
        "Lucy: When you get back in school -- you know, that's a -- that's a long, long time off. I have a better idea. Why don't we have a sleepover party, like, right -- right now. I could do food and invitations and help you, at least.",
        "Serena: No, no, no, no, no. All my friends are going to camp and vacations and stuff.",
        "Lucy: Right, I forgot.",
        "Serena: Besides, I really want to have it after the dance.",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Do you mean your first boy-girl -- I mean, like a real, live boy-girl dance?",
        "Serena: It's going to be so cool. They're going to have this totally hot D.J., And you have to help me decide what my outfit's going to be. You have to.",
        "Lucy: Oh, pumpkin. My pumpkin head.",
        "Serena: It's ok, mom. It's not that big of a deal. You don't have to cry.",
        "Lucy: I know, but it's a very big deal to me because look at you. You're growing up. You're going to have so many wonderful things happen to you, so many new things that are so amazing, and I just -- I'm --",
        "Serena: What, mom?",
        "Lucy: I just want to be there. I want to be there to answer all your questions and to share all those moments with you.",
        "Serena: You will be, mom. Christina and I, we're not going anywhere, are we?",
        "Christina: Right! We're a family!",
        "Lucy: Right! We're a family.",
        "Ian: All right. I've got marshmallows and these cracker things. What am I missing?",
        "Lucy and Serena: Chocolate!",
        "Christina: Chocolate!",
        "Serena: Only the most important part!",
        "Lucy: Please.",
        "Ian: I don't know.",
        "Serena: Oh, come on, we got to go get it for him. Come on.",
        "Lucy: .. Hurry right back.",
        "Serena: Come on, we got to go get the chocolate.",
        "Ian: Ahem.",
        "Lucy: I can't do this. How am I supposed to do this? How am I supposed to leave them? How am I going to leave my babies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: You can do this, Kevin. I know you. You're strong enough to beat this.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, for what? So I can get my miserable life back?",
        "Karen: What are you talking about?",
        "Kevin: It's too late for me, Karen. I've hurt everyone I love.",
        "Karen: No, you haven't.",
        "Kevin: I have, too. I even -- I was even willing to hurt my own daughter.",
        "Karen: That was a drug, Kevin, Joshua's hold over you. And even then, you couldn't go through with it.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, I took the drug, though, didn't I? I made that choice.",
        "Karen: Ok, Kevin, you know what? Stop being so hard on yourself. You're not the only one who's made bad choices, done things they've regretted.",
        "Kevin: Yeah -- Lucy.",
        "Karen: And I know the pain of losing someone you love, someone you thought would always be there.",
        "Kevin: She was supposed to be the love of my life. When the going got tough, she just walked.",
        "Karen: You know, sometimes we expect too much.",
        "Kevin: Hmm.",
        "Karen: We think just because we fall in love with somebody, that they're infallible, that they'll never disappoint us. But they're human, too. They make mistakes, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Well, you know what I think? I think being human is overrated.",
        "Karen: Don't say that.",
        "Kevin: Well, that was the best thing about that damn drug -- I never had to worry about being human. I didn't have to worry about a thing. The drug did it all for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison, look at me. Say something, say anything. Just please, please, just come back to me, ok?",
        "Alison: I'm here.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: I'm right in front of you, where I belong. I'm with you.",
        "Rafe: Oh, thank God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: You have no right to talk to me in this way. I am your superior.",
        "Caleb: You're no one's superior, Joshua, least of all a vampire's. And how can you be when you know so little about us?",
        "Joshua: I know more than you think. After all, didn't I learn from the best?",
        "Caleb: All that time by my side and you didn't learn how to lead.",
        "Joshua: You're wrong. I'm a good leader. My subjects respect me.",
        "Caleb: They respect the ring on your finger and it's power to protect. Nothing else.",
        "Joshua: No, it's not just about the ring.",
        "Caleb: Oh, yeah? Then prove it. Take it off. It's not doing you any good anyway. You can't be what I am.",
        "Joshua: I can learn.",
        "Caleb: Nah. you don't learn that, you have it in you. And you don't have it in you. You don't know how to lead. That's why you're all alone here. That's why the slayer has Alison, and you're left with no one. No one at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I'll never let you go. Not ever again.",
        "Alison: Thank God you came back for me. I love you and I always will.",
        "Rafe: Come here, come here. Are you ok? You're shivering.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I have no idea what's just come over me.",
        "Rafe: You know, you've been through a lot. You're probably hungry and tired.",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Rafe: You need to eat and get some rest.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I think I'm just really tired.",
        "Rafe: It must be late. What time is it?",
        "Joshua's voice echoes: What time is it, Alison? What is the time now? What is the time now, Alison? Right now? What time is it, Alison? What time is it, Alison?",
        "Rafe: Just stay here. I have some blankets. I think I have some trail mix in the car, ok, so I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: You're going to be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I can't do this. I -- I don't have anything left.",
        "Karen: Yes, you do, Kevin, you have me.",
        "Kevin: You?",
        "Karen: Look me in the eyes and know you're not alone. That there's someone that knows you're worth saving. That you could be the man you once were -- that kind, gentle, brilliant, funny, amazing man.",
        "Kevin: You're beautiful, lovely. I want to hold you, touch you. Oh, don't leave. Just don't go anywhere.",
        "Karen: I'm not going anywhere. Come here, Kevin. Sit down. Lie down.",
        "Kevin: Hot. I'm so hot.",
        "Karen: Ok.",
        "Kevin: I'm burning up.",
        "Karen: Ok, I'll get you some cold water. I'll be right back.",
        "Karen: Ok, Kevin. Here. Here, lie down. Lie down on me. Just lie down. There.",
        "Kevin: Oh, that feels good. That feels good.",
        "Karen: Shh. Just relax, ok? Just relax.",

        "Lucy: Did the girls finally go to sleep?",
        "Ian: They're out.",
        "Lucy: Good. I guess we kept them up really late, didn't we? I mean --",
        "Ian: Nah.",
        "Lucy: I didn't exactly have the heart to tell them they had to go to sleep. You know -- I mean, now that I know -- well, you know what I'm saying, now that I know that every minute is precious.",
        "Ian: I'm -- I --",
        "Lucy: I -- I have no idea how to do this. I don't know how to say goodbye to them or leave them. I do not know how to leave them without their mommy. I mean, I -- you know Christina. She's got to have me tuck her in, you know, that certain way. If I don't put the pillow -- and when she's sick and her little cheeks get so red and the hot, I have -- she still thinks there's monsters under her bed, so who is going to chase those monsters out when she calls out \"mommy!\" in the night? God, did you see Serena? She's beautiful, isn't she? So what am I supposed to think when I can't be there to tell her, \"it's ok, your heart is not going to break like a piece of glass, you'll get over your first crush\"? And who's going to tell her how pretty she looks, pick out her first dress for that dance? I'm not going to be there, am I? Not ever. I never, ever will be there for them! I -- I won't!",
        "[Lucy cries]",
        "Ian: There is a way, you know. There is a way you can always be with them.",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, there's -- what are you talking about, there's a way? What do you mean?",
        "Ian: I can turn you. I can make you one of us.",

        "Caleb: Let it go, Joshua. Just give me the ring. Forget about a dream that's never going to come true. You and Alison's never going to happen. She's never going to want you.",

        "Caleb: Alison, what are you doing here?",
