        "Lucy is shocked by Ian's idea to turn her into a vampire, but he explains that it would be a temporary measure to buy her some time. It would allow her to be with him and the girls until he could find a cure for the curse. Lucy tells him that she simply can't do something like that. Unlike him, she has a choice, and she doesn't want to watch her children and all their descendents grow old and die. Being a parent himself, Ian understands her position. Lucy decides to fill her last days with wonderful memories for Ian. Caleb is stunned to see Alison, who states that it was time for her to leave Rafe and return home to Joshua. Caleb accuses Joshua of using drugs to control her. Joshua admits to having been ready to throw in the towel and return the ring until his bride came home to him. Now that she's home, he will never relinquish possession of the ring. Caleb is confident that it won't take long to beat his sworn enemy. He tracks Rafe down at the barn and fills him in on what happened, but the slayer doesn't believe him. Caleb wants to prove that he's telling the truth by going back for both Alison and his ring. Meanwhile, Alison submissively waits for Joshua to tell her how to please him. Joshua tells her to go back to Rafe, but with specific instructions. He intends to set her watch so that the alarm will go off at various times. When she hears the sound, she is to use whatever means necessary to reassure Rafe of her love. He whispers one last command in her ear before letting her go. Back at the barn, Caleb urges Rafe to head out with him now. His plan is thwarted when Alison returns. Although she lies about where she's been, Rafe believes every word she says."

        "Lucy: Did I -- I just hear what I thought I heard? That you -- you want to make me a vampire.",
        "Ian: I -- no, I don't want to make you a vampire. I don't, no. I don't wish that life on anyone, especially you.",
        "Lucy: But you --",
        "Ian: But I don't know what else to do. And I would give you my life in a second, you know that, but it wouldn't change anything.",
        "Lucy: I know you would. But I -- a -- a vampire?",
        "Ian: Look at me. It would give us time. It would give us time to cure this, to find another one of those springs or -- or some kind of ancient ritual, something. It might take a hundred years, but I would find a cure. I promise you I would find something because that is the only way that I can save you, the only way that I can save the best part of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison! Alison? Oh, come on, where are you? Where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: What are you doing?",
        "Alison: It was time for me to leave Rafe and come home to Joshua. It was time.",
        "Joshua: What was that you were saying, Stephen, about Alison not wanting me?",
        "Caleb: You don't know what you're saying. I know you don't.",
        "Alison: No, this is what I want. I want to be home with Joshua. I did the right thing by coming home, didn't I?",
        "Joshua: If this is what you want, my sweetheart, then you did the right thing.",
        "Alison: There's nowhere else I could go.",
        "Caleb: What'd you do to her?",
        "Joshua: \"Do\" to her?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. To get her to come back.",
        "Joshua: Well, what can I tell you, my boy. It -- it must be love.",
        "Caleb: Drugs. You were always good with chemicals.",
        "Joshua: I had a lot of time on my hands when I was working for you. And, oh, yes -- this is still what you want, isn't it?",
        "Caleb: You know it is.",
        "Joshua: And I know this is killing you. The mighty Caleb Morley has underestimated me yet again. But I have to give you credit -- that little mind game of yours -- it almost worked. I almost didn't feel worthy to wear the precious Morley ring. But thankfully my wife showed up. Ah, the power of love. But the ring will stay right where it is. Right where it belongs.",
        "Caleb: That ring will never be yours. It belongs to my family.",
        "Joshua: It once did. Now it belongs to me. And I've actually grown rather attached to it -- much as I have to other things. So, if you will excuse us, please. We'd like some privacy.",
        "Caleb: You're right, Josh. I did underestimate you. I thought it'd only take a few weeks to bring you down. Looks like it's going to take a few more days after all.",
        "Joshua: I wouldn't be so sure about that.",
        "Caleb: Oh, you're going down.",
        "Joshua: Not by you. Not as long as I have this on my finger.",
        "Caleb: We'll see about that.",
        "Joshua: Call ahead next time, won't you? We are newlyweds after all. Oh, my darling. I was so worried about you. I wasn't sure whether you'd ever come back.",
        "Alison: I couldn't stay away.",
        "Joshua: It was time, wasn't it?",
        "Alison: Yes, it was time. Well, now that I'm back here, what would you like me to do for you?",
        "Joshua: Hmm. That's a very good question. What am I going to do with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Come on. I just left her here for a minute. Where the hell is she? Alison, come on.",
        "Caleb: You know, this carelessness of yours is starting to become a problem.",
        "Rafe: You.",
        "Caleb: I thought you might be here.",
        "Rafe: Ok, where is she? What the hell did you do to her this time, huh?",
        "Caleb: Easy, easy.",
        "Rafe: I said where is she?",
        "Caleb: Where is she? She's with her husband, Joshua.",
        "Rafe: No, that can't be. I got her out of there.",
        "Caleb: Not exactly.",
        "Rafe: What do you mean, \"not exactly\"? I -- I mean, I only left her alone for a minute. He couldn't have taken her.",
        "Caleb: No, I never said that he did.",
        "Rafe: Well, what are you saying?",
        "Caleb: Joshua didn't have to take her. She waltzed right back into his arms like there was nowhere else in the world she'd rather be. You -- you're in trouble, pal, and so is Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: You want to know what you can do for me?",
        "Alison: Yes, I want to please you if I can.",
        "Joshua: I can think of a million things you could do, but why don't you pour me a drink? I'd like to celebrate your homecoming.",
        "Alison: Yes, of course. Would you like brandy or wine?",
        "Joshua: Why don't you surprise me? I trust you enjoyed your visit with Rafe.",
        "Alison: Yes. I did. Here's your merlot. I hope you like it.",
        "Joshua: I'm sure I will. Won't you join me?",
        "Alison: No. I already feel intoxicated.",
        "Joshua: As do I, by your beauty. Here's to you, my darling. Welcome home.",
        "Alison: Thank you. It's good to be home.",
        "Joshua: You really mean that, don't you?",
        "Alison: Yes, I do.",
        "Joshua: I'm very proud of you. You've done much better than even I hoped.",
        "Alison: Have I?",
        "Joshua: Yes. You've proven yourself worthy -- worthy of my love, worthy of my name. Worthy of sharing my empire. But now, my darling, there's just one final test.",
        "Alison: Test? What test?",
        "Joshua: You've heard the saying \"if you love something, set it free\"?",
        "Alison: \"And if it comes back to you, it's yours.\"",
        "Joshua: \"And if it doesn't --\"",
        "Alison: \"It never was.\"",
        "Joshua: I know it's a ridiculous expression, but -- well, part of me believes that it's true. I want to put you, my darling, to the test.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Joshua: Very simply, my dear. You see, I've decided to let you go back to Rafe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Don't you see? If you were what I am, you could go on living until we find a cure.",
        "Lucy: Go on living?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: So that means I would get to stay with you, and I wouldn't have to leave my girls. I would get to keep on being their mom.",
        "Ian: One bite. It's all it takes, just one bite.",
        "Lucy: Right, and I would -- oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Ian: Not for always. No, look at me. Just for a little while, you know, until we find a cure. And then we'd be back to normal.",
        "Lucy: How long would that be? I mean, how long before we'd be back? How long?",
        "Ian: I don't know. But the important thing is you'd be alive and you'd be a mother to your children and --",
        "Lucy: I'd be with you. But what do you think? What kind of person would I be? You know, what kind of mother would I be if I was a vampire?",
        "Ian: You'd be the same wonderful mother you are now.",
        "Lucy: We don't know that.",
        "Ian: No, we don't know that, but what's the alternative?",
        "Lucy: I know. I know. The thought of leaving you and leaving my girls is killing me, but I -- I don't think I can do that. I can't doom those sweet little faces to that world of darkness, that cursed world of shadows. I couldn't do that.",
        "Ian: Only until we find a cure. You got to -- you know.",
        "Lucy: What if there isn't? What if there isn't really a cure?",
        "Ian: Well, of course there is. And there has to be, right? There has to be something.",
        "Lucy: But what if there's not? If there's not a cure, that means I would be a vampire forever, so I would watch my children die, right? They would just grow old. And their children and their children would just die, and I would go on and on without them. I bet it would be the worst part. I couldn't do that.",
        "Ian: That is the worst part.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry --",
        "Ian: No, no, no. No.",
        "Lucy: No, I'm going on and on about me. I'm so --",
        "Ian: Shh. I think about it every day. What kind of a dad I've become to my boy, every day.",
        "Lucy: Then what do you do? How are you doing this? How are you -- how are you dealing with this at all?",
        "Ian: It's one day at a time. It's all I can do.",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm just so sorry that this is what you got. I'm sorry that you didn't have a choice and you didn't have a say in what happened to you. You didn't get to choose, and -- I can, though, right? I mean, I -- this is my choice, and I can say what happens, and I just -- I can't do it. I can't choose that. I can't do it.",
        "Ian: I know, I know.",
        "Lucy: But do you hear what I'm saying to you? I'm actually telling you that I would rather die than live your life.",
        "Ian: It's all right, you know?",
        "Lucy: It's not -- it's not ok. I hate this. I hate that I can't do this. I can't choose that. I hate it. I would do almost anything not to leave you or those girls, but I can't live in the world if I know my children have to live in some vampire world. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I --",
        "Ian: What are you sorry for? I wish I had your courage. I -- just a last -- last resort. I was trying to -- grabbing at straws, you know. It's the Irish way. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: No. No, no.",
        "Ian: It was me being selfish, because all I want is to spend more time with you.",
        "Lucy: You're not selfish. You're not selfish to me. I know what you were doing. You were trying to give me hope. And you were trying to show me a way that I could go on, that I wouldn't have to leave my babies. And I love you. I love you more than you will ever know. But we have to face this -- I do not have any more hope. There's no hope, not, at least, for me.",
        "Ian: I'm -- I --",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. Please. You have to promise me something. You have got to promise me that after I'm gone -- listen to me. You have to promise that you will not give up and you will not let those -- that you won't let them win, ok?",
        "Ian: How can I promise you that if I can't even imagine a life without you?",
        "Lucy: You have to. Say the words. I want you to say it to me. You promise me you will not let them win.",
        "Ian: Yeah, I promise.",
        "Lucy: No, no, stop. Promise me! Say it! Say it.",
        "Ian: I promise that I will not let them win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You're lying.",
        "Caleb: Give me a reason.",
        "Rafe: Because you're Caleb Morley, and lying is as natural to you as breathing.",
        "Caleb: Like denial is to you?",
        "Rafe: Ok, so what are you telling me? You're telling me Alison walked right in -- she walked right in, right there, in front of --",
        "Caleb: Right into his arms.",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, and you just happened to be there?",
        "Caleb: I was trying to get the ring back.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. Of course, the ring.",
        "Caleb: Yep. With Alison gone, I had a shot. Joshua was so blown away that she had left him. He was ready to lie down and die. Then she comes waltzing back in and blows it for me. As far as I know, she's still down there.",
        "Rafe: I mean, what happened? Did Alison get a hold of the ring and you're keeping her hostage till she tells you where it is, huh?",
        "Caleb: If Alison had my ring, and I had Alison, would I be down here wasting my time with you?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I don't presume to know what goes on in that twisted mind of yours.",
        "Caleb: I'm trying to tell you what happened so maybe we can go down and do something about it.",
        "Rafe: Yeah? Then why would you want to do that, huh? I mean, why are you suddenly being so helpful?",
        "Caleb: For the same reason we started working together in the first place.",
        "Rafe: Right, right. Because you want the ring, right? You get the ring, and I get Alison. Well guess what -- I already had her, all right? She was here! She was right here. I had her in my arms, and she didn't want anything to do with that monster. She wouldn't go back there.",
        "Caleb: Obviously, she changed her mind.",
        "Rafe: No. This is stupid. I can't even believe that I'm sitting here listening to you. Alison wouldn't choose Joshua over me, ok?",
        "Caleb: Look at yourself. Your ego is so out of check you can't see the truth even when it hits you right in the face.",
        "Rafe: What -- what truth? What truth is that, huh?",
        "Caleb: What truth? Alison going back to Joshua has nothing to do with you. He's done something to her -- drugged her or brainwashed her or hypnotized her, something to get her under his control.",
        "Rafe: She just -- she was out of it, but she was coming back. She was coming back. She said she wanted to be here. She said she loved me.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, and you know what she said to him? She said it was time for her to come back home.",
        "Rafe: No.",
        "Caleb: No? Look, I tell you what -- if I'm lying, we'll go down there and she won't be there, all right? And if she is, I'll help you get her back again.",
        "Rafe: As long as I help you get the ring, right?",
        "Caleb: You have your agenda, I have mine. So what do you say? You want to stand around here arguing some more? Let's go take back what's ours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I don't believe it. You're really letting me go back to Rafe?",
        "Joshua: Yes, I am.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Joshua: Oh, I don't know. Let's call it a kind of closure.",
        "Alison: Closure?",
        "Joshua: Well, yes. Much as it hurts me, I know how much you care about the boy, and I'm sure he's probably hurting pretty much right about know. He's probably wondering what happened to you, wondering where you are.",
        "Alison: Yes, I'm sure he is.",
        "Joshua: Well, that's why you must go to him.",
        "Alison: I don't understand.",
        "Joshua: You must reassure him that you're safe. Reassure him in any way that you can -- with your words and your kisses. Do whatever it takes.",
        "Alison: You mean --",
        "Joshua: Yes. Don't hold anything back.",
        "Alison: I mean, how do I do that? I'm not sure that I know what to do anymore.",
        "Joshua: I will help you. I'll help you every step of the way.",
        "Alison: Help me, how?",
        "Joshua: I'm going to set your watch, and every time the alarm goes off, it's time for you to tell Rafe that you love him.",
        "Alison: You won't be angry with me?",
        "Joshua: What did I just say? If you love something, you must set it free.",
        "Alison: I don't know how to ever thank you for giving me time with Rafe like this.",
        "Joshua: The best way to thank me is just to keep this little arrangement strictly between ourselves.",
        "Alison: You don't want me to tell him?",
        "Joshua: No, Rafe would never understand. I mean, at the very least, it would complicate things. Also, the last thing I want to do is cause any trouble between the two of you.",
        "Alison: You really do want what's best for me, don't you?",
        "Joshua: I want to do whatever it takes to make you happy. That's why I'm saving the best instruction for last.",
        "Alison: What is it?",
        "Joshua: When your alarm goes off for the last time, this is what I want you to do.",
        "Alison: Do you really think that I'll be able to do that?",
        "Joshua: I'm sure you will. In fact, I have no doubt in my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You sure you're not too cold out here?",
        "Lucy: No, thank you. I'm fine. I just -- I really needed to be outside, get some fresh air. The sun's already up. Start of a new day. Whole new beginning.",
        "Lucy: That's what it was like, you know, falling in love with you. It was like a whole new beginning for me, like a whole new chance at being happy.",
        "Ian: It was for me, too.",
        "Lucy: You know, this doesn't have to be exactly like this. You know, I mean, we -- we may not have a lot of time together, but I think what we need to do is make every minute we have together count, right? I mean, starting today, I want -- I want to make wonderful, amazing memories for you. That's what I want to leave you with. I don't want to leave you with sadness. No tears. I want to make you happy. Just happiness, ok? Can we do that starting today? Can we -- can we do that?",
        "Ian: Of course we can. I'll do anything you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison's voice: This is what I want. I want to be home with Joshua. I did the right thing by coming home, didn't I?",
        "Joshua's voice: If this is what you want, my sweetheart, then you did the right thing.",
        "Alison's voice: There's nowhere else I could go.",
        "Joshua: Alison.",
        "Caleb: Sun's up. Man, if we're going to make a move, we should do it now.",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine. I'll go with you, but if this turns out to be some kind of trick --",
        "Caleb: No tricks. Joshua and Alison are together. You'll see for yourself.",
        "Alison: Did I hear someone mention my name?",
        "Rafe: You're here. You're back.",
        "Alison: Yes, of course I'm back. I'm sorry, I just went out to get these.",
        "Rafe: Flowers?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I just thought maybe if we were going to be here for a while, that -- might want to make the place look a little bit homier.",
        "Caleb: I think I'm going to be sick.",
        "Rafe: So that's -- that's where you were this whole time?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Fine. You weren't with Joshua?",
        "Alison: Joshua? No. Why would you think that I would leave you to go back to Joshua? Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Desire\"--",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Ricky: I thought I could push you to sleep with me.",
        "Casey: Even though you knew that it would mean I'd get sent back up forever?",
        "Ricky: That was the point.",
        "Caleb: You were there.",
        "Rafe: Are you deaf? She said she was nowhere near Joshua.",
        "Caleb: She's lying, and you're a fool if you believe her."
