        "Alison: You know, I just can't get over it. The coffin, the dug-up grave -- I \r\nmean, it's all just -- it's -- ",
        "Jamal: Unbelievable. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I was blown away before just having Jack back with us -- I \r\nmean, walking and talking. ",
        "Jamal: Breathing and -- ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, it's pretty amazing. That's all. ",
        "Alison: How do you suppose that the coffin got all torn up like that? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, Jack, you still haven't told us how you just got out. ",
        "Livvie: It's a miracle. That's why. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. I'll give you that. It sure was, but I'd still like to \r\nknow how Jack pulled it off because last time I checked, he wasn't a miracle \r\nworker or anything. ",
        "Jack: Come on, guys. Would you just give it a rest? ",
        "Jamal: \"Give it a rest,\" Jack? Yesterday we woke up believing you were dead, \r\ndude. We put you in the ground. We buried you. And now you show up today alive \r\nwith barely a scratch on you, and you expect us to just make like nothing ever \r\nhappened? Nah, nah, I don't think so. Not until you give us a good enough \r\nexplanation of what happened out there. ",

        "Ian: You all right? ",
        "Eve: Yes. I'm ok. Even under the best circumstances, divorce is -- ",
        "Ian: It's never easy. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, Kevin and I -- we want to move on with our \r\nlives. And I love you. ",
        "Ian: And I love you. So what do you say, tonight, just the two of us, quiet \r\nevening? ",
        "Eve: Well, I think that sounds really wonderful -- ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: But it's the Nurses Ball. ",
        "Ian: That's tonight? ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. And we both have to get ready. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, right. Yeah, we -- we should. Great. ",
        "Eve: You don't want to go to this thing, do you? ",
        "Ian: No, no, I'd love to go. Great. ",
        "Eve: Come on. Ian, I know how much you hate these things. ",
        "Ian: I want to go. ",
        "Eve: Well, you know, I was just thinking -- I mean, thanks to this little \r\nbundle of joy that we have going on here, I probably will not even fit into my \r\nNurses Ball dress! ",
        "Ian: No, no, no. I think you're going to look great in that dress. We're \r\ngoing. That's the end of it. ",
        "Eve: Are you sure? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. It's our first appearance as an officially engaged couple. ",
        "Eve: Ok. All right. Then I'll just go try and fit into my Nurses Ball dress.\r\n",

        "Gabriela: I don't think I can sing tonight. I woke up this morning, and my \r\nvoice -- it's all hoarse and scratchy. Do I sound hoarse to you? ",
        "Alex: No. ",
        "Colleen: You sound like you always sound. ",
        "Joe: Are you still trying to fake a sore throat? ",

        "Gabriela: Joe, I don't think I can go on tonight. ",
        "Joe: Will you stop already? You're going to be great. ",
        "Colleen: Good luck convincing her. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm know I'm being a bit silly, but I'm really nervous. ",
        "Joe: Sweetheart, it's the Nurses Ball, not Carnegie Hall. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I'm not just nervous about that. ",
        "Joe: It won't be long now. We'll hear something by the end of the day, and \r\nthen -- ",
        "Gabriela: And then that's it. It's your final HIV test. ",

        "Kevin: I was, I was -- Lucy -- something happened. ",
        "Lucy: What -- oh. Doc, I'm so sorry. I forgot. You picked up your divorce \r\npapers this morning. I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm sorry. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- right. ",
        "Lucy: Are -- well, are you ok with that? ",
        "Kevin: I'm ok. Eve's ok. It's what we wanted. That's not it. It's just -- ",
        "Lucy: It's just what, what? ",
        "Kevin: There was a water main that burst, and there's a -- not a pretty -- a \r\nvery serious flood at the hotel. ",
        "Lucy: The Versailles Room? ",
        "Kevin: Completely underwater. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. ",

        "Eve: Ok. You know what? Tell me the truth, ok? You won't hurt my feelings, I \r\npromise. ",
        "Ian: The truth is I really want to take you to this party. Really do. So I'm \r\ngoing to take a shower. ",
        "Eve: Well, wait a minute. Wait -- no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You just hang \r\nout, relax, and finish your beer because I still have to do my hair, so we got \r\nplenty of time. ",
        "Ian: You sure? ",

        "Kevin: Lucy, relax. ",
        "Lucy: I want to give them the money! ",
        "Kevin: Relax. Lucy, breathe deep. That's it. Keep -- keep fanning, Don. All \r\nright, Lucy, listen to me. We're going to focus. We're going to concentrate. \r\nWe're going to figure this out, and everything is going to be fine. ",
        "Lucy: \"Fine.\" \"Fine?\" ",
        "Kevin: Fine. ",
        "Lucy: How can everything be fine when everything is under three feet of \r\nwater? ",
        "Kevin: Five, actually. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God! ",
        "Don: There must be something we can do. ",
        "Lucy: Some-- what do you suggest, Don? What do we do, buy everybody little \r\nbikini trunks and give them swim caps and plop them down in some sort of \r\npaddleboat and they watch a water ballet? I don't think so. ",
        "Kevin: That's not a bad idea. ",

        "Joe: Maybe you could find another place. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, thanks, Joe. That's kind of like saying, \"Maybe Al Gore will be \r\nhappy being a little college professor at some podunk university.\" ",
        "Gabriela: I know how hard you worked, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Gabby, thanks. It's not me. It's not me. It's everybody. It's all \r\nof you. We come together for this one cause one time a year, and it's so \r\nimportant to everybody. We do something positive for the universe. How in the \r\nworld am I going to go tell everybody, \"I'm sorry, it's all for nothing?\" ",
        "Kevin: Then you won't. Lucy, the show will go on. ",
        "Don: Darn right it will. ",

        "Gabriela: Absolutely. ",

        "Chris: Garcia, I'm telling you, this isn't the end of the story. Yeah, I know \r\nJack's alive, but I still have a lot of questions. What -- yeah, fine. Take your \r\ncall. Take a coffee break. Go buy some doughnuts for all I care. I'll get the \r\nanswers myself. ",
        "",
        "Jack: I don't know what happened. All right, I have no memory of being in \r\nthat coffin, much less how I got out. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, so what do you remember? ",
        "Livvie: He told you. ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- all I remember before I saw Livvie was walking along that \r\nroad, in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where to go. And then I came upon \r\nthat river. ",
        "Jamal: And that's all? ",
        "Jack: Don't you think I would tell you, man? All I'm asking for is your help. \r\nI don't know what's going on with me. Believe me, I'm as freaked out about this \r\nwhole thing as you are. ",
        "Jamal: Look, all right. Look, sorry for going off on you and everything, but \r\nthere's just got to be some kind of explanation for all this. ",
        "Livvie: And you know what? Who cares how Jack got out of that coffin? He -- \r\nhe is here now, and he is back, and we are lucky. ",
        "Jack: No, no. All right? Jamal's right. There's too many unanswered questions \r\nhere. I mean, come on. How did I survive being buried alive? Huh? And how I got \r\nout -- you saw that box. Looked like some bomb blew it up. And how could you \r\nguys stick me in the ground when I'm not even dead? It doesn't make any sense.\r\n",
        "Alison: No, no, Jack, you have no idea how sorry we are about that. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I don't know how we could've been so wrong. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, you were there. You were the one that saw him take his last \r\nbreath. And you guys felt how cold he was when we buried him, too, and you guys \r\nwere sitting there all night long sitting next to his grave, crying, and there \r\nwere -- ",
        "Livvie: No, no, that's enough! Just drop it, ok? ",
        "Jamal: All right, fine, but we can't pretend like this didn't happen. Ok, we \r\ncan't pretend like that -- like the coffin ripped itself apart. ",
        "Alison: Well, ok, maybe an animal, like, picked up his scent or something. \r\nThat could happen, you know? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, Ali, then why didn't that same animal go and eat Jack after going \r\nthrough all that trouble? ",
        "Alison: I don't know, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Huh? ",
        "Alison: Ok, maybe at the last minute he decided he wanted a chicken or \r\nsomething. I don't know. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, that is the most idiotic thing -- ",
        "Livvie: Will you stop, both of you! I don't care how it happened. I just care \r\nthat Jack is back and he is here now. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, maybe you can dismiss the impossible, but I can't, ok? Sorry. ",
        "Jack: And neither can I. ",

        "Livvie: Why did you have to do that? ",
        "Alison: Livvie, he is just trying to figure out what is going on. ",
        "Jamal: We got to figure out what happened, ok, so we can help him. ",
        "Livvie: \"Help him?\" ",
