        "Deciding that some play time will do keep Kevin's mind off his problems, Karen tosses a baseball to him, but as they toss the ball back and forth, Kevin throws it through a glass window. After helping clean up the broken glass, Kevin gives her a long, slow kiss. Elizabeth happens to witness the kiss from outside before stalking off, her jealous suspicions confirmed. Afterward, Kevin admits to Karen that kissing her was a bad idea. Ricky tempts Casey with her favorite cinnamon rolls in an effort to persuade her to go to New York with him. When she refuses, Ricky loses his temper. Believing that he has her best interests at heart, Casey eventually gives in, but Ricky immediately feels the pangs of guilt. His confession leaves Casey temporarily speechless. When she does start talking, she really lays into him for wasting her time when there are so many deserving people who need help. Ricky tries to redeem himself by telling her how much he loves her, but Casey isn't falling for it. After informing him that she really did love him, the devastated guardian angel leaves his apartment. Caleb tries to get Alison to tell the truth, but she doesn't seem to know what he's talking about. Caleb thinks that Joshua is obviously behind whatever is going on. Rafe sides with Alison, and they insist that Caleb leave. Caleb warns Rafe to sleep with his eyes open. Rafe looks unconvinced as Alison tries to reassure him that she was telling the truth. He goes to the car to get the radio so that they can dance, and while he's gone, the alarm on Alison's watch goes off. When Rafe returns, Alison informs him that it's time to make love--right now. Olivia is puzzled to find that Caleb left during the night. When he comes home, he fills her in on what happened. Olivia wants to eliminate the problem by killing Alison, assuring him that she wouldn't enjoy doing it. Caleb is worried that Alison is Joshua's secret weapon, and he can't be certain whether Rafe is the target--or whether they are. When Olivia accuses him of caring more about Alison than he cares about her, Caleb orders her to give it a rest."

        "Karen: Oh?",
        "Kevin: Another endless span of physical and mental torture otherwise known as detox.",
        "Karen: Wrong again, doctor. No more sitting around feeling sorry for yourself. I got you out of that hospital because you were climbing the walls and since you're on your way to beating this thing, you owe me one. All right, look alive.",
        "Kevin: Like I said, another day of torture.",

        "Casey: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Ricky: Straight out of the oven.",
        "Casey: Your oven?",
        "Ricky: Well, I kind of heated them up.",
        "Casey: Mmm. mmm. mmm.",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Coffee. I need coffee.",
        "Ricky: In a minute, in a minute.",
        "Casey: Wait, wait -- what are you doing?",
        "Ricky: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh -- stop. Actually, you get all of this and more as soon as you tell me that you'll go to New York with me.",
        "Casey: Ricky -- Ricky, I already told you, ok, I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't, because there's so much to do for me over here, all right?",
        "Ricky: Oh, come on. Are you cheating on me?",
        "Casey: Cheating? Are you serious? You going to start talking that trash?",
        "Ricky: Well, you're always talking about being my guardian angel. What, are you throwing me over the side for some other greedy guy --",
        "Casey: Oh -- no, don't even start talking like that. You know it's not even like that, Ricky.",
        "Ricky: The point is I can show you the city like you've never seen it.",
        "Casey: What'd you do, rob a bank?",
        "Ricky: No, baby. I'm a rock star, all right? I got the city at my feet.",
        "Casey: Ok.",
        "Ricky: All right, check it out.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ricky: I got you a little something, all right? Consider it a going away present.",
        "Casey: Oh, my God, Ricky -- these are beautiful.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Try them on, try them on. Come on. Let me look, let me look. Now they're beautiful. Look at that.",
        "Casey: Um -- you know -- you know I'm still not going to be able to rock 'n' roll with you in New York, right?",
        "Ricky: Damn it, Casey! You have to go to New York with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Caleb? Caleb? Caleb? Caleb -- where'd you go? Caleb? Ok, who leaves their woman alone in the middle of the night? Where'd he go without telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Snap out of it, Alison. It's time to tell the truth.",
        "Alison: I am telling the truth. I was just out in the woods picking these.",
        "Caleb: Maybe after you went to Joshua's.",
        "Rafe: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you deaf? she said she was nowhere near Joshua's.",
        "Caleb: I was there, dude. She walked in and announced she was back home.",
        "Alison: Why would I do something like that?",
        "Caleb: Because you're out of your mind -- drugged, hypnotized, whatever. You were there.",
        "Rafe: Caleb is trying to run some scam on us again, but you're going to have to do better than that, vampire.",
        "Caleb: Don't you see what's going on here? She's lying, and you're a fool if you believe her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Ok. so you're having this total meltdown because why?",
        "Ricky: Look, Casey, I'm --",
        "Casey: Because I said I couldn't go to New York?",
        "Ricky: I'm sorry, ok? I -- I didn't mean to blow up at you.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you did.",
        "Ricky: It's just that when we're together, you're always talking about other people's problems. I mean, when do I become a priority instead of all the other bozos?",
        "Casey: Ok, you know what? Those other bozos happen to be our friends, Ricky.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I know that. But what about me?",
        "Casey: Wait -- wait, whoa -- are you in trouble? Are you in trouble? Why did I not get another clue about this?",
        "Ricky: No, no -- Casey, stop, stop. I'm not in trouble, ok? I just want to spend some time with you, that's all.",
        "Casey: That's sweet, Ricky. We -- we've already had this conversation, though, right? I mean, you, me, together alone, you know, us tempting the Gods and all. No disrespect intended. Because if you and I -- if we did what we wanted to do, followed our instincts, then, you know, I -- I'm doomed.",
        "Ricky: I think that we're both strong enough to resist temptation and, besides, you need a break. I mean, you're always looking after -- after somebody else. Well, nobody ever looks after you. I think for once you should give me a chance to do that.",
        "Casey: Oh.",
        "Ricky: I mean, that's what -- that's what you do when -- when you love somebody.",
        "Casey: Ricky. Oh, my -- no. You got to know how -- how important you are to me and you're right. You are absolutely right. There has to be a way --",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Casey: That you and I can spend time together --",
        "Ricky: Right.",
        "Casey: Without -- without -- without jeopardizing my time down here on earth.",
        "Ricky: So that means that you'll go -- you'll go with me?",
        "Casey: You say the time, and I'm there.",
        "Ricky: All right. You really trust me, don't you?",
        "Casey: Of course I trust you. I mean, you can be a jerk sometimes, but, come on, Ricky, you have a big heart, and I know you would never hurt me, so --",
        "Ricky: Right, right. I would never hurt you.",
        "Casey: What is it? what's wrong?",
        "Ricky: Nothing. Nothing is wrong --",
        "Casey: Something -- something's wrong.",
        "Ricky: I don't deserve you, Casey! That's what's wrong!",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Ricky: You shouldn't trust me! You should never trust somebody like me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How dare you call me a liar.",
        "Caleb: Give me a break. You walked in there like the Queen of England.",
        "Alison: Why would I do something like that? Rafe risked his entire life just to come save me from that place. I would never, ever go back there.",
        "Rafe: You satisfied?",
        "Caleb: Come on, man, this is right in front of your face, you don't even see it. She's here because Joshua wants her to be here. You're being set up.",
        "Rafe: All right, what do you expect, I'm going to take your word over hers? Forget it.",
        "Alison: Caleb, I think you should probably go.",
        "Rafe: You heard her. Get the hell out of here.",
        "Caleb: Ah. You know what? You two deserve what you get. Oh, Rafe -- tonight I'd sleep with my eyes open if I were you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: This is absurd.",
        "Karen: But it's working because you are thinking how absurd this is instead of what a disaster your life is.",
        "Kevin: Oh, my gosh -- I just figured it out.",
        "Karen: What?",
        "Kevin: You're the illegitimate child of Pollyanna and Nurse Ratched.",
        "Karen: Aha. Yeah, the patient is simply begging for a lobotomy, delivered with a smile.",
        "Kevin: You know, there are some people in this community that would consider that a great service.",
        "Karen: And when did you think I started caring what people say about me?",
        "Kevin: Well, I don't know, maybe the sign across your forehead, the one that says \"please love me.\"",
        "Karen: Yeah, right.",
        "Kevin: Come on, Karen. You crave approval. You're practically a textbook for, trust me.",
        "Karen: See how wrong you could be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: I can't do this. I cannot do this. I've got to tell you something, Casey. This isn't easy.",
        "Casey: Oh -- ok. All right, you're scaring me now, right? Just say it. What's wrong?",
        "Ricky: Look. There is a reason why I asked you to go to New York with me.",
        "Casey: Well, yeah, I know it is -- because we haven't been there and we keep saying --",
        "Ricky: No, Casey, no! The real reason why I asked you to go to New York with me is because maybe I thought I could push you to sleep with me.",
        "Casey: Even -- even though you -- you knew that it would mean I'd get sent back up forever?",
        "Ricky: That was the point.",
        "Casey: It was?",
        "Ricky: Look, in case you haven't noticed, my career isn't exactly going anywhere. The whole mv-3 interview is on hold. The band that I'm supposed to be fronting hasn't even gone in the studio yet. The whole thing is coming to a screeching halt!",
        "Casey: And what's that got to do with me, Ricky?",
        "Ricky: Joshua, all right? He doesn't like having angels around. It throws him off his game. He told me to make you fall.",
        "Casey: Ok. So in exchange for getting rid of me, he would jump-start your career.",
        "Ricky: Yeah. That's pretty much the whole ugly story, Casey. I've been conning you. Baby, please say something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Caleb. Hi. Where were you?",
        "Caleb: Business.",
        "Livvie: Oh. I thought you were out having fun without me.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I was having a good time banging my head against a wall. I'm sorry you missed it.",
        "Livvie: Oh. Why don't you tell me about it?",
        "Caleb: I went to see Joshua.",
        "Livvie: Did you get the ring? Stupid. Yeah. I guess not, huh?",
        "Caleb: It gets worse.",
        "Livvie: How?",
        "Caleb: Alison showed up.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Caleb: Yep. Just walked right in and said it was time for her to come home.",
        "Livvie: That's weird.",
        "Caleb: I was telling Rafe about it later, and she walks back in at the barn, denies everything, said I never saw her at Joshua's, which is kind of ironic because it's probably the only time I was ever completely honest with him and he ends up calling me a liar.",
        "Livvie: Well, that's because Rafe is wrapped around her little finger. I mean, it's a blonde thing. I don't think he can get past it.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, I think blondie just became one of Joshua's secret weapons. I don't know, somehow he's -- he's got her wired or something. If he pushes the right button, she's going to end up blowing up in someone's face.",
        "Livvie: Well, you did all you could. I mean, Rafe is obviously not believing you. So I think maybe it's time to move to plan b, as soon as we think of a plan b.",
        "Caleb: Trouble is I don't -- I don't know who the target is. If it's Rafe, then it's out of our hands. But if it's one of us, we're going to need to figure out a way to watch our backs.",
        "Livvie: Why wait? I really don't want to keep looking over my shoulder. The best defense is a good offense.",
        "Caleb: Meaning?",
        "Livvie: We have to get rid of Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Rafe: Come here.",
        "Alison: What's the matter? You're still really upset about all the things that Caleb said, aren't you? I -- I have no idea why he would make up such a ridiculous story.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, me, neither.",
        "Alison: You do know that it's ridiculous, everything he's saying?",
        "Rafe: Of course, yeah.",
        "Alison: I mean, anybody with eyes can see that it's you I love. And this is where I want to be. This is where I belong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: Ok, I'll hold the dustpan. You sweep the floor.",
        "Kevin: I take it back. You're not needy and craving approval. You're just a control freak.",
        "Karen: You know, the only reason I'm letting you insult me is because I feel sorry for you.",
        "Kevin: Oh, pity. Great. That'll make me feel a lot better. You're a good doctor, Karen.",
        "Karen: And so are you.",
        "Kevin: You're a good friend.",
        "Karen: You'll make sure to tell the landlord all my amazing qualities when he asks who broke the window.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'll take responsibility.",
        "Karen: Actually, you don't have to. We could always blame Brett.",
        "Kevin: Brett?",
        "Karen: Brett Smith. He was this kid that lived down the street from us -- very sweet, kind of cute very clumsy. You know when your parents always said, \"don't run with scissors\"?",
        "Kevin: My mother always encouraged that sort of behavior.",
        "Karen: Well, that's a whole different neuroses altogether.",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Karen: But in my neighborhood, whenever things went missing or things were broken or things just got screwed up, we'd just blame Brett.",
        "Kevin: So what happened to poor, old Brett?",
        "Karen: He grew up. Happens to the best of us.",
        "Kevin: I believe this is yours.",
        "Karen: Thanks.",
        "Kevin: Bad idea, huh?",
        "Karen: Pollyanna really liked it, but Nurse Ratched -- she says you do that again and she might have to kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm thinking that sending me down here to watch over an ingrate like you is just a really sick joke. That's what I'm thinking.",
        "Ricky: Ok, ok, you're mad.",
        "Casey: You think I'm mad, Ricky? Ricky, there are people that are dying, that are hurting, that are losing the things that they cherish, and I am wasting my time on a selfish, self-centered, egotistical -- you know, I don't even know why --",
        "Ricky: I know! I know! I made a mistake!",
        "Casey: No, shut up --",
        "Ricky: I can admit that!",
        "Casey: No, I don't know --",
        "Ricky: No, listen to me! But at least I didn't go through with it. And you know why? Because I love you.",
        "Casey: Oh. Goody. Just what a girl wants to hear after you've said, \"I've used you, I've messed you over, but, honey, I'm so sorry. I feel really bad.\" you know what, Ricky? That makes me warm! That makes me feel really warm!",
        "Ricky: Do not -- please, Casey, please! All those things that I want -- they mean nothing to me if I can't share them with you.",
        "Casey: Oh, but this just occurred to you, just right now, this moment? This just occurred to you right now? How long have you been conning me? You know what? There are people in this world that do stupid things because they just don't know any better, ok? They don't know the truth between what is good, what is evil. But you know, Ricky. You know right from wrong. So I don't understand because you' been facing evil in the face for so long now --",
        "Ricky: Right, exactly. That's why I couldn't do it. I couldn't go through with it.",
        "Casey: But you thought about it. You thought about it, and -- and if I had said yes the first time, Ricky, where would I be right now? Think about it -- where would I be? What is wrong with you?",
        "Ricky: I don't know. I don't know, ok? I don't know what's wrong with me. All I know is that loving you is the purest thing that I've ever done in my life.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Here. Aren't you just -- aren't you just a sweet talker, right?",
        "Ricky: Casey, what are you doing?",
        "Casey: What do you expect, Ricky, after you've just told a girl that you loved her, right? I mean, after all --",
        "Ricky: Stop, stop --",
        "Casey: I'm probably just your love puppet. What do you want from me --",
        "Ricky: Casey, stop, all right? Stop! I'm sorry!",
        "Casey: Thing is, Ricky, I did love you. In my whole stupid existence, you are the only thing that I ever really loved and -- you know what? it just makes me the biggest fool in the world to think that --",
        "Ricky: Please, stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Forget it. You're not killing Alison.",
        "Livvie: It's not like I'd enjoy it or anything. You're the one that said she's a threat to us, and I think there's just one way to get rid of that threat.",
        "Caleb: No. She's annoying, but she doesn't deserve the death penalty.",
        "Livvie: Ok. Do you have a better plan? Because she's just getting in the way.",
        "Caleb: The plan is destroy Joshua and get the ring back.",
        "Livvie: That hasn't worked for you so far.",
        "Caleb: I don't care. You don't touch alison. Am I being clear?",
        "Livvie: Looks like Rafe's not the only one blinded by her.",
        "Caleb: Oh, don't start.",
        "Livvie: No, obviously you care more about what happens to her than -- than to us, to me.",
        "Caleb: I'm not going to do this, Olivia! Drop it! Just drop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I love this time of year. it's so pretty out and it smells so good. All the wildflowers are in bloom. The days are longer. It's kind of a nice change because we had a long, cold winter, you know?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, we did. It was the worst. But we made it.",
        "Alison: Yeah. yeah, we did. Well, here's to -- cheers -- to brighter days. ok?",
        "Rafe: To brighter days. You know what I really want? I want some music.",
        "Alison: Where's the radio?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. well, it's probably in the car. I'll go get it. I -- I want -- more than anything else, I want to dance with you, so -- ah. Ta-da. I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: Ok. I'll wait here.",
        "[Beeping]",
        "[Beeping stops]",
        "Rafe: Ok, I got it.",
        "Alison: Rafe, it's time.",
        "Rafe: Well, yeah -- dance. What --",
        "Alison: No, no, it's time to make love right now. Right now.",
        "Rafe: Um --",
        "Alison: Right now.",
