        "Lucy: Hello. Thank you. Whoo. Thank you so very much. And to think we almost \r\ndidn't have the Nurses Ball this year. Unheard of. But here we are, look at us. \r\nWe're all here on this wonderful stage on this beautiful night. And look at all \r\nyou beautiful people out there lit by the heavens. It's truly a miracle. But the \r\nreal miracle tonight is life and another year of life for all of those out there \r\nwho are fighting HIV and AIDS. And we're so fortunate again tonight to have the \r\nAIDS quilt panel. You know, they represent all of those men and women and \r\nchildren who fought the valiant and lost, and they may be gone, but they're \r\ncertainly not forgotten. And do you know tonight is also a blessing that we're \r\nhere. It reminds me of the blessings we can give other people which can lead to \r\nmiracles. And to me, if we're able to do that, that truly is a privilege and a \r\ngift we give to ourselves. But I have some gifts for you tonight. I'm telling \r\nyou, you're going to be entertained like you've never, ever been entertained \r\nbefore in just a minute, just a teeny, tiny, little, brief minute. So just sit \r\nright there. I'll be right back. Where the heck is Gabby? ",

        "Alison: How are you feeling, Jack? ",
        "Jack: You know what? Let's forget about how I've been feeling. Tonight's \r\nabout you guys. Besides, I want things back the way they used to be. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that's fine by us, right? ",
        "Alison: Great. Fine. ",
        "Lucy: She has to be somewhere. ",
        "Joe: I'm not hiding her up my sleeve, Lucy. I don't know where Gabby is. I \r\nmean, if I did, then -- ",

        "Lucy: Thank you. Thank you so much. I know it's very hard to be patient, but \r\nI promise what you're waiting for is definitely worth the wait. Now, this is her \r\nNurses Ball debut, so we had to kind of go track her down. She's so nervous. She \r\nwas sort of hiding back there. But we found her and now I thought I'd be a great \r\nidea if maybe you put your hands together, give her a little applause, build her \r\nconfidence. ",

        "[Applause] ",
        "Lucy: Well, wow, that was something. I don't know about all of you, but after \r\nthat number, I need a little recovery time. So -- hey, I'll tell you what. Why \r\ndon't we start the silent auction? This would be a very good time. We're going \r\nto have it over in the corner there, so all of you can go place your bids, and \r\nI'll be right back up here as soon as the police vice squad leaves. ",
        "[Laughter] ",
        "Lucy: How about 15 minutes, huh? I'll give you 15 minutes to run over there \r\nand place your bids and then I'll meet you back up here on the stage, ok? So go \r\nspend your money, lots of it. Thanks. What where you doing? You participated, \r\nyou -- you -- what do you have to say for yourself? Look at you. You liked it, \r\ndidn't you? ",

        "Lucy: Never mind. Excuse me. Did you -- wait till I get my hands on her! ",
        "Kevin: Who? ",
        "Lucy: That pornographic -- I'm going to ring her -- this is supposed to be a \r\nfamily, G-rated benefit. Gabby, that's who -- didn't you see it? ",
        "Kevin: Gabby? ",
        "Lucy: Yes! ",
        "Kevin: Wow. I guess I missed some action. ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Where were you? Did I miss something, too? All these \r\nsirens, people's beepers, pagers, everything -- ",

        "Lucy: What? What is this -- what is -- where is Serena? What is this about?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Wait, I don't think there's anything to worry about just yet. ",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, just yet? ",
        "Kevin: The train from Manhattan. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. ",
        "Kevin: There was a crash, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. A -- Karen was on that train with Serena. I sent them. This \r\nis my fault. What happened? ",
        "Kevin: Calm down. Karen's fine. She's downstairs right now. ",
        "Lucy: Karen's fine? They were together. Where is Serena then? ",
        "Kevin: They got separated. That's all. Frank and Scott are looking for Serena \r\nright now. ",
        "Lucy: This can't be happening, not again. I -- I can't lose Serena, Doc. Tell \r\nme I'm not going to lose Serena.",
        "",
        "Kevin: They were in the snack car together, but apparently it happened when \r\nthey weren't standing right next to each other. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, no one actually saw Serena? They didn't know what happened to \r\nher. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, hang on just a minute. I'm sure Serena's going to show up \r\nwithout a scratch very soon. ",
        "Lucy: No, I can't hang on. I'm going down to the train to look for her now.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No, no, no, Lucy. Frank and Scott are already there looking. ",
        "Lucy: But I can help them! I can find her! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, they have cordoned off the whole area. They won't even let you \r\nin. Now, it makes a lot more sense instead of us wasting time trying to get you \r\nin, I can just get in there and start looking. Now, stay here, leave your cell \r\nphone on, and keep it close. I will call you as soon as I know anything. Now, \r\nLucy, there's a lot of people here who need you right now. It makes more sense \r\nif you just do what you have to do. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, but promise me you'll call. Stop the whole ball if you have to to \r\nget a message to me you found her. ",
        "Kevin: You know I will. ",
        "Lucy: Go find her. Go. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Go, go, go. I love you. Go. Oh. Oh, Serena. Serena, are you ok? You ok?\r\n",
        "Jamal: Livvie, we know you got a lot on your mind lately. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Well, as long as it doesn't get in the way of my feet, I think \r\nI'll be all right. Besides, Jack wants things to get back to normal, so -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, like this is normal. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Thank you very much. Listen, if the doctor or nurse that you \r\ncame with has turned up missing, don't worry. They haven't been abducted by \r\naliens. There's been -- they're downstairs, in the E.R., and they're taking care \r\nof business. And that's exactly what we have to keep doing here -- taking care \r\nof business because the show has to go on because the fight against AIDS and HIV \r\nhas to keep going on. ",
        "[Applause] ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. So we got to hang in there and keep our energy up, and \r\nthat's what we're going to do. And speaking of energy, here is a dose so \r\nexplosive, you're going to want to use that empty chair next to you to jump up \r\non and party and yell and applaud for Jamal Woods, Alison Barrington, and Livvie \r\nLocke.
