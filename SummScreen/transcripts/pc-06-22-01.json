        "Lucy: It was very nice to meet you. Thank you so much. Don, you made it! ",
        "Don: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Terrific. Hey, everybody, dinner is served. Voila! Thanks. ",
        "Colleen: Lucy, you're a lifesaver. ",
        "Lucy: No, you guys are the lifesavers, helping all these people with the \r\ntrain wreck. Go ahead. Hey, you, if you're hungry, please, everybody -- there's \r\nplenty for everybody. Help yourselves. ",
        "Deneice: If I don't get some of this quick, somebody's going to be treating \r\nme. ",
        "Lucy: Well, eat, eat. Hey, has anybody seen Kevin? ",
        "Nurse: In there. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, hey. ",
        "Kevin: I thought I heard your voice out here. ",
        "Lucy: I am so glad you're still here. I didn't think you were. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I was just finishing up counseling some of the victims. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, you look so tired and hungry. Hey, how about a nice, big, fat slice \r\nof broccoli and anchovy pizza? Oh! Oh, no. Not -- not -- oh! Not again. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I guess it wouldn't be the Nurses Ball without it. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, but, Doc, isn't that a tradition we could sort of let die a death?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I, for one, am glad to see some traditions never die. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I just want a Nurses Ball that goes off without a hitch. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you did a great job. The night was a huge success. ",
        "Lucy: It was, wasn't it? It was so much fun. We raised oodles and oodles of \r\nmoney, Serena's safe, and you're here with me. I have you. I'm so lucky I have \r\nyou. ",
        "Kevin: You don't have a whole dress. ",
        "Lucy: Well, could you hold it? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Joe: Whoa, whoa. I thought we were going to rent a suite somewhere -- you \r\nknow, caviar, champagne? Celebrate my HIV test coming back negative? ",
        "Gabriela: I thought that's what we were doing. ",
        "Joe: Well, how about we do it in style? ",
        "Gabriela: All I need is a flat surface. ",
        "Joe: Uh-huh. ",
        "Gabriela: Or not. Come here. ",
        "Joe: I never knew you were a -- you had so much talent. ",
        "Gabriela: You haven't seen the half of it yet. ",
        "Joe: Well, as long as I'm the only one who does. You know, your little \r\nroutine at the Nurses Ball was -- ",
        "Gabriela: I did good, didn't I? ",
        "Joe: Yeah. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, it was just -- just a little over the top. ",
        "Gabriela: What, are you nervous because your mom was there? ",
        "Joe: I've just never seen you so uninhibited before. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, maybe you should take a closer look. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Oh. Talk about a night of disasters. ",
        "Jamal: I didn't think our routine was that bad. ",
        "Alison: Well, I'm just glad that it's over -- train wrecks, floods. What else \r\ncould happen? ",
        "Livvie: I wonder how Jack's doing. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, he must have felt pretty bad to cut out early like that. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, he said he was going to come back and get some sleep. I'm going \r\nto go check on him. ",
        "Alison: So. ",
        "Jamal: So. ",
        "Alison: Big night tonight, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Oh. Yeah, they must've made a killing. Did you see how much those \r\nYankee boxes went for in the silent auction? ",
        "Alison: Yeah -- no, that's not what I'm talking about. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, the walk-on role for \"All My Children?\" Yeah, I know. ",
        "Alison: You really don't know what today is, do you? ",
        "Jamal: Well, something tells me the answer's not \"Friday.\" ",
        "Alison: No. Forget it. Forget it. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, you really don't remember, do you? ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Alison: Well, a year ago tonight was our first date at the Nurses Ball. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: It has been a whole year, hasn't it? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, sure has. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. We should've -- should've celebrated or something. ",
        "Alison: I know, or something. ",
        "Jamal: Something. ",
        "Alison: That's ok. ",
        "Jamal: So, I guess you probably wouldn't be interested in this, huh? ",
        "Alison: What is that? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, nothing. I mean, you're right. I mean, our one-year anniversary is \r\nprobably no big deal -- ",
        "Alison: Come on, come on! ",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. ",
        "Alison: Please, please! Please, don't toy with me. ",
        "Alison: Oh. These are beautiful. You shouldn't have done this. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah, right! ",
        "Alison: No, I'm serious. We're, like, trying to save money and stuff. ",
        "Jamal: And? It was important to me. ",
        "Alison: Oh. I love them. I love you. ",
        "Jamal: Happy anniversary, Spunky. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. ",
        "Livvie: Jack's not in his room. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe he just went out to get some air. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. I'll go look. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. I'll come with you. ",
        "Livvie: Me, too. ",
        "Jamal: Well, somebody's got to stay here just in case Jack comes back. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I think it should be Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: But I -- ",
        "Alison: No, no -- we'll find him and we'll bring him back, I promise. We'll \r\nbe right back. ",
        "",
        "Sam: Well, look who we found. Heard you were back from the dead, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Sorry, Sam. ",
        "Sam: I saw you. You didn't move, you weren't breathing. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah. Zach -- Zach didn't finish the job. ",
        "Sam: Well, we're going to finish it for him. ",
        "Jack: No. You don't want to do that. ",
        "Sam: First you toss our diamonds, then you smoke Zach. ",
        "Jack: Look, I didn't kill Zach, Sam. ",
        "Sam: Yes, you did. And now you're going to stay dead. ",

        "Lucy: Mmm. ",
        "Kevin: Feeling that good, huh? ",
        "Lucy: How can I not be? I mean, come on, we raised a lot of money. ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: Serena's safe and sound. I'm with you. I don't want to think about that \r\nNurses Ball for at least another year. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, at least a couple weeks. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. I give it a month. ",
        "Kevin: A month? ",
        "Lucy: Moratorium. ",
        "Kevin: A -- oh, lord, be praised. ",
        "Lucy: No, I want to concentrate all that time on you. ",
        "Kevin: Hmm? ",
        "Lucy: Hmm. ",
        "Nurse: Dr. Collins? ",
        "Kevin: Yes? ",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry to interrupt, but we need you in three. The lady's pretty \r\nshook up after the train wreck. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Go, go. I'll wait. ",
        "Kevin: You're sure? I don't know how long this will be. ",
        "Lucy: It's ok. I've got my pizza, and I'm just going to sit here and clear my \r\nbrain of all thoughts but you. ",
        "Kevin: I'll see you later. ",
        "Lucy: Go. ",
        "Alison: Hey, Deneice. Have you or Colleen seen Jack Ramsey tonight? ",
        "Colleen: No. Haven't seen him. ",
        "Deneice: Nope, no Jack Ramsey. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Alison. Hi. ",
        "Alison: Lucy, hi. ",
        "Lucy: So, is everything all right, I hope? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, everything's fine. Why? ",
        "Lucy: Well, what are you doing here in the E.R. looking for Jack? ",
        "Alison: Oh. Oh, well, he had to leave early from the Nurses Ball. You know, \r\nhe said he wasn't really feeling that great, so I thought maybe it was just, \r\nlike, indigestion. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, no. I don't think so. My choice of food was impeccable. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, it must've just been a bug or something. He probably just \r\nwent back to his room. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah. Where's Livvie? ",
        "Alison: Well, with him, I'm sure. ",
        "Lucy: Are you really sure? ",
        "Alison: Yes. Lucy, I just saw her a little bit ago. She's fine, I'm sure. \r\nThere's nothing to worry about. ",
        "Lucy: Fine, but -- you know, I'm not trying to pry. I'm not really a \r\nbusybody, you know. It's just that Livvie is Doc's daughter, which practically \r\nmakes her my stepdaughter. And Jack is dating Livvie, which makes Jack -- well, \r\nwe're sort of related somehow. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, ok. Lucy, everybody's fine. Jack's fine, Livvie's fine, I'm \r\nfine. Everything's fine. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. ",
        "Alison: Fine. ",

        "Caleb: Is he? You lie awake at night wondering, feeling he doesn't seem quite \r\nright. Not the man you fell in love with. ",
        "Livvie: How could you -- ",

        "Gabriela: There's lots more. ",
        "Joe: And we'll have plenty of time for it, all right? Now that we know that \r\nwe have a future together. Oh, the people from Bounds Corners called this \r\nafternoon. They're sending our tickets next week. ",
        "Gabriela: No. ",

        "Kevin: That's not a dream, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: But it is to me, especially after last year. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, don't do that to yourself, not now. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's ok. I can do it now. That's just the point. Doc, when I lost \r\nChristina, you know, I thought the world had come to an end. I thought I just \r\nnever wanted to wake up. I thought all the light had gone out of the world, and \r\nI just wanted to be alone forever. But you're back, and I'm happy again. ",
        "Kevin: You know, Lucy, no one ever thinks they'll be happy again when tragedy \r\nhits. ",
        "Lucy: I wish I could tell them they would be, though. It's going to get \r\nbetter. I mean, you always carry a piece of that tragedy with you, and I always \r\nwill, but it gets good. It's good again. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, it is good -- for both of us. And I hit bottom, too, Lucy. If it \r\nhadn't been for you and Livvie, I don't know -- ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Livvie. Oh, Livvie, Livvie -- have you heard from her? ",
        "Kevin: No. Should I? ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, it's kind of strange. ",
        "Kevin: Strange? How? ",
        "Lucy: Well, Alison came to the ER looking for Jack. ",
        "Kevin: Looking for Jack here? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, because he wasn't feeling very well. ",
        "Kevin: Not well enough to be at the ER? ",
        "Lucy: See, this is my point. I asked Alison, and she sort of made this excuse \r\nabout, \"Oh, Livvie's probably with Jack back at Jack's place.\" Oh -- oh, gosh, \r\nand I've been meaning to tell you this. There's also another teeny, tiny, little \r\nweird thing that's going on. ",
        "Kevin: How teeny? ",
        "Lucy: Well, this. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, that's a bullet. What are you doing with that? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I know. Remember at the river, that altercation with the kids and \r\nthe police when we were there? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. What about it? ",
        "Lucy: Remember when Jack jumped in front of that bullet meant for Jamal that \r\nthe police fired, and the police thought he hit him, but somehow he missed Jack?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah, not something I'll forget soon. ",
        "Lucy: I found this, Doc, on the ground there. ",
        "Kevin: Let me see that. ",
        "Lucy: Look, doesn't it -- it looks like it hit something, right? ",
        "Kevin: Maybe a tree. ",
        "Lucy: But it was empty. It was open space, kind of, you know? I think maybe \r\n-- just maybe it hit Jack, and that's why he's acting so strange. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, if it did, he wouldn't even be walking. No human in the world is \r\nstrong enough for that. But you're right, though. It definitely hit something.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Ok, then. If it didn't hit Jack, then what? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. But there is something strange going on. ",
