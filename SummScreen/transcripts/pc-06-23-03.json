        "Lucy thanks her unseen visitor for being there for her. Ian is startled to find her talking to what he believes is a hallucination, but he doesn't let on that he observed anything. Using a video camera, Lucy records her goodbyes to the girls and to Ian. Olivia's jealousy over Alison causes yet another argument with Caleb, who is tired of having to prove his devotion to her. Olivia admits that she doesn't know why she hates Alison. Going even further, she says that she's not even certain that she does indeed hate her former best friend. She promises to stop obsessing about her if Caleb will answer one question. She asks whether he would stop wanting her if she were to get rid of Alison. When Caleb assures her that he could never stop wanting her, she promises to stop bugging him about it. Joshua doesn't appreciate Jamal's questions about his relationship with Alison. When Jamal persists, Joshua states that everything will soon be crystal clear. Ian asks Caleb for information about the healing pool. Caleb assures him that he would help if he could, but he doesn't know anything. Walking away, Olivia asks whether he was telling the truth, and Caleb states that although he likes Lucy, she's still a slayer. After making love, Alison and Rafe pick berries and plan a picnic. Alison pulls out a gun and aims it at Rafe, claiming not to know how to use it. Rafe teaches her, and although he tells her not to squeeze the trigger, she does, just as Jamal arrives at the barn. Jamal confirms that Joshua is definitely up to something, and he needs to stick around and find out what it is. When Rafe steps outside to call Lucy, Alison's watch alarm goes off. Jamal is suspicious of Alison's strange behavior. When he leaves, Alison insists on taking Rafe to a very special place. Alone, Joshua gloats about his plan to use his bride to eliminate the slayer."

        "Lucy: My amazing, incredible girls. How do I do this? Ok you start at the beginning, that's what you do. You got to -- oh, Serena. I remember that sweater. That was your very first -- first day of school. Oh, you were so brave. You said, \"I'm not going in there, mom,\" and I said, \"yes, you are,\" and then you just marched right in there and never looked back. Didn't cry one tear. And I sat in that parking lot crying buckets. You had the best day. I was so, so proud of you.",
        "Ian: Thought you might like some tea.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Ian: What are you doing?",
        "Lucy: You know, I always talked about that I really needed to organize this. Well, I think no time like the present, don't you think?",
        "Ian: All right, but you need to stop for a while and eat something.",
        "Lucy: No, I can't. I can't stop. I have to get this done. This is really important to do for my daughters. I have to show them, record what kind of family time we had together, that we had so many beautiful memories together.",
        "Ian: I know, I know, I know, but you need to eat because you're going to upset the cook, and you don't want to do that.",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. Sorry, I just can't. I'm not hungry.",
        "Ian: Just a little something, come on. Then I'll run you a bath and give you a nice massage. How's that sound?",
        "Lucy: Great. Thanks.",
        "Ian: Fruit. I forgot the fruit. I cut up food and I forgot it.",
        "Lucy: No, I don't need any fruit. Would you stop?",
        "Ian: I'll be back in a flash. It's all right. Just do it for that.",
        "Lucy: I feel you. You're here, aren't you? Where -- there you are. I wish I could see your face, though, and really know who you are. Never mind. It doesn't matter. You're here and you can see that beautiful man that's driving me crazy. You know, I know he just wants to do something for me and make me comfortable, but -- thank you for being here. I'm glad. I have an awful lot to do, don't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I cannot keep doing this with you.",
        "Livvie: Doing what?",
        "Caleb: Proving myself, proving that I love you. This has got to stop or else.",
        "Livvie: Or what? You're going to throw me over for Alison?",
        "Caleb: Don't you get it? Our enemies are getting stronger every day, but I'm stuck here, holding hands with you, trying to convince you that I love you, and the whole time all you can do is think about her.",
        "Livvie: Why do you care so much about what happens to her?",
        "Caleb: I don't.",
        "Livvie: Liar.",
        "Caleb: Alison is not the priority here.",
        "Livvie: Still lying!",
        "Caleb: If you don't trust m we're not going to make it. And it won't be Alison that separates us, it'll be you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Mind telling me what's going on?",
        "Joshua: What's the matter, Jamal, you didn't get the memo? I'm taking over Port Charles and, once I catch my breath, the rest of the planet.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, in the meantime, you send me on this wild-goose chase looking for Rafe, when all along you know that he's getting back with Alison. So what's the deal with that?",
        "Joshua: She was too high-maintenance.",
        "Jamal: That's too bad. I mean, considering you spent all this trouble getting her here, I'm just wondering if there's more to the story.",
        "Joshua: Always. There's always more to the story, Jamal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I could hide away with you here forever.",
        "Alison: I just hated being away from you. I needed to show you how much I want you and how much I need you.",
        "Rafe: Well --",
        "Alison: Hmm.",
        "Rafe: I know you're probably pretty upset, Caleb coming in here, accusing you of being under Joshua's spell.",
        "Alison: Shh. No, no, no, no. Let's not talk about that, ok?",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: No more.",
        "Rafe: All right. But just so you know, I mean, he is out of our lives now. Everything is ok.",
        "Alison: I know. I don't want to talk about Caleb and I don't want to talk about Joshua. It isn't time for that. It isn't time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Really, I'm glad you're here. I feel like you really understand. There's just so many people here that I love very much that I -- I just hate to leave. And I hope it's not too much to ask -- I mean, could you help them? I mean, when I'm gone, I think they're going to need all the help they can get, if you could do that.",
        "Ian: Is everything all right?",
        "Lucy: Everything is great, and you make one mean sandwich. Mmm.",
        "Ian: You haven't touched it.",
        "Lucy: I know. Sorry. I will, though. I want to touch it. I mean, I'm going to eat it. I will.",
        "Ian: You've got to eat. You do have to eat. You need to keep your strength up.",
        "Lucy: Look, what you're doing -- look at your fruit plate.",
        "Ian: I made a star.",
        "Lucy: It's beautiful, but I don't -- I need you to stop hovering like I'm going to break any minute. I'm not made of glass.",
        "Ian: I know. I'm trying to take care of you.",
        "Lucy: I know that.",
        "Ian: Because if I don't do that, I don't know what I'm going to do, you know? And if I -- not about me, though, is it? Ahem. What do you need from me?",
        "Lucy: I need you to help me realize that no one's going to walk through that door and give me some magic cure, and we need to face that this is the end of my life -- yes, yes.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Lucy: And there's so many things I need to do and so many things I need to say before -- so what I need you to do, please just help me say goodbye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Ok, so what's the real deal between you and Alison?",
        "Joshua: Excuse me?",
        "Jamal: You said there was more to the story, so I just --",
        "Joshua: So you thought that perhaps I would, what, share it with you?",
        "Jamal: No, I just thought --",
        "Joshua: You're not paid to think, Jamal, you're asked to do.",
        "Jamal: So you're saying basically all I need to know is that it's over between you and Alison, then?",
        "Joshua: You're a quick study, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Ok, that's good enough for me. It's just that I thought that I was here to get your back, and so how am I supposed to do a good job if you're keeping me in the dark?",
        "Joshua: In a few days, everything will become crystal clear to you. Have you got that?",
        "Jamal: You're the boss.",
        "Joshua: I have work to do. Get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, you think we picked enough berries?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just put them in the bucket. Perfect! Yeah, we got a lot, actually. Which one's your favorite?",
        "Rafe: Hmm. I say strawberries. Because, you know, it seems like you like them a lot, too. That's --",
        "[Alison gasps]",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Sorry. You know what I think we should do before we go home?",
        "Rafe: Hmm, what's that?",
        "Alison: We should pick some more so that we can make a nice, big juicy pie.",
        "Rafe: Yes. Yes, the key word is \"we,\" because you're not going to be baking alone. I want you to show me. I want you to show me how to do it. I will help -- I will help you bake. I will be the baking man.",
        "Alison: Really? Really? I can see you in the kitchen with nothing but an apron on. Might be kind of nice.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah, I bet you'd like that, huh?",
        "Alison: Well, it's very \"normal,\" you know.",
        "Rafe: Right. Nothing I'd like more now than just to be dealing with everyday stuff, but I don't know if there's much of a shot of doing it until we destroy Joshua, you know.",
        "Alison: Ok, Rafe, look, I don't want to think about that right now.",
        "Rafe: Well, we have to.",
        "Alison: Please, can't we just, like, enjoy the beautiful moment and us being together --",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine, fine, that's what I want to do. That's what I want to do more than anything, but --",
        "Alison: Good.",
        "Rafe: I mean, we're not going to be able to do that until we take care of Joshua. I mean, he could be up there planning God knows-what --",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No, no, no.",
        "Rafe: We got to think --",
        "Alison: You're only supposed to be thinking about me at this point.",
        "Rafe: Hmm. Come here. You taste kind of sweet.",
        "Alison: So do you. Kind of like strawberries and summer.",
        "Rafe: Hmm. Why don't you break out all the supplies, and I'll spread out the blanket and we'll have ourselves a little picnic.",
        "Alison: Oh, ok.",
        "Rafe: It'll be great. We can just lie around all day, feeding each other berries, hiding out from the rest of the world, because who needs the world? How's that sound?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Camera beeps]",
        "Ian: Ok. Anytime.",
        "Lucy: Hello, my amazing, beautiful, breathtaking daughters. I think you already know this, but you are and have been and always will be the joy of my life. I do not want you to be sad. I mean, I know it's going to be hard and you're going to be sad when I'm gone, but I need you to really think about this because this is a good thing. I have had the most amazing, incredible, complicated, wacky life that any person could ever ask for. I have. And this -- this dying thing, you know, that people do, it's what we do. It's part of that wonderful, wacky life that I've had. It's just part of it. And I -- I don't want you to worry because I'm not afraid. It's just the next step. That's what you do. It's the next step, and I'm taking the next step. And I do not want you to get angry and fill the void that I leave with that anger, because any universe that created you two is all good. I hope you understand that. I love you. I love you so very much. And if you get a chance to have somebody come into your life that could be a mom to you -- not take my place, but just give you that kind of love -- I want you to take that chance, because you can never have too much love in your life. If there's one thing you had better have gotten through those beautiful little heads of yours is that about love, because love is everything, and if you find it, I want you to hold on and you never let that go. You know that. I taught you that, I hope. So don't cry, not too much. I want you to live. Because I'm not going away. I'm just going on ahead. I'm just scouting the way for both of you. So God bless you, my little pumpkin heads. And you just remember that wherever there is love, I'll be there with you, always. Always.",
        "[Camera beeps]",
        "Ian: All right, you listen to me --",
        "Lucy: I'm ok. No. Shh. I'm good. I just -- I don't want them to grieve like that. I want them to live. You know how much I loved to live and you know how much I enjoy life. I need them to do that, ok?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Ok. And I need you to go now. Just -- not far, but I -- can I -- can I be alone for just a minute?",
        "Ian: You want me to leave you?",
        "Lucy: No, I don't want you to leave me. I just -- I just need -- I need to just sit. I won't do anything, I promise --",
        "Ian: Ok, ok.",
        "Lucy: And I'll eat that sandwich if you want, but I need to be here.",

        "Livvie: So, you are going to leave me. Perfect. Alison's ruined another one of my relationships. That's great.",
        "Caleb: If that's all you heard, then you weren't listening to a word I said. I can't keep doing this.",
        "Livvie: Ok, sorry. I overreacted a bit.",
        "Caleb: You are not rational when it comes to Alison.",
        "Livvie: No, I'm not! I'm not. I admit that. And you want to hear something that's going to convince you I am even crazier? I don't even know why I hate her. I mean, I don't -- I don't even know if I do hate her. I think I like her. I'm not sure. I'm -- I somehow like her or the thought of our friendship, what it was at one time, but when she opens her mouth and smiles that big smile, I want to wipe it off of her face.",
        "Caleb: Why you feel threatened is beyond me. But I cannot keep having this conversation with you.",
        "Livvie: Here's the deal -- I -- I'll stop obsessing over Alison if you'll answer one question.",
        "Caleb: Which is?",
        "Livvie: Which is if I were to get rid of her, would you leave me?",
        "Caleb: I'm not even going to answer that.",
        "Livvie: No, really, be honest with me. If I were to somehow make her disappear, would you still want me?",
        "Caleb: Nothing could make me stop wanting you. I guess you're my obsession.",
        "Livvie: Ok. That's -- that's all I really wanted to hear. I will stop bugging you--",

        "Rafe: Alison, what are you doing?",
        "Alison: Well, I've held a gun before, but I've never fired one.",
        "Rafe: Maybe it's time that you maybe learned how. Come here. Come here. You know, just in case. Come here. Now, lift it up.",
        "Alison: And aim, right?",
        "Rafe: Well, just cock it. Ok, got the target in your sights?",
        "Alison: Uh-huh.",

        "Alison: Just like this?",
        "Rafe: Ok, right.",
        "Alison: Yeah? Yeah?",
        "Rafe: You got the target, and then you pull the trigger, ok? But we're not going to do that.",
        "Jamal: Hey! What's going on?",
        "Rafe: It's ok. We're just -- just a little shooting practice.",
        "Jamal: All right, well, I guess you're back, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I am. I'm -- I'm back. Joshua's not going to bother me anymore.",

        "Rafe: If he thinks that you're on our side, then --",
        "Jamal: Rafe, I'm cool. Ok? I'm fine. He already thinks I'm just a zombie with a blood jones, that's it. He doesn't suspect me.",

        "Jamal: Yeah, I know, you've always hated those things. What made you start using it now?",
        "Alison: I just need one lately. I'm sort of forgetful. It's a reminder for me to call my mother.",
