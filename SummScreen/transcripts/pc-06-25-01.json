        "Joe: You keep saying that. What do you mean? What's changed? ",
        "Gabriela: I just can't. ",
        "Joe: Gabby, please talk to me. What's going on? Is it your family? Are you \r\nstarting to feel like it'd be too hard to leave them? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know. ",
        "Joe: All right, look, we've both been under a lot of stress lately, all \r\nright, waiting for my HIV results, planning this move. Maybe you're just feeling \r\noverwhelmed. I mean, it's no secret that you've been acting a little strange \r\nlately. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't want to talk. ",
        "Joe: Well, we don't have to right now. ",
        "Gabriela: All I want is you. Make love to me. I don't want to think about \r\nanything else! ",

        "Alison: Jamal, what is going on? ",
        "Jamal: I had to get you out of there. ",
        "Alison: Well, we can't leave Jack there with all those guys. ",
        "Jamal: Those guys are not moving because of Jack. ",
        "Alison: He beat all of them up himself? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. See what I'm saying? ",
        "Alison: No, I don't see. I don't understand. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you didn't see the look in his eye. ",
        "Alison: What look? What are you talking about? ",
        "Jamal: Like he wanted to kill them. ",
        "Alison: Are you sure? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I even thought he was coming after me for a sec. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: But, Ali, he snapped out it, ok, but he was just out of control like a \r\nwild animal. ",
        "Alison: Well, what do you think is going on with him? ",
        "Jamal: I don't know, but I'm going to find out. ",
        "Alison: Where are we going? ",

        "Jack: Lucy, I have to find Livvie. I need Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm sure you do, but first you need to -- where have you been?\r\n",
        "Jack: That doesn't matter. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, wait. Whoa, whoa. Yes, it does matter. Jack, Alison came to the \r\nER looking for you. I was worried. Are you ok? ",
        "Jack: I'm fine. All I care about is Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I know. I can see that. ",
        "Jack: I know she's here somewhere. I got to find her. ",
        "Lucy: Please just stop. Tea. You know what? Doc's on an emergency call. Why \r\ndon't we just wait till he gets back. You know, we'll have a nice -- ooh, a hot \r\ncup of tea and we'll sit down and chat, you know, just relax. Here. ",

        "Lucy: I know. It -- it's ok, Jack. I know you didn't, but, you know, we need \r\nto talk. Well, go ahead. Help yourself. You know, you and Livvie -- you never \r\nreally shared with me an explanation about what happened when you disappeared, \r\nyou know, and I thought maybe it'd be a good time to chat -- hey, if you want me \r\nto make you something else -- are you that hungry? I can whip up -- I'm not very \r\ngood, but I -- oh, my God, Jack, what is it? You don't -- you don't look so \r\ngood. Are you ok? Jack? ",
        "Jack: I need Livvie. I'll feel better when I find her. ",
        "Lucy: I don't think so. I think you look like you need a lot more than just \r\nLivvie. Jack -- ",
        "Jack: No, Lucy, I need to see her. I need to touch her. ",
        "Lucy: I want to know what's going on first. I can't help if -- what is going \r\non with you? ",
        "Jack: I can't, I can't. I have to go. ",

        "Lucy: No. Sit. You need to sit. You have to sit down, Jack. Just sit down for \r\na minute. You're -- you're burning up. Take your coat off. Here, give me your \r\narms. Take your coat off. Oh, my God. The cop that shot at you -- he didn't miss \r\nyou, did he? That bullet hit you. ",

        "Caleb: I've looked for you in every crowd, in every woman's face, but none of \r\nthem were right because none of them were you. ",

        "Caleb: There's nothing that we can't do together, Olivia. ",

        "Livvie: You -- you mean you want me to stay? ",
        "Caleb: Well, I'd never force you to stay. I want you to choose to stay. I \r\nwant you to think of me as your protector. I want to be as vital to you as the \r\nair you breathe. You will feel all these things. I can already see it in your \r\neyes. ",

        "Joe: That was incredible. ",
        "Joe: Come here. Come here. I know it's strange not having anything hanging \r\nover us, you know, nothing to hold us back. I'm still getting used to the fact \r\nthat I'm HIV-negative. We've lived with that uncertainty for so long. I guess \r\nthat's why -- that's why I've been rushing this move, you know, because I don't \r\nwant to be held back anymore, Gabby. I'm sorry if it's been too fast for you. We \r\ncan slow down. All that matters is -- is that you know how much I love you. \"I \r\nknow, Joe, and I love you, too.\" Gabby, what's wrong? ",
        "Gabriela: I'm sorry. ",
        "Joe: I don't want you to apologize. I want -- I want you to talk to me. ",
        "Gabriela: I just need some time. ",
        "Joe: No, no. No, you need to be honest with me. ",
        "Gabriela: You're right. You deserve the truth. ",

        "Alison: I know, figuring all this stuff out with Jack. Ok, we can do that \r\ntogether. I can help you. ",

        "Jamal: No, Jack is crazy right now, ok? We can't be sure what he's going to \r\ndo. ",
        "Alison: Look, ok, you caught him in the middle of a fight. You know, he's all \r\npumped up, he's all -- ",
        "Jamal: Ali, I know what I saw, ok, and I know you keep trying to make sense \r\nof this and everything, but you can't. ",
        "Alison: Well, then we'll figure it out together because I'm not leaving you.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Look, Ali, you have to, ok? Like when he kissed you, he was just out \r\nof control. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, that was a joke. ",
        "Jamal: Alison, that was not a joke. ",
        "Alison: Oh -- ",
        "Jamal: It was not, ok? He is just tripping. Ok, he's been tripping for a long \r\ntime, even before the race. Ali, we buried him. ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Jamal: That coffin was in pieces like -- like he just burst out of it. And \r\nnow he's just walking around without a scratch on him after going over a cliff? \r\nAli, come on! ",
        "Alison: I know it's freaky -- ",
        "Jamal: No, no, it's whacked-out is what it is, and I don't want you around \r\nhim. Look, Alison, don't fight me on this. Jack is violent right now. He threw \r\nChris around like he was nothing. I just saw him whip three guys without even \r\nbreaking a sweat. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, we are his friends. ",
        "Jamal: It doesn't matter because when he snaps, it's just -- Alison, we still \r\ndon't know who killed Zach. ",

        "Alison: No way. ",
        "Jamal: We don't know what Jack did, and we don't know what he's going to do. \r\nOk, that's all I'm saying. Ok, but I'm not taking any chances, ok, not with you.\r\n",

        "Jack: No, no, it couldn't have. ",
        "Lucy: Maybe it just grazed you and that would explain all of this. ",
        "Jack: Explain what, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Look at the way you've been acting, the way you're feeling. Jack, maybe \r\nthis hit you, you know, and it just -- it just grazed you and caused some damage \r\nin your body and now you have an infection. ",
        "Jack: Maybe that's the pain I've been feeling. ",

All right, now listen, I just want to \r\ntake a look at your side, you know, where the bullet might have hit. Maybe I can \r\nsee something or feel something. I don't -- I don't feel anything.
