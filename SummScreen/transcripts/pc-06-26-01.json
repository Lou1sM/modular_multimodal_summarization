        "Livvie: Stop. Stop. It was just a dream. Right? I mean, a dream. ",

        "Livvie: Jack. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, hi. ",
        "Livvie: Alison, thank God you're here. ",
        "Jamal: What's wrong, Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: I think Jack may be in trouble. ",
        "Jamal: He's not the only one. You might be in trouble, too. ",

        "Lucy: Karen. ",
        "Karen: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. Listen, any change in Jack since I left last night? ",
        "Karen: Oh, there's been change, all right. ",
        "Lucy: What do you mean? For the worse? ",
        "Karen: Well, we had to give him a blood transfusion. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Karen: He was anemic. We gave him some plasma, hydrated him -- ",
        "Lucy: And that didn't help? ",
        "Karen: Well, most people feel better, but we couldn't believe his reaction.\r\n",
        "Lucy: What do you mean? What kind of reaction? ",
        "Karen: Well, take a look for yourself. ",
        "Lucy: Jack? ",
        "Jack: Hey, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, hey, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Hey, you're on the hospital board, right? Do you think you could talk \r\nto somebody about letting me out of here? I really need to find Livvie. ",
        "Karen: The most amazing recovery I've ever seen. ",
        "",
        "Ian: What do you say? ",
        "Eve: I still say it is the most beautiful ring I have ever seen. ",
        "Ian: No -- what do you say about going inside? Or are you going to look at \r\nthat Cracker Jack prize I gave you?",
        "Eve: Cracker Jack? ",
        "Ian: Got your attention, didn't I? ",
        "Eve: Oh, you're funny. Come on, I can't wait to go inside and tell Michael \r\nthat we are engaged. ",
        "Ian: Let me get that for you. ",
        "Eve: Why, thank you. Michael? ",
        "Ian: Padre, are you there? ",
        "Eve: Michael? Maybe he's out chopping wood. ",
        "Ian: Going to check? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",

        "Ian: Something's wrong here. ",
        "[Faint pounding] ",
        "Eve: There it is again. It's coming from over there. ",
        "Ian: The cellar. ",
        "Eve: Let's go. Maybe we should check -- ",
        "Ian: No. He had his brother locked up in there. ",
        "Eve: I know. ",
        "Ian: He's dangerous. ",
        "Eve: We can't just walk away. What do we do? ",

        "Eve: Michael. Oh, my God. Are you all right? ",
        "Ian: What happened? ",
        "Michael: He locked me down here. ",
        "Ian: Who? Your brother? ",
        "Eve: Here. Here. Here. ",
        "Michael: Thank you. I was just trying to counsel him. ",
        "Eve: What about? ",
        "Michael: A woman he's got -- he's obsessed. He's got this fixation. ",
        "Ian: How long have you been down here? ",
        "Michael: Not sure. ",
        "Ian: Easy. ",
        "Eve: Well, I am sure. Listen, your brother's crossed the line this time. ",
        "Michael: No, Eve, don't, please. ",
        "Eve: No. This is not just about you or your brother anymore. There is a woman \r\ninvolved here. ",
        "Michael: No, listen to me. You don't understand. You're only going to make \r\nthings worse. ",
        "Ian: Stay down. This has to be dealt with. ",
        "Eve: That's right. Now, this is for your own good and for your brother's. You \r\nhelped us. Now let us help you. ",
        "Michael: Oh, no. ",
        "Eve: Hello? Connect me with the sheriff's office, please. ",

        "Sam: Ramsey. We got to talk now. ",
        "Chris: Starting my rotation takes precedence over listening to your lies. ",
        "Sam: I wasn't lying. ",
        "Chris: You're pathological. Excuse me. ",
        "Sam: Will you just listen? Look, it takes a lot to scare me, ok? A lot to \r\nshake me up. ",
        "Chris: And? ",
        "Sam: And your brother's scaring me. If you're smart, you're going to do \r\nsomething about that maniac while you still can because you could be next on his \r\nhit parade, doctor. ",
        "",
        "Jack: But I keep trying to tell you, the only thing wrong with me is I'm not \r\nwith Livvie. That's all. ",
        "Lucy: You didn't find anything, you know, that could have happened being hit \r\nby a bullet, nothing? ",
        "Karen: No, there was no trace of impact, not even a bruise. ",
        "Lucy: But there was a hole in his jacket. ",
        "Karen: I know. Well, it could have been from anything, or maybe it was the \r\nbullet and it hit your wallet or your keys. ",
        "Jack: I don't understand what the problem is here. I'm fine. ",
        "Karen: Patients in the shape you were in don't recover in full that fast. ",
        "Jack: Well, it's not the first time being the exception to a rule. ",
        "Karen: I think we need to rerun your blood work. I'll be right back. ",
        "Jack: No, Doc, don't be long, all right, because I want out of here. ",
        "Lucy: Jack, no. No -- ",
        "Jack: No, Lucy, no. I need to be with Livvie. Ok? And you could have brought \r\nher here. ",
        "Lucy: No, I couldn't have. ",
        "Jack: Yes, you could. ",
        "Lucy: No, I couldn't have, not until we straighten something out here, like \r\nwhat happened to you at the lighthouse. That was bad. You don't remember what \r\nhappened? ",
        "Jack: Ok, I remember bits and pieces before making it to the lighthouse. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, bits -- bits and pieces. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Zach's motorcycle gang. I remember them surrounding me and \r\nattacking me. ",
        "Lucy: They attacked you? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Well, do you think that's what happened to you? Is that what could have \r\nstarted this? ",
        "Jack: I don't know, I don't know. I just know that they jumped me. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, go on. They jumped you, and what? ",
        "Jack: And then it was over -- and there were -- there were all these -- all \r\nthese bodies laying around, like -- ",
        "Lucy: Like what? ",
        "Jack: Like the carnage, like you see in the movies, like with \"Braveheart,\" \r\nwith all these bodies are -- oh, no, no. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait. Take it easy. Yeah, take it easy. It's ok. ",
        "Jack: No, no, I need Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: No, you need to calm down. ",
        "Jack: No, I need her right now, ok? Trust me, I will be fine if I'm just with \r\nLivvie. Ok? Please? ",

        "Jamal: I don't know how to help him, but Jack is out of control. ",
        "Livvie: And I know if that pack of motorcycle monkeys got hurt, they deserved \r\nwhat they got. ",
        "Alison: We are not saying that they didn't. ",
        "Livvie: Then what are you saying? ",
        "Alison: Jack is not the same guy that he used to be. ",
        "Livvie: So? None of us are. We change. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, Livvie, not like this. ",
        "Livvie: Like what? He hasn't done anything to me. ",
        "Jamal: No, not yet. ",
        "Livvie: Not ever, and I'll never give up on him. I love him. If anyone should \r\nunderstand -- ",
        "Alison: Livvie, I do, ok? I do. We're not saying to turn your back on him.\r\n",
        "Livvie: No, you're saying I should stop seeing him. Well, forget it. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, Livvie, listen, just do this for me, then. Just steer clear of the \r\nguy until we get back, ok? ",
        "Livvie: From where? ",
        "Jamal: Try to get some answers. ",
        "Alison: Trust us, please. Ok, we just want to talk to somebody, see if they \r\ncan maybe explain why Jack is acting the way he is. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, I was just going to stay here and study and go to bed early \r\nanyway. I'll lock up as soon as you guys leave. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, and you won't answer to anybody except me or Ali, right? ",
        "Livvie: Fine. But Jack loves me. I know that. ",

        "Michael: I was trying to talk to my brother about his personal relationship \r\nproblems, and he got angry. ",
        "Sheriff: And locked you in the cellar. ",
        "Michael: To get back at me. ",
        "Deputy: For locking him in the cellar. ",
        "Eve: This is not your typical case of sibling rivalry. ",
        "Ian: We're talking about a violent man here. He almost destroyed this entire \r\nchurch. ",
        "Sheriff: You actually saw this Caleb rip the place apart, doctor? ",
        "Ian: No -- ",
        "Eve: Well, no, but we saw the damage afterward. ",
        "Deputy: Too bad. If you'd witnessed the vandalism, we'd have something to \r\nprosecute. ",
        "Sheriff: We can only write this up as a domestic desecration of property, \r\nassuming you want to press charges, padre. ",
        "Michael: Which I don't. ",

        "Eve: Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's it? You're just going to walk away? ",
        "Sheriff: That's his call. I'd steer clear of your brother for a few days if I \r\nwere you. Good day. ",
        "Ian: Oh. ",
        "Eve: Michael, that was a mistake. ",
        "Ian: You just let him get away with murder. ",

        "Dara: Your what? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm writing a movie, and I just need to know all kinds of stuff \r\nabout death stuff. Come on in. Sit down. ",

        "Dara: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: You know. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so here's my story. There's this person who's dead and cold and \r\ncomes back to life again after he's been buried. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I keep telling her you know nothing about stuff like that, so --\r\n",
        "Dara: You know what? Actually, I do. I had the scare of my life one night \r\ntalking to the coroner. There was this guy laying on the table with a toe tag. \r\nAll of a sudden, he just sat up and opened his eyes right before the autopsy was \r\nabout to begin. Whoo. ",
        "Alison: Whoa. ",
        "Jamal: You're kidding, right? ",
        "Dara: No, I'm not kidding. It was a diabetic coma. I mean, his vitals were \r\noff the bottom of the chart. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so then it could happen. A person could be cold and dead and \r\nburied and come back to life again. ",
        "Dara: Once he's buried and he's embalmed, it's pretty much over. ",
        "Alison: Ok, what if it wasn't really a real burial, you know, like, official \r\n-- ",
        "Jamal: Ok, Ali, let's -- ",
        "Alison: And the person was cold and really just clawed his way out of the \r\ncoffin and just came back and had this super X-men strength? ",
        "Dara: And what if this isn't about a screenplay? ",
        "Jamal: What are you talking about? ",
        "Dara: I'm talking about the kind of trouble that you and Miss Hollywood here \r\nseem to get into once every week since you've been together, cuz. Now, what's \r\ngoing on? Don't give me a line about a screenplay, ok? What are you two up to \r\nnow? ",

        "Chris: Well, he's not dead now. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, well, coming back from the dead is just the beginning. Wait till \r\nyou hear what he did last night. ",
        "Chris: Will this story have princes and fairy godmothers? Maybe a little \r\ntroll that lives under a bridge. I like those. It makes stories interesting. ",
        "Sam: My friends are gone. They left town. You want to know why? ",
        "Chris: The suspense is killing me. ",
        "Sam: Because your lone little brother went super-commando and left them all \r\nfor dog meat in an alley. ",
        "Chris: Must be a really tough group you run with. What, do you ride mopeds?\r\n",
        "Sam: This is no joke. He wiped up the sidewalk with three guys twice his \r\nsize. They scraped up the leftovers and booked, man. They're not coming back. I \r\ngot no backup. I'm scared he'll come after me next. ",
        "Chris: Well, if I were you, I'd be on my way out of town, as well. ",

        "Lucy: Yeah, that's the only possible explanation is maybe something did \r\nhappen to you in those woods. ",
        "Jack: Like the same thing that happened with Victor's friend. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah. His name is Judge Kurland, and he was kind of acting like \r\nyou. He went crazy, very strange. ",
        "Jack: Maybe -- maybe something stung me. Maybe there's some poison in me or \r\nsomething. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. ",

        "Chris: Yeah. It's usually lyme disease, but we need to run a few tests just \r\nto make sure -- ",

        "Jack: No, no. No, I'm through. I'm through donating. ",

        "Dara: Not the way you're describing it. You're talking about a zombie, ok? A \r\ncorpse rising up out of the grave with the strength of a hundred. You know what? \r\nYou guys should check out \"Twilight Zone,\" \"Tales from the Crypt,\" \"Outer \r\nLimits\" -- that's the only place you're going to find a case like this. ",
