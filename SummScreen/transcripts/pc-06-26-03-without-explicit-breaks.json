        "Frank is persistent in his efforts to make Karen understand that they belong together forever. He reminds her that although he didn't ask to become a vampire, that's exactly what he is. Karen points out that the same thing happened to Ian, but he chooses to fight it instead of embracing it the way Frank does. Frank confronts her about her relationship with Kevin, and she tells him that they shared one kiss out of loneliness. Not seeing any reason for Karen to be lonely, Frank is ready to turn her so that they can be together forever. He lowers his mouth onto her neck, but before he can bite her, the terrified woman gets away. While trying to follow her, Frank sees photos of the two of them during happier times and suddenly feels remorse. Karen runs to the street but falls and hurts her foot, which renders her unable to get out of the way of an approaching car. At the hospital, Chris produces a copy of Lucy's living will, which Ian blatantly ignores. After getting a phone call from Christina, Kevin rushes to the hospital to find out why his little girl's mommy won't wake up. He barges into the treatment room and demands to know what's happening to his wife. Ian tries to get rid of him, but Kevin refuses to go anywhere until he hears the truth. He is appalled to hear that they are planning to use an angel's blood to save Lucy. When he threatens to remove Ian from the case and instead call in a specialist, Ian grabs him by the neck, his eyes glowing red with a vampire's rage. After stabbing \"Joshua\" five times, Alison flees in terror. She is stunned when Joshua turns up very much alive. Realizing that she actually stabbed Rafe, Alison rushes to his side. Joshua drags his hysterical bride away when he hears someone coming. He takes her back to his place, where he tells her to accept the fact that she killed Rafe. Alison accuses Joshua of doing something to make her do the unthinkable. Joshua tries to convince her that she killed Rafe of her own free will. After checking Rafe's neck for a pulse, Caleb looks very solemn."
