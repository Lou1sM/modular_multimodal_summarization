        "After finding the wounded slayer, Caleb gloats about being right again while Rafe was wrong. He takes Rafe back to the loft, where he and Olivia tend to the slayer's stab wounds. Rafe believes that Caleb is only helping him in order to maintain the balance of good and evil, since they're not certain what will happen if one of them dies. He tries to go to Alison, but he doesn't make it past the door before collapsing. Caleb advises him to help himself first, because if he dies, there won't be anyone to save Alison. Although Joshua tries to convince her otherwise, Alison maintains that she never wanted to hurt Rafe. Joshua gives her some time alone with Jamal, expecting to be notified when she's ready to take full responsibility for the slayer's death. As she tries to explain what happened, her watch alarm sounds again, causing her to see Joshua's face instead of Jamal's. Confused by Alison's strange behavior, Jamal suspects that Joshua is behind what happened to Rafe. He removes her watch and tries to get her out of there immediately, but Joshua catches them before they can leave. After ordering Frank to get rid of Jamal, Joshua informs Alison that she will spend eternity knowing that she is responsible for the deaths of the two men who loved her most--other than him. Chris tranquilizes Kevin to get him out of the way more safely than anything Ian would do. He promises to continue helping Ian but points out that they don't happen to have any angel blood on hand. Elizabeth tracks Kevin down at the hospital and finds him in restraints. She completely misinterprets the situation, thinking that he and Karen are up to something kinky. She refuses to set him loose until he informs her that he needs to get to his dying wife. Devastated over losing Casey a second time, Ricky goes to talk to Karen about it. He is shocked when a battered and bleeding Karen tells him that a car came out of nowhere. Colleen pulls Chris and Ian away when Karen is brought to the hospital. Despite their best efforts, Karen flat lines and can't be revived. Devastated, Chris spends a few moments alone with his friend. He tells her that she was very special and that he always wanted to be more like her. While Ian is with Lucy, a smiling Karen appears at the foot of the bed. Only Lucy can see her angel, whom she now realizes is Karen."

        "Rafe: If I'm going to die out here, I'd rather do it alone. I don't want you standing over me telling me, \"I told you so.\"",

        "Livvie: Caleb?",
        "Caleb: We got company.",

        "Caleb: Yeah, as predicted.",

        "Caleb: Yeah.",
        "Livvie: Stop whining, ok? You got to hold still. You're lucky he's even helping you.",
        "Rafe: Lucky? The only reason that he's trying to save me is the same reason that I saved him when we were trapped in that villa by Joshua.",

        "Livvie: Ok, I think he's delirious right now.",
        "Rafe: The universe has a good way of balancing everything out, you know? Like if one of us dies, we don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. If one of us dies, the other one might end up dying, and then you'll end up back in hell where you belong. That's the real reason you're trying to save me, isn't it? Just to save your own miserable life, right?",

        "Joshua: My poor lamb. I do sympathize with your pain, but this is all a little too noisy for my very delicate ears, I'm going to pop out and take care of some low-volume business while you purge yourself with Jamal. Now, Jamal, can you calm her down organically, or shall I whip her up a little potion?",
        "Jamal: Organically.",
        "Joshua: All right. Well, you let me know when she's taken full responsibility for the slayer's death, and then I will come back and I will comfort her tortured soul in my own special way. You know, spilt milk, under the bridge, etc. Life does go on.",

        "Alison: We were in the woods, and he was telling me how much he loves me, and -- I don't know.",
        "Jamal: Come on, I know you can do this. Stop, come on. What happened next?",
        "Alison: I was talking to him, and I was looking at his face, and he was telling me how much he loved me, and then all of a sudden it was Joshua's face. That's all I could see. And he was telling me that he wasn't going to let me go and I was going to stay with him forever. I wanted to run, but I didn't know what else to do.",
        "Jamal: Ok. What next? Was that it?",
        "Alison: No. Next thing I knew, I was -- I was stabbing him over and over. I thought it was Joshua, but then I looked down and it was Rafe and he was in a pool of blood. I would never do something like that. Why would I do something like that?",
        "Jamal: Alison, I know you couldn't have done anything like that. Not you, not by yourself.",
        "Alison: What?",

        "Alison: Oh, God, Jamal. I would never do something like this.",
        "Jamal: I know.",
        "Alison: But Joshua kept on saying that maybe for some reason, like, I would want that in the back of my mind. But you know me. I would never do that, not to Rafe.",
