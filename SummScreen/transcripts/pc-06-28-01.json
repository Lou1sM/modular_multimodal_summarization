        "Ian: Why don't you let me take over there for a while? ",
        "Michael: You two just don't quit, do you? ",
        "Eve: Uh-uh. ",
        "Michael: I know why you're here. I don't need you to protect me from my own \r\nbrother. ",
        "Eve: And when was he going to let you out of the cellar? ",
        "Michael: He would've come back. ",
        "Eve: Before or after you starved to death? ",
        "Michael: He wouldn't have let that happen. But I am glad you two showed up \r\nwhen you did. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, so are we. ",
        "Michael: I -- sort of meant to ask you -- what were you doing here in the \r\nfirst place? You never did say. ",
        "Eve: Well, actually, we came here to tell you that we're getting married. ",
        "Michael: Well, that's the best news I've heard in a long time. I'm very happy \r\nfor you, both of you. When's the big day? ",
        "Ian: Well, that's kind of up to you. ",
        "Michael: Me? ",
        "Ian: We'd like you to perform the ceremony. ",
        "Michael: I can't. I'm sorry, but I -- I can't marry you. ",
        "",
        "Deneice: Since when did you start making house calls? ",
        "Chris: You know me -- always dedicated, day or night. ",
        "Deneice: How rich is she? ",
        "Chris: Nice thought, but, actually, I'm just restocking my bag. I like to \r\nkeep it in the trunk of my car. ",
        "Deneice: Maybe you should make a house call on that brother of yours. What is \r\nwrong with that boy, anyway? ",
        "Chris: Besides being my brother? ",
        "Deneice: Even that doesn't explain it. He ripped a fire extinguisher right \r\nout of the wall. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, I know. I was there. ",
        "Deneice: Well, whatever's wrong with him, if you could bottle that kind of \r\nmuscle, you'd make a million. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Ok, here we are and in full regalia. So now what? Skunk? ",
        "Lucy: No, nothing that earthly. ",
        "Kevin: Hold it. If you're suggesting what happened to Jack and to Victor's \r\nfriend Abe out here was the result of an alien abduction -- ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, but we can't rule out anything. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, that's it. I'm out of here. ",
        "Lucy: No, you're not. No, you're not. I'm not saying it's something from \r\nouter space. ",
        "Kevin: Well, at least we agree on that. ",
        "Lucy: Right. I think it's something much more diabolical. ",
        "Kevin: Right. Whatever it was turned Abe into a madman. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, so now's the time. We have to find out exactly what happened out \r\nhere. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, the police have been all over these woods. ",
        "Lucy: I know, Doc, but it's something that those conventional kind of methods \r\njust aren't going to find. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm going to hate myself for asking this, but just what kind of \r\nunconventional methods do you have in mind? ",
        "Lucy: We are going to summon the evil spirit. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Why didn't I tell Jack the truth? What happened to me wasn't really \r\njust a dream. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: Welcome home, Olivia. ",
        "Livvie's Voice: What is this place? ",
        "Caleb's Voice: This place is where nothing else matters but you and me. Whatever you \r\nmight want, I can give to you. ",
        "Livvie's Voice: You -- you mean you want me to stay? ",
        "Caleb's Voice: I'd never force you to stay. I want you to think of me as your \r\nprotector. You know me, Olivia. I'm the one you've been waiting for your whole \r\nlife. ",
        "Livvie: God. I won't let him get to me. I won't. ",
        "Livvie: Alison. Hi, it's me. Can you see me? Great. I'm going to pick you up \r\nin a few minutes, ok? And can you please, please not tell Jamal about this? Ok, \r\nthanks. Bye. Jack. ",
        "Jack: What's going on? ",
        "",
        "Ian: You won't marry us? ",
        "Michael: I'm really sorry. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but you said that you were really happy for us. ",
        "Michael: Oh, Eve, I am happy for you. This is a bad time for me. There's so \r\nmuch to do here. ",
        "Ian: So much? Come on. ",
        "Michael: I can't lie to you two. I can't marry you because of my brother. I \r\ncan't marry you because of Caleb. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: So, this is, what, witchcraft? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I'm not a witch. You would know if I was a witch. ",
        "Kevin: Thank heavens for that. ",
        "Lucy: But I like witches. Some of my best friends are witches. You know, in \r\nfact, witches have gotten a really bad rap over the centuries. There's so many \r\n-- ",
        "Kevin: Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, all right. I guess you kind of want to know what my plan is here.\r\n",
        "Kevin: That would help. Ow! Ooh! ",
        "Lucy: Ooh, watch out. Don't move that! Don't move that! Leave it down there. \r\nOk, this is not really a spell. What I'm trying to do is transcend to the astral \r\nplane. ",
        "Kevin: Where the evil spirits lurk? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think the Stranger card and the evil spirit may be \r\none and the same. You know that card that was in my deck? ",
        "Kevin: The one that Ian somehow got a hold of? ",
        "Lucy: Right. Well, I think the stranger, the evil spirit, is somehow lurking \r\nin these woods, and so I'm going to use the astral plane, also known as the \r\notherworld, to summon that evil spirit. ",
        "Kevin: That's the simplified version? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. But, Doc, here, just come here. You have to stand inside this \r\ncircle. ",
        "Kevin: Why? ",
        "Lucy: Well, because if and when the evil spirit shows him or herself, I just \r\ndon't want you to be susceptible to their powers. ",
        "Kevin: Thanks, but I'll take my chances. ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm serious, Doc. This whole thing is a lot more diabolical than we \r\ncan know. ",
        "Kevin: I'm not disputing that. It's just that while you're summoning and \r\ntranscending and all that, I'm going to go have a look around. We're not far \r\nfrom where Victor and Abe were fishing, so you'll be all right here? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'm not the one you need to worry about. I'm worried about you. \r\nYou -- you have to be careful. ",
        "Kevin: \"Careful\" is my middle name. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok. Ok. ",
        "Lucy: All righty, then. Let's rock. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Where are you going? ",
        "Livvie: Well, I thought you were sleeping, so I was going to go see Alison \r\nfor a little while. ",
        "Jack: But you told her not to tell Jamal. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. That's because they got into a fight, and Alison needs some \r\ngirl talk, you know? ",
        "Jack: Well, maybe Alison should talk to Jamal. ",
        "Livvie: That's exactly what I was going to tell her. So are you feeling any \r\nbetter? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Are you sure? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm just probably going to go hang out for a while, go back to my \r\nplace. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, don't go. Stay here. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I don't know. This -- ",
        "Livvie: Hey, Jack -- I'm not afraid to be with you, ok? Last night was really \r\ngreat. ",
        "Jack: I love you so much. ",
        "Livvie: And I love you. And I wouldn't go if I didn't have to, ok? ",
        "Jack: Ok. Well, no worries. I'll be ok. ",
        "Livvie: And I'll be back in a little while. ",
        "Jack: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Jack: Oh, man. ",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Jack: What do you want? ",
        "Chris: I came to see you. I waited till Livvie left. ",
        "Jack: Well, I have nothing to say to you. ",
        "Chris: Good, then I'll do all the talking. I'm here to make you an offer, \r\nsomething just between you and me. ",
        "Jack: Well, there is no \"you and me.\" ",
        "Chris: We are brothers. ",
        "Jack: Since when has that meant anything to you, Chris? ",
        "Chris: All right, fair enough. But I really do want to help you. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I don't need your help. ",
        "Chris: What if I told you that maybe I could help figure out what's wrong \r\nwith you? ",
        "Jack: And what do I have to do? ",
        "Chris: Just agree to be my own personal science experiment. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Thanks for coming. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, sure. It really wasn't that easy, though, because Jamal had all \r\nthis stuff for me to do at the shop. ",
        "Livvie: You didn't say anything to him, did you? ",
        "Alison: No, no, I didn't. I told him that we were going to Wyndham's to go \r\nshopping. Uh, why did you bring me here? ",
        "Livvie: I have to show you something.",
        "Alison: In there? Yeah -- no, I don't think so. This place is creeping me \r\nout, and I want to go. ",
        "Livvie: No. No, please, not yet. Look, remember that guy I told you about?\r\n",
        "Alison: The one who's been watching you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. He brought me here. ",
        "Alison: You went with him? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Look, I just -- I knew it would be ok somehow. Look -- ",
        "Alison: Well, what happened when he brought you here? ",
        "Livvie: He told me that we belong together. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, this guy is a freak, and you need to stay away from him. ",
        "Livvie: I know. That's the problem. I don't think I can. I can't get him off \r\nof my mind. ",
        "Alison: But you are in love with Jack. ",
        "Livvie: I know, and I don't know why this is happening. That's why I want to \r\ncome here and tell him to leave me alone so I can stop thinking about him. ",
        "Alison: Well, can you say \"restraining order?\" Look, I think we should just \r\ngo to the police -- ",
        "Livvie: No! No. We are going to do this my way. If you don't want to go in \r\nthere, I'll go by myself. ",
        "Alison: No, I'll go with you. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Come on. ",
        "Alison: I'm coming. Ew. Uh, Livvie? ",

        "Alison: Are you sure? ",
        "Livvie: I'm positive! ",
        "",
        "Ian: How would your brother stop you from marrying us? ",
        "Michael: Caleb and I are mirror images of each other. I look at him, I see \r\nmyself. ",
        "Eve: You are not your brother, Michael. ",
        "Michael: He's every bit a part of me as I am him. ",
        "Eve: Then the good in you is also in him. ",
        "Michael: It's not enough, Eve. That's why I'm here -- to try to help my \r\nbrother rid the demons that seem to drive him. Until I do that, I -- I can't \r\nleave here, not -- not for anything. I hope you can understand. ",
        "Ian: There's nothing we can do to change your mind? ",
        "Michael: I'm sorry, no. But I want you to know that they say a holy place is \r\nnot truly blessed until it's been touched by love. Your love has brightened this \r\ndarkness. I can't imagine being more blessed. Well, for that I thank you. If \r\nyou'll excuse me. ",

        "Jack: You're walking now. ",
        "Chris: Are you afraid to figure out what's wrong with you? ",
        "Jack: There's nothing wrong. ",
        "Chris: You're sick, Jack. You're spiking a fever, yet you still have the \r\nstrength to rip someone's head off with your bare hands like you almost did \r\nmine. ",
        "Jack: There's your explanation. ",
        "Chris: Wait. That biker girl -- Sam? She told me about your little run-in \r\nwith her buddies, how you wiped them all out. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I need a reason for that, too, Chris? ",
        "Chris: You know something's happening to you, and everybody can see it. ",
        "Jack: Even if there was, why would I go to you for help? ",
        "Chris: Because I'm your best bet about now. ",
        "Jack: What's in it for you? ",
        "Chris: Money. A lot of money. And before you say anything -- I'll cut you in.\r\n",
        "Jack: I'm not interested. ",
        "Chris: All right, fair enough. Don't want to do it for money -- I respect \r\nthat. But what about Livvie? ",
        "Jack: What about her? ",
        "Chris: You're out of control, little brother. What happens if, next time, you \r\nlose it on her? ",
        "Jack: I won't. ",
        "Chris: Are you sure? Are you absolutely, positively sure she won't get hurt? \r\nCome on, Jack. I help you, you help me. Isn't that what brothers do?",
        "",
        "Ian: You know, we could still get married without Michael. ",
        "Eve: I wasn't thinking that. ",
        "Ian: What were you thinking? ",
        "Eve: The first time I saw Michael here, he was kneeling at that altar, \r\npraying. And the sun was coming in through the stained glass windows right on \r\nhim, like God was smiling on him. ",
        "Ian: Well, he probably was. ",
        "Eve: He was so at peace. And it hit me in that moment what a meaningful life \r\nhe has. I mean, here he is out in the middle of nowhere, and he has a more \r\nfulfilling life than anyone I've ever met. I mean, look at this place. He has \r\nworked so hard to make this place special, sacred. And now he has to deal with \r\nhis brother. ",
        "Ian: There's nothing we can do to help him. ",
        "Eve: I don't know about that. Do you remember when he said that he couldn't \r\nimagine this place being more blessed? ",
        "Ian: What do you mean? ",
        "Eve: Let's do it. Let's get married right here, tonight. ",
