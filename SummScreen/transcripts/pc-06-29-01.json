        "Ian: Are you sure about this? ",
        "Eve: Getting married? ",
        "Ian: Right here, right now. ",
        "Eve: I have never been more sure about anything in my whole life. ",

        "[Noise] ",
        "Alison: What was that noise? ",
        "Livvie: Caleb? Hey, Caleb, is that you? ",
        "Alison: Ok, I don't think so. Let's go. ",
        "[Noise] ",
        "Alison: There it is again. ",
        "Livvie: Shh! ",
        "Alison: Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: Come on. ",
        "Alison: You take one more step and -- oh, God! Jamal. Oh, you scared us. We \r\nthought you were some psycho. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, don't be too relieved. You're about to wish I had been.\r\n",
        "",
        "Chris: What did you say? ",
        "Jack: I said I have an uncontrollable urge to kill. ",
        "Chris: Jack, come on. ",
        "Jack: What you got there, Chris? ",
        "Chris: I already told you. We're going to draw a little blood, figure out \r\nwhat's wrong with you. ",
        "Jack: No. No, there's something else in that syringe. What is it? ",
        "Chris: No, it's ok. I mean, it's just -- ",
        "Jack: What the hell are you trying to do to me? ",
        "Chris: Jack, just take it easy. It's -- ah! Ah! ",
        "Jack: What's in the needle, Chris? ",
        "Chris: Jack, let go of my hand. You're breaking it. For God's sakes -- ah!\r\n",
        "",
        "Eve: You did all this? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Nervous energy. We can change it if you don't like it. ",
        "Eve: No, no, no. It's absolutely perfect. ",
        "Ian: We're still missing one thing. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- don't worry. He'll be here. I know for a fact he comes in here \r\nevery night at this time to pray. ",
        "Ian: Let's just hope he agrees. ",
        "Eve: He will. Don't worry. There he is. ",
        "Ian: Ahem. ",
        "Michael: What's -- what's going on here? Eve, where'd you get that dress? ",
        "Eve: Well, I got it down in the cellar. I thought that it would be perfect \r\nfor our wedding. ",
        "Michael: Your wedding? ",
        "Eve: Yes. Ian and I thought that we would get married right here, tonight.\r\n",
        "Ian: Yeah, if we can convince you to perform the ceremony. ",
        "Eve: Right. We know that you said that you didn't want to do it in Port \r\nCharles because you didn't want to leave your brother alone here. ",
        "Ian: That's why we thought we'd stay right here. ",
        "Eve: Right. And we already have the license. We've written our vows. And what \r\ncould be more perfect than you marrying us right here? The only thing you have \r\nto do is say yes. ",
        "Michael: Yes. ",
        "Eve: I mean, you yourself said that this place could not be more blessed \r\nwithout the true love -- did you just say yes? ",
        "Michael: Yes. I think that's a wonderful idea. ",
        "Eve: Oh! Oh, thank you, father. Thank you so much. Yay. ",
        "Ian: I can't tell you how much we appreciate it. Thank you. ",
        "Michael: An occasion as -- as happy as this one -- it's exactly what we need \r\nhere. ",
        "Ian: Ok, well, let's get on with it. ",
        "Michael: Yes. Let's get on with it. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Alison, what are you thinking? You did exactly what I told you not to \r\ndo. ",
        "Alison: What, you told me not to come to these caves? ",
        "Jamal: I warned you, ok, with all this crazy stuff going on not to go put \r\nyourself in some dangerous situations. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, I didn't do -- ",
        "Jamal: Well, then what are you doing down here? You and Livvie alone, at \r\nnight. ",
        "Alison: Um -- ",
        "Livvie: Jamal, it's my fault. I asked Alison to meet me here. ",
        "Jamal: Really? Alison told me you guys were supposed to be meeting at \r\nWyndham's for shopping. See, I knew something was up. ",
        "Alison: Oh, so, what, you followed me? Thanks a lot for the trust, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Well, considering, Alison, you just got caught in a lie, I don't think \r\nright now is the best time to be bringing up trust. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, the only reason why I didn't tell you is because you've been \r\nso insanely overprotective lately. I didn't want you to worry -- or try and ship \r\nme off to Nana's again. ",
        "Jamal: Just tell me what you guys are doing down here. ",
        "Alison: Um -- uh -- ",
        "Livvie: I wanted her to help me find Caleb. ",
        "Jamal: Caleb? Who's Caleb? ",
        "Livvie: That guy who's been following me. ",
        "Jamal: What, are you crazy? Livvie, why would you go looking for that creep? \r\nAnd then down here in some tomb? ",
        "Livvie: Because I came down here with him the other night. ",
        "Jamal: You what? ",
        "Livvie: Jamal, I know it sounds really stupid, but I had to find out what he \r\nwanted, why he's been following me. ",
        "Jamal: And it never occurred to you, Livvie, that you just might -- the hard \r\nway. ",
        "Livvie: I knew he wasn't dangerous. ",
        "Jamal: You can just tell this by looking at him, right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, actually, I could. And he wasn't, not at all. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, the guy is practically stalking you! I mean, come on. He's a \r\nnut case. He's crazy. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, why are you yelling? ",
        "Jamal: Because I can't seem to get it through your heads that we're in some \r\nseriously whacked-out stuff here. And right now is not the time to be taking any \r\nchances. ",
        "Livvie: What, because of Jack? Huh? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, Jack rose from the dead, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: He wasn't dead. ",
        "Jamal: And now he's running around like some incredible hulk on steroids. And \r\nnow you got some guy taking you down to some catacomb tombs and everything. ",
        "Livvie: Ok! ",
        "Jamal: God knows what his story is. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, ok. I get it. Look, things have been really crazy lately, and \r\nmaybe I haven't been thinking clearly, but I never meant to put Alison in any \r\ndanger. ",
        "Alison: Look, he knows that. Don't you, Jamal? ",
        "Jamal: Look, all right. I know you didn't mean any harm, Livvie. It's just \r\nI'm just concerned, ok? So how long has this guy been following you? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. ",
        "Jamal: What do you mean, you don't know? ",
        "Livvie: Guys, this is going to sound really weird. ",
        "Alison: What is it? ",
        "Livvie: The first time I felt someone watching me was -- was after we got \r\nback from burying Jack. ",
        "",
        "Jack: What's in the needle, Chris? ",
        "Chris: Nothing. It's a shot of vitamins. Ok! Ok! It's a sedative! ",
        "Jack: Why did you lie to me? Huh? ",
        "Chris: Because you're out of control. I just wanted to help you relax, that's \r\nall. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no. You were trying to drug me up so you can use me as one of \r\nyour lab rats. ",
        "Chris: No, it's not true. ",
        "Jack: Well, forget about it, all right, because our deal's off. I'm not going \r\nto be your little science project, so stay the hell away from me. ",
        "Chris: Jack, you're making a mistake, ok? You said it yourself -- you need \r\nhelp. ",
        "Jack: The only mistake I made was trusting you, Chris. ",
        "Chris: No, your behavior's not normal. You are not normal. ",
        "Jack: Shut the hell up! ",
        "Chris: Jack, you beat up a bunch of guys by yourself to within an inch of \r\ntheir life. Then you attack me twice in one week. ",
        "Jack: No. No, they came after me, just like you did, and I was defending \r\nmyself. ",
        "Chris: I wasn't going to hurt you. The sedative is harmless. ",
        "Jack: If it's so harmless, then you take it. ",
        "Chris: Jack, no. Jack -- Jack -- ",
        "Livvie: Jack! What are you doing? Stop. ",
        "Alison: What is going on? ",
        "Jamal: Jack, what did you do to him? ",
        "Jack: I don't know. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Chris. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I saw you. Your hands were wrapped around his throat. ",
        "Jamal: He's still breathing. What happened? ",
        "Jack: I don't know. He tried to drug me. ",
        "Alison: Drug you? ",
        "Jack: Yes, with a sedative. But instead, I gave it back to him. ",
        "Livvie: Jack. ",
        "Alison: No, Livvie, don't! Come here! ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, Livvie, stay away from him. ",
        "Alison: Stay away from him. ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. You're scared of me. My own friends are scared of me. ",
        "Jamal: There's something wrong with you, bro. ",
        "Jack: Don't you think I know that? ",
        "Livvie: Jack, we'll help you. Whatever it is, we will help. ",
        "Jack: No, no. No, that's what Chris tried to do. No one can. ",
        "Livvie: Jack! ",
        "Alison: Livvie! ",
        "Jamal: No, don't. ",
        "Livvie: God, he needs me! ",
        "Alison: Livvie -- he's -- ",
        "Livvie: He's not himself, ok? ",
        "Jamal: He's dangerous. ",
        "Livvie: No! ",
        "Jamal: You saw for yourself. ",
        "Livvie: I can't let him go through this alone. We abandoned him once before \r\nand left him in that -- in that cold, dark hole. I won't do it again. ",
        "Alison: Livvie! But, Livvie! Jamal, Jamal, I am scared. There is something \r\nseriously wrong here. What is going on? ",
        "Jamal: You know, I wish I knew. I wish I knew. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I am the luckiest man in the world. ",
        "Michael: We have come together tonight for the holiest of occasions. There \r\nare only two institutions created by God and addressed in Scripture -- the \r\nchurch and marriage. That alone speaks of the promise of the sacred bond -- the \r\nsacred promise between two people in love. God bless you, Eve and Ian and the \r\nchild created by your rare and precious love. ",
        "Ian: Thank you, Father. ",
        "Eve: Thank you, Father. ",
        "Michael: Ian and Eve, you stand before God and each other to enter into the \r\nhallowed institution of marriage. I realize how long you've waited for this \r\nmoment. So without further ado, you may proceed with your vows. ",
        "Eve: Ahem. First of all, I can't believe we're really here. Part of me \r\nwondered if it was too good to be true. But then I look in your eyes, and I know \r\nthat we were meant to be through the ages. You are my shelter. I find comfort \r\nand refuge in your love. Now, I may make some mistakes along the way because we \r\nboth know I'm not perfect. But I can promise you all of me, for better, for \r\nworse. And I will be by your side through the good times and the bad times and \r\neverything in between. And I promise to cherish you. I love you, now and for \r\nalways. ",
        "Ian: When I met you, the first thing I noticed -- or the second thing I \r\nnoticed -- was that your eyes seemed to dance when you're angry. Now when I look \r\ninto your eyes, I see so much more. I see a woman of tremendous strength, of \r\ncompassion, humor and generosity. And I see a woman that has taught me not to \r\ngive up on love. And now for the first time in my life -- for the first time -- \r\nI have found a peace and a calm that I didn't know existed. I found it in you. \r\nNow I promise you that I will be the best husband, best father, the best man \r\nthat I could possibly be, and I promise that I will love you and honor you with \r\neverything that is me, for now and for always. ",
        "Michael: What God has joined together, let no man put asunder. I now \r\npronounce you husband and wife. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Well, it's a good thing we have our trusty little rental cabin. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: It would have been a little inhibiting spending our wedding night in a \r\nmonastery. ",
        "Ian: That wouldn't have worked at all, would it? Uh-uh. Ok. ",
        "Eve: Whoa, what are you -- what are you doing? Whoa. ",
        "Ian: I'm carrying my bride over the threshold. ",
        "Eve: Well, ok, but aren't you supposed to do that in our own home? ",
        "Ian: I just did. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: I bought the place. The cabin is officially ours. ",
        "Eve: This cabin is ours? ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. I can't believe it. ",
        "Ian: It was supposed to be an engagement gift, but, well, now it's a wedding \r\npresent. ",
        "Eve: Oh, I can't think of a better present. Oh, this night has been so \r\nperfect. Our wedding. And now this cabin. This cabin. ",
        "Ian: You didn't mind the simple ceremony? ",
        "Eve: Oh, please. I am so ready for simple. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. So am I. ",
        "Eve: All I want is you and our baby. ",
        "Ian: Uh-huh. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. Whoa. ",
        "[Eve squeals] ",
        "Ian: You have the most beautiful and amazing mother in the world! ",
        "Eve: Oh, gosh. I am so -- so happy. I don't want this feeling or this moment \r\nto end ever. ",
        "Ian: Oh, we're going to have feelings and moments like this for the rest of \r\nour lives. Happy wedding day, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: That is Lambert-Thornhart to you. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",

        "Jamal: Oh, man. ",
        "Alison: Jamal? Jamal, he's not coming to. Chris? Wake up! ",
        "Jamal: Maybe we should call 911. ",
        "Alison: But if we do, then we're going to have to tell them what happened, \r\nand then Jack's going to get in trouble. Chris? Chris? ",
        "Jamal: He'll be in more trouble if something happens to this guy. ",
        "Alison: Well, like what? It was just a sedative. Come on. ",
        "Jamal: What if he gave him too much, though? ",
        "Alison: I don't think so because there's still a lot left. ",
        "Jamal: Jeez. ",
        "Alison: Chris, come on. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we got to do something. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, where are you going? ",
        "Jamal: I've got an idea. ",
        "Alison: Chris, Chris, please wake up. Look, Jack didn't mean to do what he \r\ndid, ok? He's just scared, just like us. You got to wake up, ok? Please! Jamal, \r\nwhat are you doing? You're going to pour water on him? ",
        "Jamal: No, I thought he was thirsty, ok? Yeah, of course I am. ",
        "Alison: Well, do you think it's going to work? ",
        "Jamal: Well, we're going to find out. Watch out. ",
        "Alison: Chris? Oh, God. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, Jamal. He's still not waking up. ",

        "Jack: What are you doing here? ",
        "Livvie: I couldn't just let you go like that. ",
        "Jack: No, you should have. I told you to stay away. ",
        "Livvie: If you really didn't want me to find you, you wouldn't have come \r\nhere. Besides, I'm not afraid of you, Jack. I know you would never hurt me. ",

        "Livvie: Jack -- ",
        "Jack: Livvie, don't you get it? If you wouldn't have shown up when you did, I \r\nwould have killed him. I would have killed my own brother. ",
        "Livvie: He must have done something. He must have provoked you somehow. ",
        "Jack: No. It was me. Something snapped and I tried to kill him. And then -- \r\nthen I tried -- ",
