        "Kevin: I can't believe it, I'm home! ",
        "Lucy: I can't believe it, either. Listen, I never thought I'd see you again. \r\nI didn't think I would ever touch you like this or hold you. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know, I know. I know the feeling. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, tell me everything. Where were you? What -- wait a minute. That \r\ndoesn't matter. Hold on. Come here. ",
        "Kevin: Ow! ",
        "Lucy: Ooh -- ",
        "Kevin: You pinched me! ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I -- I just had to pinch you to make sure you're real. You \r\nare real. I didn't imagine -- you are home. Ow! ",
        "Kevin: Do you know I'm real now? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I do. ",
        "Kevin: Well, then get over here. You're too far away. ",

        "Livvie: Where are you, Rafe? ",
        "Livvie's Voice: So you read the love story I wrote in my private little \r\ndiary. Hot stuff, huh? If this doesn't convince you you're head-over-heels in \r\nlove with me, nothing will. ",
        "Livvie: It's a story that's come true. I've fallen in love with you, Rafe. \r\nCome home to me so we can start the rest of our life together. Now that I \r\nfinally got you away from Alison. ",

        "Alison: Rafe? ",
        "Rafe: You know me. ",
        "Alison: Rafe -- ",
        "Alison: Did I die? Is that what happened? Did I go to heaven? ",
        "Rafe: No, I don't think so. ",
        "Alison: So you're really here. You're really back with me? Oh, my God. I \r\nmissed you so much. I missed you so much. Thank you, dear God, for bringing me \r\none of your angels. ",
        "Rafe: You all right? ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, how long can you stay? ",
        "Rafe: \"Stay?\" I don't even know why I'm here in the first place. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: I mean, I was in the hospital and I walked in the door and I -- I saw \r\nyour face. I've seen it in my dreams and I just -- I -- I kissed you. I'm sorry. \r\nI don't know why. I -- ",
        "Alison: It's because you -- you missed me as much as I've missed you. ",
        "Rafe: How can that be? I don't even know you. ",

        "Kevin: Oh, let me -- let me just look at you. I thought I'd never see this \r\nbeautiful face again. Lucy, it's all right, I'm home. I'm home. ",
        "Lucy: I know. It's just when they told me you were missing, it's like a part \r\nof me had just died. And then to think some ghost had a 100-year-old grudge and \r\nlit a candle and made you leave and vanish -- ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Rebecca pulled me right through that portrait. I found myself in \r\nthis -- it was like an enchanted limbo. I was trying so hard to make any kind of \r\ncontact with you. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you did. You -- you did make contact through Ian. ",
        "Kevin: Ian? ",
        "Lucy: Yes. Somehow, he -- he talked like you or he kind of could feel what \r\nyou were feeling. ",
        "Kevin: But how? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. Maybe it's because we're such good friends or because \r\nlosing Eve was still so close to the surface. But, Doc, that's how I know you \r\nwere with Rebecca. ",
        "Kevin: After a while I was starting to wonder if I was making any contact at \r\nall or if it was -- it was just all in my head. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I tried to hold on to hope for so long and then when there was \r\nso much evidence that you were murdered -- I started believing the worst. ",
        "Kevin: I married you. I married you for life. You think I'm going to cut out \r\nafter six months? ",
        "Lucy: No. Oh, Doc. We were just so very lucky we got through all of this. I \r\nwish I could say the same for Alison. ",
        "Kevin: Rebecca told me Alison was arrested for my murder? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but things have gotten even worse. ",
        "Kevin: Do you have a phone with you? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, oh. Yeah, I -- I wanted to keep it in case I heard any news. Why? \r\nWhat are you going to do? ",
        "Kevin: I'm going to call the D.A. and tell him he needs to let Alison out of \r\njail. ",
        "Lucy: What -- no, Doc. It really isn't quite that simple. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Rafe? It's me. Of course it's me. It's Alison. ",
        "Rafe: But no -- no. I -- I met Alison. You're not her. ",
        "Alison: My God. Do you not remember? You have to remember. ",
        "Jamal: Alison. Alison? Oh, my God. I can't believe it. ",

        "Ian: Alison, you're awake? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: What happened? ",
        "Alison: I was -- I was just -- ",
        "Jack: Wow. ",
        "Alison: I was sleeping and then I was dreaming, and Rafe woke me up. ",
        "Jack: Dude, I knew if you showed up you could help her. This is, like -- ",
        "Rafe: You wanted me to come here? ",
        "Alison: I really need -- I need to talk to you. ",
        "Ian: Hang on. You just relax, ok? ",
        "Alison: But, Ian, I -- ",
        "Ian: Hang on. You collapsed, you had an aneurysm. I -- I can't explain this \r\nmedically. I can't. ",
        "Alison: It's because -- it's because he came back to me. ",
        "Rafe: Alison? ",
        "Woman's Voice: Rafe! Sweetheart, did you miss me? ",
        "Livvie's Voice: What are you saying, Rafe? Of course this is Alison. ",
        "Woman's Voice: Here, sweetheart, feel. It's me. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: You know what? You can go now. ",
        "Woman's Voice: She turned you against me, Rafe. That's what feels wrong. ",
        "Livvie's Voice: Look at her, Rafe, this is Alison. She shows the world her \r\nphony sweet side all the time, but this is her. This is the real Alison. ",
        "Ian: I'm going to check your vitals. ",
        "Alison: But, Ian, please, I really -- ",
        "Ian: In a minute. ",
        "Alison: Just need to speak with Rafe. ",
        "Jamal: I got a couple of words for you, Rafe. How come you left Alison when \r\nshe need you the most? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know. ",
        "Jamal: Couldn't have said it better myself -- \"I don't know.\" ",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. I don't even remember how I got here. I -- I don't remember \r\nany of you. I had some sort of accident. I have no memory of the last several \r\nyears of my life. ",
        "Ian: Well, your vitals are stable. I -- I can't explain any of this. Give \r\nthem a minute. They need some privacy, ok? ",
        "Jamal: Call us if you need us. ",
        "Alison: Please, you got -- you got to tell me the truth. What's really going \r\non? ",
        "Rafe: I wish I could. ",
        "Alison: Oh -- oh, is that it? Do you -- is it some, like, sort of mission or \r\nsomething? Is it something special that God has sent you on or -- is it that?\r\n",
        "Rafe: Why would you ask if -- ",
        "Alison: Because I need some sort of explanation or some kind of reason as to \r\nwhy you are acting like we're such strangers. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: So Alison was testifying in court and she just collapsed and they \r\nrushed her to the hospital. ",
        "Kevin: So I came back too late to save her? ",
        "Lucy: No. No, don't do that. This is not your fault. You didn't have any \r\ncontrol over when you could come back. Wait a minute. How did you make it back?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, I thought you lit Rebecca's candle. ",
        "Lucy: Someone must've found a candle and lit it. Oh, my God. Doc, if they \r\nhadn't done that, I might've lost you forever. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I was in this -- this incredible place. I could have anything I \r\nwanted just by snapping my fingers. Except the most important thing -- I \r\ncouldn't have you. So instead I sketched picture after picture of you until my \r\nfingers were numb because I wouldn't let myself forget a single thing about you.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh. I -- I know! I haven't let this out of my sight. Look. Look at \r\nthis. I think you captured me just perfectly. ",
        "Kevin: Where did you get this? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I found it on our deck at the lighthouse. That means \r\nsomehow we are connected. ",
        "Kevin: Wow. ",
        "Victor: All right. Now, Simon says, \"Do a pretty pirouette and dance.\" Lucy, \r\nthere you are. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Victor: I hope you don't mind. It's such a lovely evening out, I decided to \r\ntake the children for a pajama scavenger hunt. Monk and Ryan used to love them. \r\nBecause you never know -- ",
        "Kevin: What you might find out there. ",

        "Livvie: What money? ",
        "Shirley: The twenty that I lent your husband? ",
        "Livvie: You lent him money? ",
        "Shirley: Yeah, for cab fare. ",

        "Livvie: Did he -- did he say where he was going? ",

        "Ian: This is amazing to me. Alison comes out of a coma because, why, Rafe was \r\nhere? ",

        "Jack: Do you think this, like, memory lapse is true or -- ",
        "Jamal: I mean, even if it is, do you think he's going to remember about him \r\nand Alison? ",
        "Ian: I don't know any of that. I don't know any of that. That would take a \r\nfull examination. Right now I got to concentrate on Alison. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ",
        "Ian: I'm going to get the neurologist to come down, have a look at her. He's \r\nnot going to believe this. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Wow. ",
        "Jack: This is amazing. I mean, Alison was basically at death's door, and Rafe \r\nwaking her up is like some kind of miracle. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know, I know. I mean, nobody could get through to her -- not \r\nyou, me, or her granny. ",
        "Jack: But, hey -- ",
        "Jamal: Wow. ",
        "Jack: I mean, at least she's back, right? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, that's what's important -- Alison's back. She told me how \r\nclose her and Rafe were, but -- ",

        "",
        "Rafe: I don't get it. Is this some sort of religious thing? I mean, why do \r\nyou keep asking me about God? ",
        "Alison: So then you really don't remember anything about me or being in Port \r\nCharles? ",
        "Rafe: I just woke up in the woods a few weeks ago and I don't even know how I \r\ngot there. ",
        "Alison: The last place I left you was in the park. I was holding your hand so \r\ntight, I didn't want to let you go. ",
        "Rafe: Why was I leaving you? ",
        "Alison: You didn't want to, but you had no choice because your pass was up.\r\n",
        "Rafe: My pass? Oh. Was I on leave? Was I in the military or something? ",
        "Alison: No. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. My head is really starting to spin here. ",
        "Alison: Ok, wait, just wait. Wait, listen to me. I'm sure that we can just \r\ntalk about this later, ok, because I know that you've probably got a lot of \r\nquestions and so do I. Ok, but just come here, just for a second. Just let me \r\nlook at you. Please. I just want to -- I just want to look at you because I \r\nnever thought that I would ever see you again in this lifetime. ",
        "Rafe: Why? I mean, if we were so close, why -- ",
        "Alison: All you have to remember, all you have to know, is that we really \r\nlove each other. Ok, now that you're back with me, it's all going to be ok. Now \r\nthat we have each other. Ok? ",
        "Rafe: It's not that easy. ",
