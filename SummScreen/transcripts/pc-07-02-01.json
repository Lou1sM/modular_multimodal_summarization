        "Gabriela's Voice: Oh. Sorry. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: I'm not. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: Do I know you? ",
        "Caleb's Voice: You will. Soon. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: Excuse me? ",
        "Caleb's Voice: And very, very well. ",

        "Jamal: What the -- are those teeth marks? ",
        "Alison: What are you looking at? ",
        "Jamal: Hey, stay there. ",
        "Alison: Why? What's the matter? ",
        "Jamal: I'm just -- I'm tripping because he's been out for so long. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, hopefully, these smelling salts will help. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Come on, Chris. Oh! ",
        "Jamal: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you all right, man? ",
        "[Chris coughs] ",
        "Jamal: You ok? ",
        "Chris: No, I'm not all right. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, we know something went down between you and Jack, dude. What \r\nhappened? ",
        "Chris: He attacked me, that's what happened. He was choking me, tried to bite \r\nme. He did. That freak bit me! ",
        "",
        "Jack: What do you think you are, man? ",
        "Caleb: I'll give you three guesses. ",
        "Jack: What, do you think you're a vampire? ",
        "Caleb: You're a smart boy, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Listen, I don't know what kind of games you're playing here, but I'm \r\nnot interested. All right, so stay the hell away. I got to find Livvie help. ",
        "Caleb: You're not taking her anywhere. She's fine. ",
        "Jack: No, you don't know that. ",
        "Caleb: I know everything about her. ",
        "Jack: You're crazy. Stay the hell away from her. ",
        "Caleb: Afraid that's not going to happen, Jack. You see, Olivia's my destiny. \r\nShe's going to be my bride. ",
        "",
        "Joe: I need to talk to you. ",
        "Gabriela: This isn't a good time. ",
        "Joe: Are you alone? ",
        "Gabriela: Yes, I am, but -- ",
        "Joe: I'm leaving tonight, Gabby. You owe me that much. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. ",
        "Joe: I'm assuming this isn't for me. ",
        "Gabriela: Sorry, but, no, it isn't. ",
        "Joe: Gabby -- ",
        "Gabriela: Just say what you have to say, please. ",
        "Joe: I'm worried about you. ",
        "Gabriela: Don't be. ",
        "Joe: Sorry, but you're not in charge of how I feel. Ok? Look, forget about \r\nus. Let's just talk about you -- someone I thought I knew, was ready to spend \r\nthe rest of my life with, who suddenly turned out to be a stranger overnight!\r\n",
        "Gabriela: I met someone else. ",
        "Joe: Fine, I got that. The love of your life, who you only had to meet once.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: That's right. ",
        "Joe: So, where is he? I'd like to meet this miracle man myself. ",
        "Gabriela: That's not a good idea, Joe. Trust me. You do not want to be here \r\nwhen he comes. ",
        "",
        "Chris: At least he didn't break the skin. Still, you two have a real nut job \r\non your hands. ",
        "Jamal: First things first. Jack said you tried to drug him. ",
        "Chris: A sedative. I tried to give him a sedative. ",
        "Alison: Well, what are you doing waving a needle in his face when you know \r\nJack hates you? ",
        "Chris: Trying to help him. He obviously has some serious problems. I offered \r\nto help him figure out what's wrong with him. ",
        "Alison: Like you care, Chris. ",
        "Jamal: Keep going. ",
        "Chris: I know my brother and I aren't exactly bosom buddies. Something \r\nhappened to him, something that turned a normal guy into someone who can rip \r\nbolted fixtures off a wall and throw furniture around like King Kong. I'm a \r\ndoctor. I was curious. I wanted to know why. ",
        "Jamal: So, what, Jack was, what, like a science project to you or something?\r\n",
        "Chris: Call it whatever you want. Ok, but at least I'm trying to do something \r\nfor him rather than sit around here like you two and pretend nothing's wrong.\r\n",
        "Jamal: You know, Jack doesn't need your kind of help, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Fine. Fine, if that's the way you want it. But he's out of control, \r\nand the next time he snaps -- and he will snap -- he could kill someone. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Stay the hell away from her, or I'll kill you. ",
        "Caleb: Did you forget the part about me being a vampire? You can't kill me.\r\n",
        "Jack: You're insane, man. ",
        "Caleb: Not enough proof for you? ",
        "Jack: Well, it's a nice trick. ",
        "Caleb: You're a tough sell, Jack. Truth be told, you could be one, too. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Caleb: A little bedtime story for you. Once upon a time, there was this boy \r\nnamed Jack, and he took his girlfriend camping in the woods. Jack went to look \r\nfor firewood, and he didn't come back. Any of this coming back to you? Those two \r\nor three hours you can't account for? Come on, Jack, you remember. You've just \r\nbeen trying so hard to forget. I was watching you gather wood for your fire. I \r\nstepped out to introduce myself. I was hungry. I was everywhere. You tried to \r\nrun, but you couldn't escape me. And you were fighting back so hard, I -- I just \r\ncouldn't bring myself to finish you off. So I decided to be generous and let you \r\nlive -- between two worlds, so to speak, my blood mixed with yours. Brothers, in \r\na way. It's all coming back now, isn't it? ",
        "Jack: No way. No way. ",
        "Caleb: Then give me another version, Jack. Explain how these feelings you've \r\nbeen having, these changes -- tell me how you can explain those in human terms. \r\nLook at me. You know what I'm talking about. Hmm? Heightened senses, insatiable \r\nhunger, superhuman strength. And let's not forget that neat trick of bursting \r\nout of your own grave. You can't be destroyed the normal way, Jack. Hell, you \r\nplay your cards right, you're halfway to being immortal like me. ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Caleb: Welcome to the family, Jack. Welcome to the family. ",
        "",
        "Chris: All right, I'm out of here. ",
        "Jamal: What, the sedative wore off? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, enough. Hey, you think about what I said. You can't handle Jack \r\nby yourselves. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, can you believe that guy -- using his own brother as an \r\nexperiment? And I thought my family was dysfunctional. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, he was right about one thing, though. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: Jack is seriously out of control, so we need some help figuring this \r\nout. Not from him, though. ",
        "Alison: Well, then, what are you thinking? ",
        "Jamal: There's something I got to check out. ",
        "Alison: What do you mean? Where are you going? ",
        "Jamal: Just stay here for me. ",
        "Alison: But I want to go with you. I want to help. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you being safe helps me, ok? Look, I'll call you in an hour if \r\nI'm not back. ",
        "Alison: Wait, Jamal. Why are you being so secretive? ",
        "Jamal: Look, it's not dangerous, I promise. All right, this is just something \r\nI got to, you know, check out on my own. All right? ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: All right, look, lock the door, and if Livvie shows up, only open it \r\nif she's alone. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Ok? ",
        "Alison: All right. ",
        "Jamal: Don't worry. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Alison: Don't worry? Yeah. Sure, I won't worry. Ok, my best friends are in \r\ntrouble and I'm supposed to sit here? Yeah, no, not this time. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: I want you to leave, Joe. Now. ",
        "Joe: I'm not afraid of this guy, if that's what you're worried about. ",
        "Gabriela: You don't know him. You don't know what he's capable of. There's \r\nnothing that you can do or say that will change the truth. He's opened a new \r\nlife for me. I've never felt more alive, more sure of my destiny. To be with him \r\nis -- it's everything. ",
        "Joe: Would you listen to yourself? I mean, you've met this guy once. ",
        "Gabriela: Ugh, I don't know why I bother explaining it. ",
        "Joe: Because it doesn't make sense. ",
        "Gabriela: No, because someone like you wouldn't understand. ",
        "Joe: Someone like me, who you loved not so long ago, who loved you, who still \r\nloves you. ",
        "Gabriela: I thought we weren't going to talk about us. ",
        "Joe: I lied. ",
        "Gabriela: Go. ",
        "Joe: I love you. ",
        "Gabriela: Stop saying that! ",

        "",
        "Jack: No. No, I'm not like you, whatever you are. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, come on, brother, say it with me -- a vampire. Blood is the life, \r\nJack. But then again, you've experienced that already, haven't you? ",
        "Jamal: What do you mean? ",
        "Caleb: You felt bad, then you felt better. Let's see, what changed? What did \r\nJack receive? ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. The blood transfusion. ",
        "Caleb: We have a winner. Ding, ding, ding. And it took the hunger right away, \r\ndidn't it? Because you were fed. ",
        "Jack: That's sick. You're sick. ",
        "Caleb: The munchies will come back, Jack, and there's only one way to satisfy \r\nit -- more. ",
        "Jack: I'll die first. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, that's the thing. You can't. You'll just become miserable, Jack, \r\ntill the hunger overwhelms you. And then you'll have to satisfy it with whoever \r\nhappens to be around. ",
        "Jack: You mean kill. ",
        "Caleb: I prefer \"harvesting.\" Call it as you like. But when you do kill -- \r\nand trust me, you will -- you and I will be the same. See, you can't truly \r\nbecome a vampire, Jack, until you've had your first kill. In my world, it's what \r\nseparates the men from the boys. ",
        "Jack: You're crazy, man. ",
        "Caleb: Now, if I was just your average, run-of-the-mill crazy person, could I \r\ndo this? ",
        "Alison: What are you doing, Jack? ",
        "Jack: Oh, I thought you were somebody else. ",

        "Jack: Hey, sweetie, you ok? ",
        "Alison: What happened? ",
        "Livvie: I was running, and I -- I fell. ",
        "Alison: Why didn't you get her help? ",
        "Jack: I was about to go. Come on, let's get help. Come on. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Help me. ",
        "Jack: Look, Alison, you got to get her out of here now. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack. I told you I won't abandon you. ",
        "Jack: Look, no, no, you can't stay here, all right? You can't be here. ",
        "Livvie: Please, Jack, I can help you. ",

        "Jack: I know you're still here. What do you want from me? ",
        "Caleb: It's simple, really. I want you to join me. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Let go of me, Alison. ",
        "Alison: I will once we get to the car, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Do you really think you're helping me, dragging me away from Jack?\r\n",
        "Alison: Yes, I do, ok? No, I -- I don't know. I don't know anything anymore!\r\n",
        "Livvie: Hey, you know that I love him. Remember how long it took for us to \r\nfinally admit that we belong together? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, about as long as it finally took for Jamal to stop being so \r\nafraid and tell me that he loved me. Look, Livvie, we went through some really \r\nhard stuff, too. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but once all the bad stuff was out of the way, Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was good. And it was good for you, too. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but now I'm just afraid that something is tearing us apart, and \r\nI don't know what it is. That's the worst part. I just wish that -- ",
        "Alison: That everything could be back to the way that it used to be. Remember \r\nwhen we opened up the bike shop? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Look, when I was little, I used to just look up at the stars \r\nand make a wish. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, me, too, and I believed that all of my wishes would come true. \r\nOk, go. You first. Go. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. First of all, I would just like to thank you for granting me a \r\nwish I made a really long time ago, and that was to have a really good friend \r\nthat would always be there for me. And now I just wish that Jack would start \r\nfeeling better again and he would just let me love him. ",
        "Alison: And I wish that -- that my friend would let her really, really good \r\nfriend just take her back to the car, ok, and take her home. All right, Livvie? \r\nJust -- just let me take you home, ok? That's what Jack wanted, too. You heard \r\nhim. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know, Alison, but -- ",
        "Alison: But nothing, ok? You can start putting everything together once we \r\nget in the car, ok? You can start filling in the blanks from there, all right? \r\nPlease, just come on. ",

        "Jamal: What's up, bro? ",
        "Man: Oh, hi. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",

        "Jamal: No, I'm not here for a meeting. ",
        "Man: What can I do for you? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, I just need some -- some advice, an opinion on something that's \r\nkind of trippy, you know? ",
        "Man: Well, if by \"kind of trippy\" you mean supernatural, I can help you. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Ok, I was curious. I read this story about a guy that was buried \r\nafter having a really, really, really bad accident. ",
        "Man: But he wasn't really dead or he came back to life? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I don't know, I don't know. Just all it said in the story was \r\nthat he just -- you know, he burst out of this coffin without a scratch on him. \r\nThat's it. ",
        "Man: I see. ",
        "Jamal: You see what? ",
        "Man: Finish the story. There is more, isn't there? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, there's -- it just said something about him, you know, \r\nhaving superhuman strength and -- and just beating up a bunch of guys without a \r\nproblem and just fighting like an animal all over the place and just biting \r\npeople and stuff, you know. ",
        "Man: Uh-huh. ",
        "Jamal: What do you mean, \"uh-huh?\" ",
        "Man: Happens more often than people think. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, somebody said something about him being a zombie or something.\r\n",
        "Man: That's a good one. Sorry, but there's no such thing as a zombie. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, that's what I thought. That's what I thought. Hey, do me a favor \r\n-- thanks -- just forget you ever saw me. ",
