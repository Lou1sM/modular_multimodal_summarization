        "Karen: Sorry. ",
        "Ricky: Oh, don't be. I actually was going to show you a video of our last gig \r\nthat you missed, but you just gave me a better idea. ",
        "Karen: Whoa, what are you doing? ",
        "Ricky: We are going to do our own performing. ",

        "Ian: I didn't do anything. There wasn't really anything I could do. ",
        "Kate: Then -- ",
        "Ian: Rafe. ",
        "Kate: Rafe? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. He came to her and she woke up. ",
        "Kate: He just showed up and -- ",
        "Ian: And she came to, like Sleeping Beauty. If this isn't a case of love \r\nconquering all, I don't know what is. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Did she just call you her husband? ",
        "Rafe: That's what I've been trying to tell you. ",
        "Alison: But that's impossible. You can't be married to her. ",
        "Livvie: You know Rafe and I fell in love a long time ago, Alison. ",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? You were never in love. ",
        "Livvie: You still can't accept it, can you? Rafe fell in love with me and \r\nleft you, Alison. When are you going to face it? When are you going to stop \r\npunishing us for it? ",
        "Alison: What -- what are you talking about? Are you crazy? ",
        "Livvie: That's why you did it, isn't it? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Livvie: You hated me so much for taking Rafe away that you killed my father.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Honey, she didn't kill me. I'm right here. I'm home. ",

        "Ricky: That's it. That's not bad. You've got some rhythm. ",
        "Karen: Hey, you know I do. ",
        "Ricky: We should play like this more often. ",
        "Karen: Do you ever think this is weird? ",
        "Ricky: Weird? ",
        "Karen: You know, that we ended up like this. ",
        "Ricky: You mean, together? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. I mean, we come from different places in our lives, and even \r\nthough I knew I was attracted to you, I never thought it would get this far. ",
        "Ricky: I did, once you let yourself. ",
        "Karen: So, are you saying I have hang-ups? ",
        "Ricky: Mm-hmm. But I also know that it feels as right to you as it does to \r\nme. ",
        "Karen: True. It'll be interesting to see what everybody else thinks when they \r\nfind out. ",
        "Ricky: Are you really worried about that? ",
        "Karen: No, it's just that, you know, it's been me and Frank for so long. And \r\nnow -- ",
        "Ricky: And now -- now you're with a guy who is a few months out of the pen, \r\nis a drummer in a band, and doesn't really actually have what you would call a \r\ncareer yet. ",
        "Karen: Ricky -- ",
        "Ricky: And you -- you are a beautiful doctor who has a respectable life. So \r\npeople are going to say, \"I wonder what she's doing with him.\" How am I doing so \r\nfar? ",
        "Karen: That's not how it is. It's just -- I'm getting used to us, that's all.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Ok. That's fine. So, while you get used to us, why don't you just let \r\nyourself enjoy what's happening? ",
        "Karen: I can do that. ",
        "Ricky: Really? ",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm. ",

        "Ian: You all right? ",
        "Kate: Yeah. I'm just -- I'm really grateful Alison's all right. She's a \r\nreally sweet girl. She didn't deserve any of this. ",
        "Ian: No, no. But you want to know how it happened. Well, that makes two of \r\nus. ",
        "Kate: I just -- I don't know. I wish there were a cure like this for \r\neverything. ",
        "Ian: Be nice, wouldn't it? ",
        "Kate: Unfortunately, Alison still needs to stand trial for murder. ",

        "Kate: Ian, really, enough with the channeling -- ",
        "Ian: No, no, no, no, I talked to him on the phone. He's alive and well and \r\nliving in the lighthouse with Lucy. ",
        "Kate: How did that happen? How? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. Maybe there's someone up there who thought that the good \r\nguys needed a break. ",
        "Kate: You know, I think I could use a drink. ",
        "Ian: You think you need a drink? I'm off in a half-hour. Why don't I \r\ntake you? We'll celebrate the end of this nightmare. ",

        "Lucy: What? Rafe? Rafe! What -- ",
        "Alison: He can't even be in the same room as me. I don't know why any of this \r\nis happening. And I don't know what you're doing. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, ok. Ok, wait a minute. Alison, it's ok. I mean, we both know Rafe's \r\nan angel, so there's some glitch upstairs that we can handle. He will fix this.\r\n",
        "Alison: No, no. He doesn't have any memory of any of us, of anything. It's \r\nall gone. All of it is gone. ",

        "Karen: This? No, I do this all the time. ",
        "Ricky: Oh, you do? Hmm. ",
        "Karen: Sure. Banging out a few tunes on the skins, rock and rolling on the \r\nfloor with a very sexy drumming legend. ",
        "Ricky: Legend -- right. In his own mind. ",
        "Karen: I really think you could be a legend. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, that's some nice talk, but I wouldn't be putting down some \r\nbig bills on an ex-con who just -- ",
        "Karen: Ok, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You know, I don't want to hear \r\nany of this \"you're a doctor, I'm nothing\" bull, ok? Because that's what it is.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Hey, you're the one who's always worried about what people might \r\nthink. ",
        "Karen: I told you, that's because Frank and I have been together so long. But \r\nthe truth is you have more charm in that little finger than half the male \r\npopulation in Port Charles -- actually, the whole state of new york. And you're \r\nsmart, with or without a Ph.D. after your name. And you're kind and -- ",

        "Karen: I know I am. ",
        "Ricky: And maybe I'm too good for you. ",
        "Karen: You know, I was hoping that you'd never figure that out. ",
        "Ricky: So, you know what? You are going to have to do some heavy-duty \r\nconvincing, you know, to prove -- ",
