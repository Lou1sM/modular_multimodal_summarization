        "Ian tries to comfort Lucy, who is sad that Rhonda and Scott's time with their daughter was cut so short. She speaks to Christina on the phone and promises to see her in a little while, but her plans change when Ian becomes feverish with blood hunger. Dissuading him from having a packet of blood, Lucy proposes finding out whether her slayer powers have returned. In the interest of \"science,\" they make love on the living room couch.",
        "Joshua prepares to settle down with Alison and watch the MV-3 special. Alison reiterates her desire to be turned as punishment for causing the deaths of two of the best men she's ever known. Forcing the watch back onto her wrist, Joshua resumes the mind control. When the alarm goes off, Alison kisses him.",
        "A crowd gathers at the Elixir to watch the MV-3 special on the Stephen Clay Experience. Ricky, Caz, Elizabeth, Reese, and Joshua are all interviewed, as well as musician Angela McClosky. The band members hint at the possibility that their former frontman is a vampire, and Elizabeth, as his estranged wife, confirms that he does bite. The special is filled with the band's music, as well as images of blood packets, magazine covers, and newspaper headlines. They also show footage of the concert, including Rafe's attention-grabbing scene on the stage. During a commercial break, Ricky sees Casey smiling at him from across the room, but she vanishes before he can reach her. Ricky isn't into the high life anymore after losing Casey and watching Karen die. In the special, Joshua takes full credit for the band's success and blames Stephen for its ultimate failure. Jack predicts that things are about to fall down around Joshua's head, and he's right. Everyone is stunned when Stephen Clay himself gives an interview on the special. He describes Joshua as a liar, a cheat, and a thief, and he blames the manager for the problems with the band. \"Stephen\" also announces his plan to reunite the group. Hearing this, Reese becomes excited, but Ricky is finished with the band. Watching from home, Joshua is apoplectic. He calls the club and orders Jack to turn the TV off. Jack instead cranks the volume for everyone's pleasure.",
        "Joshua is livid to find Caleb and Olivia in his home. They have possession of the remote, and they turn the TV back on for the big news. The announcement states that as they were putting together the final cut, they received word that Joshua Temple had been found dead of unknown causes."

        "Narrator: Tonight -- a band that burst on the scene in the fall of 2002, created a sensation with their music and their mystery, a lead singer who shunned the spotlight to the point of obsession and then almost as quickly dropped out of sight.",
        "Joshua: Stephen was a raw, extraordinary talent. He was waiting to be shaped.",
        "Caz: Stephen Clay is a genius, but he can be his own worst enemy.",
        "Angela: Oh, Stephen's debut album took my breath away. It was like he'd stolen my soul. It was amazing.",
        "Narrator: This was a band that had only one C.D. released and no videos at all. They went to great lengths to keep their leader's identity a secret -- flying in the face of music industry conventions. Were they just a group of hard-working musicians, or were they hiding deeper, darker secret?",
        "Ricky: When Stephen invited me to join the band, I never cared about his personal preferences. So what if he wants to work all night and sleep all day, if his red wine isn't really red wine? I mean, what's it to me? All I knew is he was offering me the opportunity of a lifetime.",
        "Caz: That's right. That's right!",
        "Reese: Stephen is one of the sexiest men I've ever met. I never understood why he hates the spotlight so much -- at least not until the mystery started to reveal itself.",
        "Narrator: Tonight -- an \"Inside The Music\" look at the mystique and the phenomenon known as the Stephen Clay Experience.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Caz: Oh, man, this rocks!",
        "Reese: I could never get used to myself on TV. Admit it, rock star, this is way better than winning \"American Idol.\"",
        "Jack: Hey, water down the hard stuff. We got to make this thing last all night.",
        "Reese: Jack, will you give it a rest? You're going to miss the whole show!",
        "Jack: Reese, that is why God made V.C.R.'s. I mean, come on, don't you think it's kind of funny that Joshua -- he's the one throwing this bash and he's not even here to enjoy it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You got to check this out. I think you're going to like it.",
        "Rafe: This might come as a surprise to you, but the last thing I want to do is sit around and watch you get your ego stroked.",
        "Caleb: Oh, it has nothing to do with my ego.",
        "Rafe: Oh, right. And Alison's safe and sound at home, right? I thought you were hatching some sort of plan to get her out of that hellhole.",
        "Caleb: You know what your problem is? You're a victim of linear thinking.",
        "Rafe: What are you -- do you have any idea what he's talking about?",
        "Livvie: He always has a plan.",
        "Caleb: Just keep watching. This is about to become a real eye opener.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm so glad you're in the mood to celebrate.",
        "Joshua: Hmm. I'm actually very flattered there's an entire television network going to focus on my genius this evening. And as if that wasn't thrilling enough, well, I also have you. Given the choice between death and spending eternity with me, you've chosen me.",
        "Alison: It's only because that's the worst possible punishment I can possibly think of. I'm responsible for the deaths of two of the greatest men I have ever known, and death would simply be too easy. There would be no justice in that for Rafe or Jamal.",
        "Joshua: Well, you don't have to worry your pretty little head about that much longer because after I've turned you, you won't have a will of your own.",
        "Alison: I thought you said you wanted a bride, not a slave.",
        "Joshua: Yes, I did say that once, didn't I? Now, who did I say that to? Let me think. Ah, yes -- the late, great Jamal. Give me your wrist.",
        "Alison: No. No, I don't want the watch. Ah! It hurts.",
        "Joshua: Of course you want this. You remember the time you said you'd make an effort for me? We can get back to that.",
        "[Alarm beeps]",
        "Joshua: Make an effort.",
        "Alison: I don't want to.",
        "Joshua: Yes, you do. What time is it?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Joshua: Think hard, Alison, think very hard. What time is it?",
        "[Joshua's voice echoes]",
        "[Alarm stops]",
        "Alison: It's time.",
        "Joshua: Yes. It's time for us to become what we're supposed to be.",

        "Ian: Everybody tried, you know? They -- they tried to make it a special thing for Karen. And --",
        "Lucy: I know. I know. It just never seems to be enough, does it? I just feel so connected to Karen, just because of Scott and Serena and -- I don't know, it's just like she's part of my whole wacky, crazy extended family somehow.",
        "Ian: She is.",
        "Lucy: I hope someone remembers to call Joe. If not, I'm going to have to do that -- and Jagger. I want them to know what a wonderful, special person she was and that maybe she didn't die in vain.",
        "Ian: In vain? Come here.",
        "Ian: Everybody dies. You know that. She had a chance to give you life so you can be with your girls, you can be with me. There's a lot of people who love you.",
        "Lucy: Thanks. I know that. I just -- I know I'm supposed to be feeling really blessed right now. It's just I don't have any joy. I can't feel it. I just keep thinking that I have a lifetime with my daughters, and Rhonda and Scott --",
        "Ian: The best thing we can do is remember how much she loved it here, and maybe make it a better place.",
        "Lucy: If it's not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: From a couple of fans.",
        "Caz: Hmm? I have died and gone to heaven. What's up, dude? This is what you've been busting your hump for.",
        "Ricky: I know, Caz, but it just doesn't taste quite as sweet as I thought.",
        "Caz: Whoa, man, what more could you ask for -- fame, sex, rock 'n roll? Come on, Rick.",
        "Ricky: Karen's dead. Casey's gone. The rest of it means nothing. Damn it.",
        "Reese: Ok, everyone, we're back! Could we have some reverence, please!",
        "[Reese turns TV on]",
        "Caz: All right, all right.",
        "Narrator: Stephen Clay was a struggling musician when he met Joshua Temple, a man with his finger --",
        "Caz: Turn it up, turn it up.",
        "Narrator: On the pulse of the contemporary music scene.",
        "Joshua: This guy sends me a tape out of the blue. No one had heard of him, but there he was. I don't use the word \"genius\" lightly, but that was Stephen.",
        "Narrator: Stephen Clay came out of nowhere, somewhat naive about the inner workings of the music business.",
        "Joshua: Stephen was reluctant to perform live. It wasn't shyness, it was actually arrogance. But I had a vision, and he needed a band behind him. Though I must say he wrote interesting music, he needed focus. He needed someone to take his creativity and put it into words.",
        "Narrator: So while Stephen himself became more reclusive, Joshua Temple went to work executing his vision -- refining the musicians and collaborators to showcase Stephen's magic.",
        "Caz: Ah! Yeah, baby. You get to know people pretty well, but Stephen was an enigma. After all the time we spent together, I still don't know much about the man beneath the image.",
        "Joshua: I knew I had the hook we needed. I mean, keeping the mystery, building the mystique was the key to the success of the Stephen Clay experience. I mean, not that the music wasn't compelling, but, I mean, sheer talent is rarely enough, really. I mean, Bowie created Ziggy Stardust. Kiss, of course, they had their masks. But with Stephen, it was the charismatic lead singer you never saw. Now we just needed the finishing touches.",
        "Reese: I was playing at this local club back home, and all of a sudden these two blokes appeared. Poof, out of nowhere, there they were. Joshua already had this reputation on the London music scene, but Stephen -- dark, mysterious, some people called it hypnotic. Well, he managed to hypnotize me right out of that grungy club into the wildest ride of my entire life.",
        "Caz: I remember our first rehearsal as a band. I felt it in my soul. It was like my life had changed forever. It was just -- man, it was like you could feel the hair standing up on the back of your neck. Stephen was not of this world.",
        "Reese: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Ricky: It was like perfect, creative chemistry. I mean, I'm not sure how Stephen felt about me because you never know with that guy. But Joshua was all over me being part of that group. For me it was a dream come true -- the best musicians, the best music. We were shooting right for the stars, top of the world. Arrogant jerk.",
        "Jack: It's all coming down too easy. There's going to be a shoe dropping here tonight, and it might be dropping right on Joshua's head.",
        "Joshua: I don't know precisely when the vampire rumors started, but they took on a life of their own. I mean, if that's what people choose to believe --",
        "[Reese laughs]",
        "Reese: Well, if Stephen's a vampire, what does that make the rest of us?",
        "Elizabeth: You know, I didn't even know who Stephen was when we first met. I didn't. Well, he hadn't gone public yet, and -- oh. Boy, but I was hooked from minute one. Yeah, Stephen has this way of -- of making you believe anything that he says. It's not that I'm gullible, it's just that he is simply that seductive. And I can confirm, for the record, that he does bite.",
        "Angela: Wow, Stephen's more than just an extraordinary musician. It's just he has some very unusual talents.",
        "Jack: Well, I knew the first time I laid eyes on Stephen at the concert in Port Charles that he wasn't what he seemed.",
        "Narrator: It was the open-air concert in Port Charles where the world got its first look at the frontman of the Stephen Clay experience. It's one of those moments that people will talk about for years.",
        "Caleb: I'm Stephen Clay.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Joshua: It's like Woodstock. You know, if everyone who claims to have been there in person had actually been there, well, the numbers are in the hundreds of thousands and counting.",
        "Caz: Joshua was against it from the beginning.",
        "Joshua: It went completely against my vision.",
        "Caz: And all we cared about was making music.",
        "Joshua: The whole thing got completely out of hand.",
        "Rafe: Everybody, you got to listen to me! This man -- he isn't who he says he is! And he's a vampire!",
        "Joshua: I thought it was a terrible idea, and I was right. That night marked the beginning of the end for Stephen Clay.",
        "Narrator: The publicity generated by the Port Charles gig sent the band's mystique skyrocketing. The Stephen Clay Experience was positioned to write its own ticket. There were no limits.",
        "Reese: It should've been the beginning of everything. But suddenly, the wheels seemed to just fly off.",
        "Joshua: He blew it. I mean, we had huge fights, but he'd stopped listening to me. He realized too late what a huge error in judgment he'd made. By then, he was making decisions based on some personal agenda, not what was best for his mates. Not to mention his fans.",
        "Elizabeth: Stephen is an incredibly passionate person, and sometimes just has trouble separating the different levels of his life.",
        "Caz: He started not showing up for rehearsal, so the music suffered. And it was incredibly frustrating because you knew the talent was still there. But he was lost. I mean, maybe it did have to do with his lifestyle. We'll never know.",
        "Jack: You've got to wonder what makes a guy like that self-destruct.",
        "Joshua: He wouldn't even make himself available to be interviewed for this show. It's crazy. Actually, it's worse than crazy. It's tragic.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joshua: Mission accomplish.. it was a real slap in the face to everyone who believes -- now I can focus all my attention on you, my princess. I'll make you my very own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Yeah, pumpkin head, mommy's feeling a whole lot better, and I can't wait to see your beautiful face. Um -- no. No -- actually, Serena needs to be with her daddy tonight, ok, because they're both feeling really sad and they need to just be together, ok? Hey, listen to me, you be good for grandma Gail and keep playing old maid and I'll see you in just a little while, ok? All right, I love you, too. Yeah. Ta.",
        "Ian: I know, I know. You don't have to tell me. I'm warm. I know it.",
        "Lucy: Warm? You're burning up. I haven't seen you like this in a very long time. You need to feed, don't you?",
        "Ian: That's ok, I got supply stuff right over here.",
        "Lucy: Wait. Um -- I don't know if I'm all better. I mean, you know, all -- have my powers back. Maybe I don't. But I think maybe in the interest of science, we should put me to the test. What do you think?",
        "Ian: What about Christina?",
        "Lucy: She'll be playing old maid with grandma Gail for hours. I -- I remember a time when you didn't need to feed at all. All you needed was me. And I want to have that back again, so -- please?",
        "Ian: Sure you're up to it?",
        "Lucy: I think we should give it a try.",
        "Ian: Yeah.",

        "Narrator: The Stephen Clay Experience was about to fall out of the limelight as quickly as they'd appeared. Was Stephen Clay responsible for his own failure, or does the blame lie squarely on the shoulders of manager Joshua Temple? Stay tuned as \"Inside The Music\" continues its profile of The Stephen Clay Experience, when Stephen Clay takes up his own defense and makes an astonishing announcement about his plans for the future.",
        "Caleb: There's only one man responsible for the disintegration of our band. Our manager is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. If you have to blame someone, blame Joshua Temple.",

        "Caz: Just you, dude. Just you.",
        "Caleb: I'm not really comfortable giving interviews. I try to let the music speak for me. But I owe it to the people to set the record straight. The Stephen Clay Experience was always my brainchild. Staying invisible was my idea. Revealing myself was my idea. And it was my decision to break up the group, mostly because I refused to engage in a power struggle with Joshua Temple.",
        "Narrator: Rather than tear apart the band a piece at a time, Stephen made the difficult decision to end the highly successful but relatively short run of The Stephen Clay Experience.",
        "Caleb: The hard part is I still have so much to say musically. I miss the work. I miss the band. So I decided to reunite the group, try to pick up where we left off.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: My personal life did cross over into my music, but I'm an artist, not a businessman. The music is my life. Who I love, what I feel is what drives my passion. Things happen. The way you look at the world, the way you feel. And the audience will either go on that ride or they won't. I never meant to insult our fans or disrespect them. That's why it's so important to put the band back together.",
        "Reese: Well, did you know?",
        "Caz: Not a clue. It's great, though.",
        "Reese: Well, you can definitely count me in.",
