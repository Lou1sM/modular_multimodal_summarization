        "Gabriela: You're bleeding. ",
        "Joe: I'll live. ",
        "Gabriela: Here, let me make it better. ",
        "Joe: Gabby, what the hell is wrong with you? ",
        "Gabriela: I want you, Joe. ",
        "Joe: You're seeing someone else, remember? ",
        "Gabriela: Please don't go. ",
        "Joe: You know, I came here because I thought you need help, because -- I \r\ndon't know, I didn't want to believe that you'd changed so completely, but you \r\nhave. And I'm sorry, Gabby, I -- I don't think you know what you need anymore.\r\n",
        "",
        "Karen: Sorry, Joe's not working tonight. Actually, he's resigned. I'm just \r\ncovering a few of his shifts for the time being. Ok. Hey. ",
        "Frank: You know, it's just sinking in. Joe is really leaving. ",
        "Karen: Well, at least he's going off to a great new job. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, all alone. ",
        "Karen: Not exactly the way he had planned it. ",
        "Frank: I still can't believe Gabby blew him off. I thought she was in love \r\nwith my brother. ",
        "Karen: Guess you don't really know somebody as well as you think you do. ",
        "Frank: Hey, yo, Jamal. Jamal! ",
        "Jamal: Hey, Frank. ",
        "Frank: Hey, man. What are you doing here? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, just checking in on one of my boys. He's sick. ",
        "Karen: What's wrong with him? ",
        "Jamal: That's what I'm trying to figure out. Later, guys. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, later. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, this is whack. I must be tripping. But there's only one way to \r\nfind out if Jack's what I think he is. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: I offered you the world, an eternity of pleasure. It was a mistake to \r\nthink you'd be grateful or even useful to me. So your time is up. ",
        "Jack: Go ahead. You've already done the worst. ",
        "Livvie: Jack? Jack! ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Jack, I don't care what you say. I am not leaving you out here all \r\nalone. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I'm not -- alone. Look, Livvie, you've got to get out of here \r\nnow. ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Jack: Go. ",
        "Livvie: No! ",
        "Alison: Livvie, please come back to the car. ",
        "Jack: Alison, I thought -- I told you to take her home. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry! What am I supposed to do, knock her out and drag her? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not leaving, Jack. Why do you keep pushing me away? Talk to me, \r\nplease. ",
        "Jack: Just listen to me. There is something I got to handle. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, we can handle this together. ",
        "Jack: No, no, we can't. Ok? I've gone through some changes. I'm not the same \r\nperson you once knew. ",
        "Livvie: What are you talking about? When I look at you, all I see is the man \r\nthat I love. ",
        "Jack: I just need some time. Ok? Please, I'm begging you to go home with \r\nAlison. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, please. Come on, please. ",
        "Livvie: But, Jack -- ",
        "Jack: I love you. And I always will. ",

        "Kevin: Gotcha. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, Dr. Collins. ",
        "Kevin: Just saw you coming down the hall. I was wondering if I could have a \r\nword with you about Jack. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, what about him? ",
        "Kevin: Well, he's your friend. I thought maybe you might have some idea as to \r\nwhat's eating him lately. ",
        "Jamal: You know what, Dr. Collins? Don't even go there. ",
        "Kevin: Is there something I can help with? ",
        "Jamal: Know what? Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean you have all the \r\nanswers, ok? Especially not these. ",

        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Joe: Hey. Well, I'm all packed up. ",
        "Frank: So you're really leaving town, huh? You couldn't stand to lose to me \r\nin hoops one more time, is that it? ",
        "Joe: Since when have I ever lost? ",
        "Frank: Oh. ",
        "Karen: You know, we're going to miss you like crazy. ",
        "Frank: But that -- that clinic at Bounds Corners is lucky to have you. ",
        "Karen: You know, we should've thrown a going-away party or retired your \r\nlocker. ",
        "Joe: Actually, there is something you can do for me. It's about Gabby. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Come on, Livvie, pick up the phone. ",

        "Gabriela's Voice: I have to go. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: No, you don't. Now comes the fun part. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: I'm with someone. Joe. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: You sure about that? ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: Please. No, don't. Stop. No. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: Let's do this again sometime. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: Wait, you can't leave me like this. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: Don't worry. These will go away. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: That's not what I meant. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: You're not the one. But you can be of use to me. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: When will I see you again? ",
        "Caleb's Voice: I'll find you. Sleep tight, my sweet. Don't let the bedbugs bite. ",

        "Jack: What are you doing here? ",
        "Jamal: Hey, we got to talk. ",
        "Jack: I'm really not in the mood. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, well, too bad, ok, because this can't wait. Look, I think I know \r\nwhat's wrong with you, ok? It's a little out there, but -- ",
        "Jack: Jamal, I really don't want to get into this. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? Too bad because I'm not stepping until you tell me \r\nwhat's up with you. ",
        "Jack: I'm sick, ok? ",
        "Jamal: No, I think you're a little bit more than sick. ",
        "Jack: Oh, so you think you know so much about me now, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Just tell me that you're not one of them. ",
        "Jack:  Them? ",
        "Jamal: The dude with the fangs and that daylight problem. ",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Jamal, are you crazy? ",
        "Jamal: Damn it, Jack, just tell me you're not a vampire, ok? ",
        "",
        "Frank: So you went to Gabby's place again? ",
        "Joe: Yeah, and if I didn't know any better, I'd think this new guy of hers \r\nhas her on some kind of drug. ",
        "Frank: What do you mean? ",
        "Joe: Well, like when I went over to see her, you know, at first she was \r\nreally cold, and then all of a sudden she -- she was all over me. ",
        "Frank: You think she wants to get back together? ",
        "Joe: No, no. It's more like she was possessed. ",
        "Frank: I don't get how this change could happen so fast. ",
        "Joe: Me neither. But it's not my problem anymore. Gabby made it very clear \r\nthat she doesn't want my help. So, it's time I hit the road, huh? ",
        "Karen: Wow. This is really it, huh? ",
        "Joe: Yeah. You two be good to each other, all right? You have something \r\ngreat, something you both deserve. Don't let go of that. ",
        "Frank: Not a chance. Now, you've got your laptop, right, so we can e-mail, \r\nand your cell phone? ",
        "Joe: Yeah, they got my phone hooked up at my new place, too, so we'll be in \r\ncontact all the time. You'll hardly know I'm gone. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah, hardly. ",
        "Joe: Ok, then. ",
        "Frank: Ok. ",

        "",
        "Alison: Maybe Jack is just going through some guy stuff. You know, maybe he \r\njust needs some breathing room. ",
        "Livvie: Whatever it is, we should be going through this together. ",
        "Alison: I know -- ",
        "[knock on door] ",

        "Kevin: Honey, what is it? Is it Jack again? ",
        "Livvie: God, I love him so much, Dad. He just keeps pulling away from me more \r\nand more each day. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you said he hasn't really been himself lately. Maybe he's just \r\n-- ",
        "Livvie: What? What do you think's going on? ",
        "Kevin: Maybe he's just not ready for a major commitment right now. It \r\nhappens. ",
        "Livvie: No. No, Dad, you don't know him like I do. ",
        "Kevin: You know what? You're right. But what I can do is listen. ",
        "Livvie: Jack's not who I ever pictured as my white knight, but he is. He just \r\n-- he swept into my life when I needed him most. You know, he always had faith \r\nin me, in us. Even when I doubted, he didn't. I -- I was all closed up when I \r\nfirst met Jack, but he found his way into my heart. Dad, he makes me so happy. \r\nAnd no matter what I was going through or how confused I was, he never gave up \r\non me, so I don't want to give up on him. I just -- I think I realize that \r\nJack's love was a gift. And somehow I just know, you know, what Jack and I have \r\ntogether will get him through whatever trouble he's in. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Just leave me alone, man. ",
        "Jamal: Look, just tell me I'm bugging out and I will. Come on, Jack, tell me \r\nI'm losing my mind. Tell me anything. Telling me I'm watching too much \r\nlate-night TV -- something other than this \"V\" word. ",
        "Jack: I can't. Jamal, I need your help, man. I wish I could tell you what was \r\ngoing on with me. I wish. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. All right, look, this is not going how I hoped it would. It's \r\nreally not, ok? All right, Jack, just -- just tell me what you know. Ok, just \r\nfill in the blanks. ",
        "Jack: I met this guy tonight and he told me he hunted me down and he bit me \r\nto make me like him -- a vampire. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jamal: How did -- why you? ",
        "Jack: Because he said he wanted Livvie. But, Jamal, I'll be damned if I'm \r\ngoing to let him get near her. ",
        "Jamal: Wait, wait, wait. This has got to be the same guy that's been \r\nfollowing Livvie around. You know, what's his name? ",
        "Jack: Caleb. ",
        "Jamal: That's him! That's him. Livvie said he took her to his hideout place, \r\nsome cave or something like that. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Jamal: Well, she said that nothing happened, but she was pretty freaked. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I won't let him get near Livvie. I'll die first before he gets to \r\nher. ",
        "Jamal: Didn't you already do that? I mean, just die, I mean? ",
        "Jack: No, no, maybe -- maybe this Caleb got his noise talking about it, \r\nJamal, right? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe -- maybe -- I don't know -- I mean, just \r\nbecause I see you freaked out and everything, that doesn't make you a vampire. \r\nYou know, I mean, it's not like you're flying around here or anything. Are you?\r\n",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Hey, are you all right? Jack, you -- hey, you're not changing on \r\nme or anything, are you? ",
        "Jack: Oh, Jamal. It hurts. Why does it hurt so much? ",
        "Jamal: I think I know, Jack. Just hold up. ",
        "Jamal: There's only one way to find out if you are what Caleb's saying you \r\nare. ",
        "Jack: Where'd you get that? ",
        "Jamal: I boosted it from the hospital. If my theory's right, then you're \r\njonesing for this blood. All right?",
        "",
        "Frank: What's that for? ",
        "Karen: Just what the doctor ordered. You miss your brother, right? ",
        "Frank: Yeah -- he's only been gone an hour. ",
        "Karen: You know, you have to think of the positive. You gave up your dream of \r\nbecoming a doctor so you could put him through med school, and now he's off \r\nhelping others. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know, I'm proud of him. ",
        "Karen: You know, if it would help, you can teach me to play hoops. ",

        "Karen: Gabby. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. Yeah, we could keep an eye on her, make sure she stays out of \r\ntrouble. Joe would like that. ",

        "Kevin: Well, you don't have to explain it to me twice. I understood what love \r\nreally meant the day I realized you were my daughter. ",
        "Livvie: I just -- I don't want to let you down. ",
        "Kevin: You could never let me down. So I'm a little overprotective. You don't \r\nmind if I lock you in a closet or a convent till you're about 50, do you? ",
        "Livvie: I think you might be a little too late. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, well. You snooze, you lose. Look, Livvie, I'd never try to keep \r\nyou away from a man who means so much to you. All I can really promise is that \r\nI'll be in your corner, no matter what. ",

        "Kevin: As long as your grandmother and Archie are away, why don't you just \r\ncome live with me, at least until Jack gets himself together. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, that is a good idea. I mean, you could really use a family \r\naround. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Yeah, I will. As long as you promise not to lock me in any \r\nclosets. ",
