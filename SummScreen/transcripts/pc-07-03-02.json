        "Kate: It's official. ",
        "Ian: What's official? ",
        "Kate: All charges have been dropped against Alison. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? How'd you do that in the middle of the night? ",
        "Kate: Well, apparently Kevin and the police commissioner are best friends.\r\n",
        "Ian: Mac, right. ",
        "Kate: So they verified that Kevin is indeed alive, filled out a little \r\npaperwork, and Alison's off the hook. ",
        "Ian: Thanks for coming to tell me. ",
        "Kate: Yeah -- there's another reason I came by. ",
        "Ian: You just can't stay away from me, can you? ",
        "Kate: Yeah -- yeah, that's it. No, I was curious -- did they ever arrest that \r\nwife abuser? ",
        "Ian: No. By the time police got here, he'd already taken off. ",
        "Kate: Hopefully for good. ",
        "Ian: Exactly. ",
        "Kate: But doubtful. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Probably just trying to find her alone. ",
        "Kate: That's ridiculous domestic violence is so hard to prosecute. ",
        "Frank: Somebody help me over here! ",
        "Man: Get away! Stay away from me! Stop! ",
        "Ian: What happened? ",
        "Colleen: We found him in the stairwell. ",
        "Frank: I have no idea. ",
        "Man: Angel of death -- he had no eyes! The angel of death! ",

        "Jack: Alison -- oh, my God. Nurse! Nurse! ",
        "Alison: Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, it's ok. It's ok. ",
        "Jack: No, it's not ok. ",
        "Alison: No, I'm fine. ",
        "Jack: You're not fine, you're hurt. ",
        "Alison: Listen to me -- I just -- I think I got a little tired from moving \r\nfrom room to room. I'm just -- ",
        "Jack: Here. ",
        "Alison: I tried to stand up and my legs were like rubber, ok? So just help me \r\nget back to the bed, ok? ",
        "Jack: Are you sure you're ok? ",
        "Alison: I'm fine. I'm ok. ",
        "Jack: Come on, easy. Just take it easy. ",
        "Alison: I know. I'm ok. ",
        "Jack: Just hop in there. Now, little lady, what were you thinking, getting \r\nout of bed? ",
        "Alison: I was -- oh, my God. I was trying to go find Rafe. ",
        "Jack: All right, enough about that. ",
        "Alison: No, listen. Jack, I really need to talk to him. ",
        "Jack: No, you listen. All you need to concentrate on is getting better, ok?\r\n",
        "Alison: He doesn't remember me. He doesn't remember me, and he doesn't \r\nremember how in love we were. ",
        "Jack: I know. ",
        "Alison: This is the worst kind of pain that I have ever felt in my whole \r\nlife. I really just wish that I didn't wake up, you know? ",
        "Jack: Listen to me, do not say that. ",
        "Alison: No -- ",
        "Jack: Do not say that. ",
        "Alison: I don't really mean that, but I feel so empty. I feel like I have \r\nnothing now. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, listen to me. ",
        "Alison: No. ",
        "Jack: No, look at me. You are not going to go through this alone. Believe me \r\nwhen I say that. ",
        "Alison: I just wish that I had enough strength to get to her. ",
        "Jack: Who? ",
        "Alison: I wish that I could hurt her as much as she's hurting him. ",
        "Jack: Alison, what are you talking about? ",
        "Alison: Rafe. It's Rafe, Jack. Livvie is destroying him. She's destroying \r\nRafe. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Is this your subtle way of reminding me that we're not supposed to \r\nlie in the house of God? ",
        "Rafe: No. I just wanted to come to someplace quiet. But, yeah, I think that's \r\nthe way it's supposed to be. We're supposed to tell the truth, especially to the \r\npeople we claim to love. ",
        "Livvie: Claim to love? Rafe, you know how much I love you. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I've heard you say that, and I've read it. ",
        "Livvie: What do you mean, you've read it? Oh, my God. You read my journal?\r\n",
        "Rafe: I needed answers that you weren't giving me. ",
        "Livvie: So then you read somebody's private thoughts? ",
        "Rafe: Well, actually, I was very moved by what you wrote about us. ",
        "Livvie: You were? ",
        "Rafe: I actually really believed that we fell in love. That's what I came \r\nhere to the hospital to tell you. ",
        "Livvie: Thank God. Because you can believe anything -- anything you want to \r\nbelieve, but never doubt that, Rafe, please. Please, never, ever doubt how much \r\nI love you. ",
        "Rafe: Well, I'm trying. But -- why did you lie to me? Is it because you were \r\nafraid that when I finally did see Alison that I would fall in love with her \r\nagain? ",

        "Karen: I'll get some x-rays, run some tests, try to figure out what happened \r\nto him. ",
        "Ian: Let me know as soon as you find something. ",
        "Karen: Ok. Let's go. ",
        "Ian: What was he babbling about, huh? Some faceless angel of death? What is \r\nthat? ",
        "Frank: The only other thing he said was something about a black hood. I don't \r\nknow. It didn't make any sense. ",
        "Ian: A black hood? ",
        "Frank: Don't ask me. I'm going to go call the cops. ",
        "Kate: Well, at least now this guy knows what it feels like to be beaten up.\r\n",
        "Ian: Eye for an eye? ",
        "Kate: Something like that. ",
        "Ian: Oh. So you think this is some kind of a vigilante justice? ",
        "Kate: I don't know, but that guy was going to walk, and after what he did to \r\nhis wife -- someone made sure that if he walks, it'll be with a limp. ",
        "Ian: Let me ask you something, Kathryn. Do you have a black hood in your \r\nwardrobe? ",
        "Kate: Yeah, but I only wear it for bad hair days. ",
        "Ian: Oh. ",
        "Kate: No one's called me Kathryn since I was a kid. ",
        "Ian: When you were naughty, maybe? ",
        "Kate: What do you make of this guy's story? The whole black-hooded creature \r\nattacking him? ",
        "Karen: Ready for some bizarre medical facts? ",
        "Ian: What'd you find? ",
        "Karen: Well, the initial exam shows half the bones in his body are broken, \r\nhis blood pressure's way down, and his heart is beating like a scared rabbit, \r\nbut -- ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Karen: The kicker is he doesn't have a mark on him. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Livvie and Rafe are married? ",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Jack: So the guy who hit me at the cabin -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was Rafe. ",
        "Jack: Well, this is all starting to make sense, at least. I mean, I go into \r\nthe cabin, and all of a sudden, Livvie starts undressing in front of me. And \r\nthat must have been when Rafe walked in, and that's when she yelled \"rape.\" ",
        "Alison: That's probably when he hit you, you know? He thought that he was \r\nprotecting her. ",
        "Jack: Well, she definitely does have a way with men. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's -- that's very true. I just wish that I could have \r\nwalked in that door, you know what I mean? If I could have just gotten there \r\nsooner, then I could have stopped all this a really long time ago. ",
        "Jack: No, Alison, listen, there's no way you could have known Livvie and Rafe \r\nwere together. I mean, I would have never guessed it. ",
        "Alison: She's just feeding him, like, all kinds of lies. Jack, she told him \r\nthat they fell in love, like, a long time ago and that they left us for each \r\nother. ",
        "Jack: Wow. Well, at this point, I wouldn't put anything past her. But, \r\nAlison, ok -- do you think that, you know, before Rafe left, that maybe -- ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jack: Livvie and Rafe were already -- ",
        "Alison: Ew, yuck. No. ",
        "Jack: Well -- ",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no. Rafe would never have been with Livvie when he \r\nwas with me. No, I promise you, he did not leave me for Livvie. ",
        "Jack: Well, Alison, he did leave you. And the next thing we knew, they're \r\nshacked up in some cabin. ",
        "Alison: No. Livvie got to Rafe after he lost his memory, I guarantee you \r\nthat. She's been feeding him all kinds of lies, Jack, because we are so perfect \r\ntogether. And nobody could come between us, I promise you that. I believe in \r\nRafe, in our love, more than anything, and I will never stop believing in it.\r\n",
        "",
        "Livvie: That's what you think this is about? You get -- you get one glimpse \r\nof Alison, and everything we've shared, everything we've meant to each other is \r\njust erased? That's what you think I'm afraid of? ",
        "Rafe: That's what it's feeling like to me, but please, please, tell me I'm \r\nwrong. ",
        "Livvie: You are wrong, Rafe. You are so wrong, but what do I have to do to \r\nprove it to you? My God, I have opened up my soul to you. ",
        "Rafe: All I want you to do is to tell me the truth. Why did you lie to me? \r\nOk, fine. ",
        "Livvie: No -- no, please. Please. ",
        "Livvie: Yes. Yeah, I've -- I've made mistakes. And I told you things that \r\nweren't true because I was scared -- and not of you falling in love with Alison \r\n-- because I trust your feelings for me. I know they're going to come back \r\ncompletely. I just -- I felt threatened in other ways. ",
        "Rafe: Go on. ",
        "Livvie: I mean, just think about it, Rafe. Thank God my father is safe, and I \r\nam so grateful for that. But like everyone else, I thought he was murdered. And \r\nI really believed that Alison was behind it. ",
        "Rafe: But she wasn't. And you accused her of your father's murder, and look \r\nwhat happened -- she almost died. ",
        "Livvie: But that wasn't my fault. I'm not the one who put her on trial. The \r\nstate did because of all the evidence that pointed to her. Rafe, I'm not the \r\nonly one in this town who thinks she's dangerous. ",
        "Rafe: So that's why you wanted me to stay away from her? ",
        "Livvie: She was obsessed with you. She hated me. She hated that both of us \r\nwere falling love with each other. She called me and threatened me, Rafe. And \r\nthen you wanted to go and see her? ",
        "Rafe: So then you brought in a girl to pretend to be her. ",
        "Livvie: You were really determined to see Alison, and I was truly afraid of \r\nwhat she would do to us if we did. That's -- that's why I was so anxious to get \r\nus out of Port Charles. I wanted us to be safe. I wanted to be able to share my \r\nlife with you without having to look over my shoulder. And we -- we can still \r\nhave that. I can make you happy. You know that. ",
        "Rafe: No, I don't. I don't know a damn thing. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, baby. You don't -- you don't know because you aren't sure, you \r\ndon't remember. ",
        "Rafe: Because you won't let me remember. ",
        "Livvie: Because the doctor told me that -- ",
        "Rafe: Oh, no, no -- the doctor. That's another thing. I mean, you want to \r\nkeep me away from people who know me, people that I actually know. A family that \r\nI had no idea that I had. And for what? For what reason? To protect me? ",
        "Livvie: Rafe, I didn't -- I didn't want you going into town because of Alison \r\nand -- ",
        "Rafe: And, you know, another thing -- by the way, these people, they have no \r\nclue why you and I would be together. ",
        "Livvie: Because our love was a secret. You know that. ",
        "Rafe: No, I -- I don't know that. I just know what you tell me. And, you \r\nknow, I feel so drawn here, and all you want to do is keep me away. And if you \r\nknew me, if you really knew me, if you knew what was important to me -- what \r\nI've been missing, what I've been wanting my whole life -- is a home, is a \r\nfamily, is a place where I feel like I can stay, where I feel like I belong. You \r\nknow? And you just -- well, I feel like -- something in me's telling me that \r\nthis is the place. And someone is pushing me away. Surprise -- that someone is \r\nyou, Livvie. ",
        "",
        "Ian: What do you mean, there's no mark on him? He's got broken bones. There's \r\ngot to be scrapes and bruises or something. ",
        "Karen: I know, but there aren't. I mean, the fact that this guy is even alive \r\nis a miracle. ",
        "Ian: What does that mean? ",
        "Karen: Well, whoever did this to him knew exactly how far to go. One more \r\nshake and this guy would have been history. I'm having them take him to a secure \r\nroom in I.C.U. ",
        "Ian: Can I have a minute with him? ",
        "Officer: Go ahead, but you're not going to get much out of him. The lights \r\nare pretty much out. ",
        "Ian: Mr. Fischer, it's Dr. Thornhart. I treated your wife. I've got to ask \r\nyou a question. This -- this angel of death -- what'd he look like? ",

        "Alison: I promise you that while he was holding me in his arms and he was \r\npromising to love me for all of eternity, that he was not with someone else. ",
        "Jack: Ok, Alison, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said what I said -- ",
        "Alison: Jack, I can't tell you why he left, but he did. He had a really good \r\nreason and it wasn't his fault, ok? ",
        "Jack: Ok, ok. Just calm down, all right? ",
        "Alison: We really loved each other -- we still do. I love him more than \r\nanything and I know that he loves me, too. I don't understand why he can't \r\nremember. ",
        "Jack: Alison, listen to me. You need to calm down. You've been sick -- ",
        "Alison: And what's really weird is what Livvie is doing to him. It's scaring \r\nme, because he likes to see all the good in people, you know. He really does. \r\nAnd I think that she's just really going to -- she's going to take advantage of \r\nthat, Jack, and she's going to, like, horn in on him and just try and -- ",
        "Jack: Easy, easy, hey, no -- ",
        "Alison: No, look, I need to get to her, ok? I really need to get to her \r\nbefore she does anything -- ",

        "",
        "Livvie: I do know you always wanted a home and a family, Rafe. We used to \r\ntalk about how much we wanted that together. And my fear of Alison was real. \r\nEverything I did was to protect us. ",
        "Rafe: You're wrong. ",
        "Livvie: Yes, I know that now, Rafe. We were all wrong about Alison murdering \r\nmy father. And believe me, no one is more glad about that than I am. ",
        "Rafe: That's not all you're wrong about. You kept me from people, Livvie. You \r\nkept me from my family. ",
        "Livvie: I thought that once Alison was in jail, that we could come back. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not what you said. You said you wanted to \r\nleave here forever. Now you're going to just turn that around? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, now that I know that Alison didn't kill my father, I am \r\nnot as afraid of her anymore, Rafe. And I know she's going to try and turn you \r\nagainst me. And I'm not worried about that. As long as you're safe -- as long as \r\nwe're safe -- then we -- we can stay here in Port Charles, if that's what you \r\nwant. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. I am definitely staying in Port Charles. ",
        "Livvie: Good. Good, because I -- I really want to stay here, too, now that my \r\nfather is back. And we can just make our life together here. ",
        "Rafe: You don't get it, do you? I -- I can't just forget about this. ",
        "Livvie: Just give it some time. It'll pass, Rafe, because -- because we love \r\neach other. You'll see. You'll understand. ",
        "Rafe: You say you love me, right? But you lied to me. You kept me isolated \r\nfrom everybody that was important to me. And if you let me just go with my gut \r\nand spend time with these people, maybe I would have been able to remember more.\r\n",
