        "After the MV-3 narrator announces the news of Joshua's death, Caleb taunts the stunned vampire leader. Since the ring will protect Joshua from all vampires, the slayer makes his entrance. Alison is both stunned and relieved to see Rafe alive, albeit bandaged and wearing a sling. Rafe attacks Joshua with a vengeance and soon emerges victorious; Joshua's body lies on the floor with the stake through the heart. The body vanishes, and when Caleb goes to get his ring, it isn't there. He accuses Rafe of reneging on his end of the bargain, but Rafe denies the accusation. He tries to take Alison and leave, but Caleb uses his powers to lock the doors. Rafe removes his shirt and sling to prove that he doesn't have the ring. From the way Alison is dressed, it's already obvious that she can't be hiding it. Olivia urges Rafe to see what Alison has become, cattily pointing out that she clearly wasn't planning to play chess in her red lace dress and stiletto heels. Overcome with remorse and humiliation, Alison begs Caleb to let her go. He does, and Alison flees, with Rafe right behind her. Olivia confronts Caleb for letting them go, but he points out if Rafe had his ring, he would have handed it over to save Alison. Rafe follows Alison as she flees barefoot through the woods, finally catching up with her. Alison sobs as she confesses how close she came to giving Joshua everything he wanted and becoming his bride. Fights break out at the Elixir in the wake of the news of Joshua's death. Jack is surprised to hear that Jamal is still a vampire, but Reese explains that since Joshua wasn't born into a vampire family, all his recruits will stay the way they are. Drowning his sorrows in shots of tequila, Jamal laments not being able to have the simple life he dreamed of. When he rejects Stacey's advances because she's a vamp, she informs a belligerent male vampire that Jamal doesn't think she's good enough for him. Glad to have a reason to fight Jamal, the vampire announces to the crowd that Jamal considers himself too good for them. Jack stops the anticipated brawl by getting everyone's attention and announcing that he has some new rules for the club. After making love, Ian reports that all his vampire symptoms are gone. Suddenly feeling a major shift in the forces of good and evil, Lucy realizes that her powers are back. Gail surprises them by bringing Christina home, but at least she warned them with a call from the car. Lucy gives Ian the news that Tim will be bringing Danny home to stay. Ian doesn't like this idea at first, but Lucy changes his mind. She wants them all to be a family, and she's going to make Kevin understand that their marriage is truly over. Meanwhile, Kevin is at the Elixir, looking at a photo of himself with Lucy. After running into a mysterious person lurking outside the club, Elizabeth joins Kevin and talks about how to get back what they've lost. Agreeing, Kevin walks out the door. Back at the loft, Olivia vows to get the ring back, no matter what it takes. She's afraid that Caleb will stop loving her if she doesn't."

        "Livvie: You don't believe me? Look at her. Huh? Look at what she's wearing -- or rather isn't wearing -- a red lace dress? Stilettos? I doubt she was planning on a night with Joshua playing chess in that outfit. Isn't that right, Alison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: That was it, huh? That was your big surprise - Christina coming home?",
        "Lucy: That was not supposed to be the surprise. It's a good thing Gail called from the car, from the drive, or else she might have caught us -- you know.",
        "Ian: So what's the surprise?",
        "Lucy: It -- it's not that. She's asleep. It's -- it's something different.",
        "Ian: Different?",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ian: Is it hidden on your person somewhere? Getting warm?",
        "Lucy: Um -- no, but I'm getting warm. Would you -- would you stop? Please, I want this to make you happy. I mean, I hope you like the surprise, so sit down. Just sit, sit.",
        "Ian: All right.",
        "Lucy: Ok. And close your eyes. Just close your eyes. Ok, close your eyes. They're not closed very tightly.",

        "Lucy: Open.",
        "Ian: Oh. This is mine. A picture of my son, Danny. Thank you very much. It's lovely.",
        "Lucy: I called Tim. He's bringing Danny home.",
        "Ian: For a visit?",
        "Lucy: No, not for a visit. He's bringing Danny home for good, to stay. You're going to have your son back.",
        "Ian: Um -- you shouldn't have done that. I wish to God you hadn't done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, man. You're getting there. Keep going.",
        "Jamal: Oh, no, no. Ain't enough tequila in this world to get me where I need to be, baby boy.",
        "Jack: Well, you know something? I've been thinking.",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa -- that could be kind of dangerous, now.",
        "Jack: I know --",
        "Jamal: I don't know about your thinking.",
        "Jack: No, I'm serious. Look, you got a lousy break. So have a lot of other people in this place. Look around -- vampires, mortals, and whoever else came to town looking for answers. Jamal, listen to me maybe there aren't any answers.",
        "Jamal: What -- what are you saying? You're not making no sense.",
        "Jack: I'm saying life is what it is. It's what you make it. And, you know what? Your dreams don't have to die. You just might have to change them.",
        "Jamal: Right, so you expect me just to roll with the punches. Is that what you're saying?",
        "Jack: Or you can sit back and feel sorry for yourself -- or play the cards you've been dealt.",
        "Jamal: What I'm saying -- I wanted my life to be simple. Just ride my bikes, you know, build my business, get me a fine little lady or something like that, make a family, some kids. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Jack: Right, I hear you.",
        "Stacey: Jamal. Long time, no see.",
        "Jamal: Stacey. Hey, hey, how you doing? I've been busy. What's going on?",
        "Stacey: Yeah. You ready to party, or what?",
        "Jamal: Actually, you know what, Stacey? Nothing against you or anything like that, but I was really never into this vampire stuff, so can you just step off?",
        "Stacey: What? Am I not good enough for you anymore?",
        "Jamal: Well, you take it however you want to take it, all right?",
        "Stacey: Is that what you're saying?",
        "Man: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is there a problem here?",
        "Stacey: Jamal here doesn't think us vampires are good for him anymore.",
        "Jamal: Oh, my God.",
        "Man: Is that so?",
        "Jamal: Yeah. So what? What do you want to do about it? You want to do something about it?",
        "Man: Oh, yeah. I've been itching for this fight, pal. Hey, guys. This one thinks he's too good for us.",
        "Woman: Oh, really?",

        "Caleb: She doesn't have it.",
        "Livvie: How can you be so sure?",
        "Caleb: Because Rafe would have given it up to save her life.",
        "Livvie: Ok, what if he has it, though? What if he has it? What if he hid it, and now they're going to go and use it?",
        "Caleb: Then they both would die.",
        "Livvie: Ok, what? Are you telling me that I'm going to take care of Rafe and you're going to actually kill Alison?",
        "Caleb: If Rafe understood the true power of the ring, I would do whatever's necessary.",
        "Livvie: Including killing Alison?",
        "Caleb: If she had it and she knew how to use it, wouldn't she have wished you dead already?",
        "Livvie: Ok. Ok, all right. If she doesn't have it, then -- then who do you think does?",
        "Caleb: I don't know! I don't know. But you know what? I'm going to find out. And when I do, I'm going to bury them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: What is it? Why -- why don't you want Danny to come home?",
        "Ian: Of course I want him to come home. There's nothing I want more in the world, but I'm -- I'm still -- I'm -- God.",

        "Ian: My symptoms go away for a little while.",
        "Lucy: Yes, yes. But even at your worst, when I was sick and I couldn't help you, you never, ever, ever really lost control. Now, Danny needs you. And I know you need him very much.",
        "Ian: I know you're right.",
        "Lucy: I am right because it's wrong for you two to be apart. It's wrong, and you need to be together, and you're his dad.",
