        "Lucy: Good grief. 50 zillion things on TV and not anything I want to watch. \r\nWhoo. These things make me hot. Fresh air, that's what I need. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, hi. It's me. I -- I know you're not there. Listen, I'm just \r\nsitting around hydrating my pores, you know, thinking about you, and -- listen, \r\ncall me as soon as you get in, ok? I really need to hear from you, and I want to \r\nmake sure you're ok. Don't ask me why, but I just feel like there's something, I \r\ndon't know, kind of funky about tonight. Call me. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Oh, Jack. If you could've seen your face when I told you you were \r\nbecoming a vampire. Oh! Oh. I really need to start videotaping this stuff. ",
        "Caleb: What -- what -- what? ",
        "[Caleb screams] ",
        "Michael: My God, Caleb. What are you doing? ",
        "Caleb: You let that whore wear Olivia's wedding dress! ",
        "",
        "Eve: Our wedding was so perfect, I -- I almost don't want to give this dress \r\nback to Michael. ",
        "Ian: Ah. Well, maybe you should put it on one more time. ",
        "Eve: You want me to put it on again? ",
        "Ian: So I can take it off you. ",
        "Eve: Do you ever get tired? ",
        "Ian: Not of you. Come here. ",
        "Eve: Whoa! ",
        "Ian: What do you say we stay here and get naked, celebrate our marriage one \r\nmore time? ",
        "Eve: Do you really think you should be talking that way in front of our \r\nchild? ",
        "Ian: The baby's going to know right away how his father feels about his \r\nmother. ",
        "Eve: Hmm! ",
        "Ian: What's the matter? ",
        "Eve: Oh, my gosh. ",
        "Ian: What? What's the matter? ",
        "Eve: Our baby just kicked. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: How do you feel? ",
        "Jack: How do you think I feel? Jamal, I just drank blood. Oh, my -- I can't \r\nbelieve this. ",
        "Jamal: Jack, the pain. How's the pain? ",
        "Jack: It's gone. All along, this is what I needed -- blood. Oh, my gosh. So \r\nit's true. I'm -- I'm a -- ",
        "Jamal: Vampire. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Ok, so -- so now that we know, we can try to figure out what to \r\ndo. ",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, maybe we can call some help line. Maybe -- ",
        "Jamal: Just calm down for a second, ok? ",
        "Jack: Look, all that matters now is Livvie and keeping her safe from Caleb \r\nand from me. ",
        "Jamal: What are you talking about? ",
        "Jack: Look, Jamal, now that I know what I am, I'm afraid to be around her. \r\nCaleb might not -- ",
        "Livvie: Jack -- did I just hear you mention Caleb? How do you know him? ",
        "",
        "Caleb: How could you let another woman wear Olivia's dress? Look at me, \r\nMichael. What? Your precious Eve, she doesn't have her own clothes? Or are you \r\nnow running a thrift store as well as a church? ",
        "Michael: Eve and Ian were married here. It was a blessed event. She wore the \r\ndress -- ",
        "Caleb: That dress was sacred to me! To Olivia's memory. ",
        "Michael: I'll get it back, Caleb. I will. ",
        "Caleb: You don't understand. That dress meant everything to me, Michael, \r\neverything. And now it's ruined! It's ruined. ",
        "Michael: Wait. Where are you going? ",
        "Caleb: To kiss the bride. ",
        "Michael: I won't let you hurt Eve. ",
        "Caleb: That's sweet, Michael. That's real sweet. You think you can stop me?\r\n",
        "Michael: I'm the only one who can. ",
        "Caleb: You wouldn't do that. Destroying your twin is like -- it's like \r\ndestroying a part of yourself, Michael. And destruction's not part of your gig.\r\n",
        "Michael: Never forget that I know your secret, Caleb. And if pushed far \r\nenough, I'll do whatever it takes to protect Eve. Now, do you understand me? ",
        "Caleb: I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a couple hours. But if that \r\ndress is not back by dawn, all hell breaks loose, Michael. All hell breaks \r\nloose. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: So tell me how you know about Caleb. ",
        "Jamal: I -- I told him. Sorry, Livvie. I figured Jack had a right to know if \r\nsome freaky dude was just hitting on you. ",
        "Livvie: Well, it wasn't your place to say anything. Now could you please give \r\nus a minute alone? ",
        "Jamal: I have to stay. I mean, if there's a stalker on the loose, then I'm \r\ngoing to have to know the 411, too. ",
        "Alison: Ok, Jamal, get a clue because I think these two want some privacy.\r\n",
        "Jack: Hey, Jamal, it's all right, man. Go ahead and take Alison home. We'll \r\nbe fine. ",
        "Jamal: Call me right away if you need me. ",
        "Alison: Ok, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Alison: All right, let's go. ",
        "Jamal: All right. My backpack. Just -- thanks. ",
        "Alison: Ok, good night, you guys. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, good night. ",
        "Jamal: Call me. ",
        "Jack: All right, man. You've got to stay away from Caleb. ",
        "Livvie: I am not worried about him. I'm worried about you. Look, Jack, I had \r\na talk with my father tonight about you. ",
        "Jack: Oh, great. I'm sure he probably told you to kick me to the curb, huh?\r\n",
        "Livvie: No. Actually, he understood how much I need to be with you. And I \r\ntold him that when we are together, we can handle anything. You still believe \r\nthat, Jack, don't you? ",
        "Jack: Livvie, stop. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, you stop. Hey. Stop turning away from me. You were there \r\nfor me when I need you. Will you please let me be here for you? ",
        "Jack: I just -- I just need to get my head on straight, all right? But I \r\ndon't want to talk about this. I want you to tell me about Caleb. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb -- he's just a guy that was interested in me, and I told him I \r\nlove you. ",
        "Jack: Jamal said you went to his place. Did he hurt you? I mean, what did he \r\ndo to you? ",
        "Livvie: No! Caleb didn't hurt me. He never would. ",
        "Jack: You don't know that. ",
        "Livvie: Somehow I do. ",
        "Jack: Promise me you'll stay away from him. ",
        "Livvie: Jack -- ",
        "Jack: Promise me. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, you are making way too big a deal out of this. I told him to \r\ntake a hike and he did. End of story. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, for now. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, was Caleb here? Did he say something to you? Is that what this is \r\nall about? ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- look, I just want you to be safe. Just -- ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I'm fine. In fact, my dad suggested that I move in with him for \r\na little while. ",
        "Jack: That's good. I mean, you don't need to be alone. ",
        "Livvie: But what I'm thinking is I'd be a lot safer if I were here with you.\r\n",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Livvie: What, you don't want me here? ",
        "Jack: No, it's just that the place is kind of small. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, and you need to get your head on straight. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you just know that I meant what I said, no matter what's going \r\non with you. I don't care as long as we're together. ",
        "Jack: I wish it were that simple. I mean, I wish I could make all this go \r\naway. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, there is a way. You could just make love to me, Jack. ",
        "Jack: No. No, no. I can't. I can't. I can't. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Are you still mad about Caleb? Is that why you keep pulling away from \r\nme? ",
        "Jack: No. Livvie, it's not you. Ok? It's me. I'm the one who's completely \r\nmessed up. All right? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. That's fine. So maybe -- maybe we just need to do something \r\nnormal. Tonight it's fourth of July. Let's go out and see fireworks and -- ",
        "Jack: No, Livvie. No. No. I'm -- I'm afraid. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, afraid of what? ",
        "Jack: To get close to you now. ",
        "Livvie: Why now? Why after we have been closer than two people can possibly \r\nbe? Jack, tell me so I understand. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, something's happened to me, something I don't even understand. \r\nAnd until I figure out what it is, I can't take any chances. I'm afraid I have \r\n-- I'm scared I might hurt you. ",
        "Livvie: No. Jack, I told you before that I can look into your eyes and see \r\nwho you are. I can see into your heart and your soul, and I know you would never \r\ndo anything to hurt me. Believe that. ",
        "Jack: I want to, but there's so much up in the air about my health and what \r\nhappened to me when I was missing -- ",
        "Livvie: Hey, hey, I know you're confused about a lot of stuff, Jack, but \r\nplease tell me you are not confused about me. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, no. I love you more than anything. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, good. Because the only way you could hurt me right now is by \r\nrejecting me. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, please. ",
        "Livvie: Show me how much you love, Jack. Trust me. ",

        "Caller: Hello, Madame Alicia? See, I'm thinking of getting married, but I'm \r\nhaving second thoughts. What should I do? ",
        "Lucy: You should dump his lying tushy because -- you really should just back \r\nto Indiana because he's cheating on you. ",
