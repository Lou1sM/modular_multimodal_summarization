        "Kevin: Lucy, come on in. ",
        "Lucy: Doc! Oh, my goodness. Thank God you're all right. You're ok, right? ",
        "Kevin: Of course I'm ok. ",
        "Lucy: Everything's fine, right? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Lucy, please keep it down. Livvie's upstairs. She's trying to \r\nsleep. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, why -- didn't you get my messages?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Then why didn't you call me back and let me know that you're fine, \r\nyou're ok? ",
        "Kevin: I did. ",
        "Lucy: No, you didn't. I was awake all night. I would have known. You did? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, and for somebody who was awake all night, you sounded pretty \r\nasleep to me. In fact, you just mumbled something and then you hung up on me.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, I didn't do that because I was -- awake. Wait a minute. I do \r\nremember -- I think I remember that phone call, but I thought it was a dream \r\nbecause I had the most incredibly active dream life last night. ",
        "Kevin: Why do you do this, Kevin? Because you love her, Kevin. Care to share, \r\nLucy? ",
        "Lucy: I figured out another piece of the puzzle. ",
        "Kevin: The puzzle? ",
        "Lucy: The big puzzle. The one about the Stranger card and why it keeps \r\npopping up. See, I was just sitting there, you know, kind of reading my tarot \r\ncards, and I was listening to this psychic call-in show. You know, the -- \r\nactually, it's kind of more like an infomercial maybe, but they're on cable TV \r\nlate at night, you know? ",
        "Kevin: Well, I usually watch the old movie channels, but please, go on. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I know that, but this woman came on -- a psychic named Madame \r\nAlicia. Now, first I thought maybe she was just this big, fat, you know, \r\nwindbag, doesn't know what she's doing because anybody could do -- you know \r\nwhat? I could do one of those psychic call-in shows. I mean, if you can see at \r\nall with your mind instead of your eyes, which you really don't need to do --\r\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Kevin: The point? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! The point is there I am, Doc, I'm doing my tarot card reading, \r\nright? And all of a sudden, I somehow connect with Madame Alicia on the air. \r\nShe's on the air. I'm at home, and we connect. Do you see? And we both came to \r\nthis incredible conclusion right at the same time. ",
        "Kevin: Which is? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know exactly. But -- but what it has to do with is a baby boy.\r\n",
        "",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Eve: Gee, I'm thinking maybe I should stay pregnant forever. I could get used \r\nto this. ",
        "Ian: Oh, no, you don't. As soon as you have this baby, I'm sending you back \r\nto work, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Ok, are you going to keep calling me Lambert now that I'm officially a \r\nThornhart? ",
        "Ian: This is what I'm going to do. ",
        "Eve: What are you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! ",
        "Ian: Ok. Welcome home, Dr. Lambert, Mrs. Thornhart. ",
        "Eve: Thank you, Dr. Thornhart. ",
        "Ian: I love you, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Don't ever stop. ",
        "Eve: Oh, man. I don't know if it's junior here or Michael's visit last night \r\nthat kept me up. ",
        "Ian: What do you mean? ",
        "Eve: Well, I just couldn't stop thinking about Michael and how upset his \r\nbrother got that I wore that wedding dress. I mean, I didn't know it was his old \r\ngirlfriend's. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, maybe we should stay away from those brothers for a while.\r\n",
        "Eve: We can't blame Michael for his brother being such a wack job. ",
        "Ian: I'm not blaming Michael. But his brother desecrated the church, left him \r\nin the basement to die, so I don't know what else he's capable of. And I don't \r\nlike the idea of Caleb being anywhere near you or our child. ",

        "Caleb's Voice: Given you a little taste of the good life. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: I can't stop thinking about you. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: Don't even try. ",
        "Gabriela's Voice: But I miss you so much when you're gone. ",

        "Gabriela: What? ",
        "Chris: I have a job for you. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. ",
        "Chris: Now, you know we're understaffed, so don't give me any hassles on \r\nthis. They need you down at the blood bank, ok? ",
        "Gabriela: No problems here, doctor. ",
        "Karen: Think she'll listen to us? ",
        "Frank: Well, we have to try. We promised Joe we'd keep an eye on Gabby. Hey, \r\nGabby. ",
        "Gabriela: If you're here to talk about Joe, I'm not interested. ",
        "Frank: Well, that's too bad because he's my brother and this messed him up \r\npretty good. ",
        "Karen: Frank -- ",
        "Gabriela: I'm sorry, but he's really better off. ",
        "Karen: Joe's just worried about you, Gabby. We all are. I mean, this has all \r\nbeen so sudden with you and this new man. ",
        "Gabriela: I know what I'm doing. ",
        "Frank: Don't you care about Joe at all? ",
        "Gabriela: I will always care about him. ",
        "Frank: Then why did you dump him? ",
        "Gabriela: You know, I can't talk right now. It's really none of your \r\nbusiness, either. I'll get that! ",

        "",
        "Jack: What are those for? ",
        "Jamal: To help us figure out a way how to dust this fool, Caleb. ",
        "Jack: I've been working on it, too. Actually, I was just out of here. ",

        "Jack: I'm going to drive this through that bastard's heart. ",

        "Karen: Gabby, I'm sorry, but isn't this a little junior high? ",

        "Gabriela: That's right. ",
        "Karen: Well, at least you know his name now. ",
        "Gabriela: You have no right to judge me or who I'm with. ",
        "Karen: Gabby, we're not judging you. I thought we were all friends. Friends \r\ncare for each other. And if this is the guy you want, then you're right, it is \r\nyour business. But, hey, I'd like to meet him. ",
        "Gabriela: Caleb likes to be alone. We mostly hang out at my place. ",
        "Frank: You don't go out? ",
        "Gabriela: We don't have to. Caleb says I'm all he needs. Look, I really got \r\nto go. ",
        "Karen: Married. ",
        "Frank: Huh? ",
        "Karen: He says he needs her. They never go out in public. Married. Gabby gave \r\nup Joe for some player. ",

        "Karen: Oh, what's going on? Where are you? ",
        "Eve: I'm at Ian's. I was wondering if you might be able to slip away for a \r\ncouple minutes. ",
        "Ian: Please. I can only deal with these pregnancy hormones for so long. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Karen: Tell Ian I would love to rescue him, but I'm with Frank. ",
        "Eve: Well, you can bring him, too. I have news. ",
        "Karen: Well, good news, I hope. ",
        "Eve: Just come over. ",
        "Karen: We'll be right there. Bye. Is that ok? ",

        "Chris: Why? Has something happened? ",

        "Chris: Well, don't. ",
        "Sam: Well, what am I supposed to do? Draw a target on my back? ",

        "Jack: Yeah, what's stopping me, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Him, for one. Jack, this guy is a full-fledged vampire. Ok, you're \r\nlike a -- like half vampire, man. You can't go out there doing all the tricks he \r\ncan do like disappearing and stuff like that. ",
        "Jack: No, no, I can if I become what he is. ",

        "Lucy: Ok. There it is again, the Stranger card and -- Doc, the Baby Boy card. \r\nAgain. Right there. This is what happens every single time I do it. ",
        "Kevin: What does that mean? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I'm not exactly sure. The Stranger card, it means the \r\npotential for real evil. And the Baby Boy card is -- it means innocence \r\npersonified. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, did you know Innocence has a ketchup stain on the back? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, so I like to eat a lot when I'm doing my tarot cards, but, Doc, I \r\nthink I need to talk to this Madame Alicia. Just consult with her. Set up a \r\nmeeting. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, to be a fly on the wall for that. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I wish I could invite you, but I can't. You'd destroy the astral \r\nbalance. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I wouldn't dream of interrupting the harmonic convergence -- \r\nonly because I'd rather be here for Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Yeah, that's a good idea. How long do you think she's going to \r\nstay? ",
        "Kevin: I don't know. As long as she needs to. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Would you be honest with me? Do you think Jack presents any kind \r\nof real danger to Livvie? ",
        "Kevin: That depends on what kind of danger you're talking about. Which \r\nreminds me, I want to check on her, make sure she's ok. ",

        "Lucy: Uh, you know, there's a filling station right down the road there. \r\nThey'd probably help you there. ",
        "Caleb: Then maybe I could use your phone to call them. ",
