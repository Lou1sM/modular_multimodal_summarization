        "Colleen: What are you doing? ",
        "Karen: Uh -- nothing, really. Do you have a room available? ",
        "Colleen: Available for what? ",
        "Karen: Just -- uh -- it's legitimate. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Sure. ",
        "Colleen: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. With him involved? I don't think so. ",
        "Karen: It's hospital business. Cross my heart. ",
        "Colleen: Ok. Then you've got to let me know what it is as soon as you do. ",
        "Eve: What? What -- what what is? ",
        "Colleen: If it's a boy or a girl. 614 is open. ",
        "Eve: Thanks, Colleen. ",
        "Ian: Right. ",

        "Gabriela: Oh, good. I was afraid I'd come at a bad time. ",
        "Lucy: No, not at all. Do you want something -- something to drink? ",
        "Gabriela: No, thanks, but there is something else I'd like. ",
        "Lucy: What's that? ",
        "Gabriela: For you to accept my apology. My performance at the Nurses Ball was \r\na little -- ",
        "Lucy: Hmm. Does the word \"inappropriate\" ring a bell? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know what got into me. It must've been the tequila shooters \r\nI downed for courage. ",
        "Lucy: Well, we saw a lot of that on you and a lot of other things not on you.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: I'm really sorry. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, I have done a few things up on that stage that I'd just \r\nas soon forget myself. ",
        "Gabriela: Then you're not mad at me? ",
        "Lucy: No, I can't be mad at anybody at this point. Listen, we raised more \r\nmoney than ever for the Nurses Ball, despite everything that happened. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Lucy: Excuse me, I need to get this. Hello. Yes, this is Lucy. Madame Alicia, \r\nthank you so much for getting back to me so quickly. Listen, could you just hold \r\non a minute? I have to take this. Excuse me. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, take your time. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, thanks. Hi. Listen, this is going to be very interesting to you and \r\nvery important. Hi. Listen, I am the person that you connected with so strongly \r\nlast night on your psychic show. You know, your television infomercial thingy? \r\nYes! Yes, exactly. About the baby boy and this -- yes, that's it. And listen, \r\nthe stranger -- that's something I'm getting -- no, I want your help on the \r\nstranger, but -- I know it's $1.99 a minute, but that's not the point. That's \r\nnot what -- no. Madame Alicia, listen to me. You said yourself we had a very \r\nstrong connection, and I feel it, too. That's why I really believe you're the \r\nonly person I can trust with this. Terrific. I would love to meet with you. I -- \r\nI have to go to General Hospital, and then I could meet you at the Recovery \r\nRoom, say, two hours? Terrific. Yeah, I know I sound a little anxious to meet \r\nwith you, but I am very anxious because I really have a feeling that this is \r\nsomething that is very, very urgent. ",

        "Livvie: Gabby. Hey, what's up? ",
        "Gabriela: Livvie, hi. I'm sorry for popping over without calling first, but I \r\nfound this at the Nurses Ball, and I've been trying to get it back to you \r\nforever. ",
        "Livvie: Thanks, but it's not mine. ",
        "Gabriela: It's not? ",
        "Livvie: I've never seen it before. ",
        "Gabriela: Really? I could've sworn I saw you wearing it. ",
        "Livvie: Nope. ",
        "Gabriela: Boy, I must really be losing it. Ever since I started seeing this \r\nnew guy, I can't even think straight. ",
        "Livvie: A new guy? I thought you and Joe were -- ",
        "Gabriela: Well, we were. We were, but there's somebody else now. And, Livvie, \r\nhe is just so amazing. ",
        "Livvie: I thought Joe was pretty amazing. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, he was, in his sweet, boy-next-door kind of a way. But this \r\nguy -- I don't even know how to describe it. He's -- he is beyond handsome, \r\nbeyond sexy, and, oh, my God, he has got the most incredible blue eyes I have \r\never seen. They just draw you in like I don't know what. It's nothing I've ever \r\nexperienced before. But I probably shouldn't be talking like this so soon after \r\n-- ",
        "Livvie: No, please. Tell me more. ",

        "Sam: Jack, I know you're probably a little mad at me, but I don't want any \r\ntrouble. ",
        "Jack: Too late, Sam. ",
        "Sam: I don't want any more trouble. I mean, I've seen what you can do. ",
        "Jack: You haven't seen the half of it. ",
        "Sam: I don't have any money on me. I can get you some, whatever you want. \r\nJust leave me alone. ",
        "Jack: I don't want your money. ",
        "Sam: Then what do you want? ",
        "Jack: Hmm -- someone just like you. ",

        "Jack: I had to do it, Jamal. I had to find some miserable person who no one \r\nwould miss. ",
        "Jamal: What, somebody to kill? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Jack, where is she? Where's the lady that screamed? What did you do to \r\nher? ",
        "Jack: I did nothing. All right, I didn't do anything. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Jack: Jamal, man, I had a chance. Sam was right here. I was hungry for blood, \r\nman. I wanted to kill her. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. You didn't want to. You thought you had to, Jack. ",
        "Jack: I do have to. Jamal, I have to kill in order to cross over to be like \r\nhim. ",
        "Jamal: You don't want to be like Caleb. You don't want to be a freaking \r\nvampire, man. ",
        "Jack: Jamal, that's the only way I have against him. That's the only chance I \r\nstand. But I didn't do it. I just let it go. ",
        "Jamal: You couldn't do it, huh? ",
        "Jack: No. I couldn't. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Jack, you did the right thing, ok? Sam -- she's not my favorite \r\nperson, but killing her's not right, man. ",
        "Jack: So what do we do now, Jamal? Huh? How do we stop Caleb from getting to \r\nLivvie and turning her -- man, I'm not going to let this happen. I won't. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie would never want you to kill anybody, Jack. ",
        "Jack: There's no other way, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I saw what happened to her when she thought she lost you. Ok? It \r\ndestroyed her. If you love her as much as you say you do, you wouldn't put her \r\nthrough that again. Besides, Jack, she's safe now. She's at her dad's. Ok? \r\nThat'll give us some time -- time enough to figure out what to do with Caleb.\r\n",
        "Jack: Yeah, she's safe. Caleb can't get to her at Kevin's. ",

        "Gabriela: Have you ever met someone and just instantly you knew you would \r\nfollow them to the ends of the earth, no matter what? Someone who filled you \r\nwith the most exquisite longing you have ever known, who makes you feel like \r\nnothing matters? Nothing except the powerful connection the two of you share?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yes. Yes, I have. I have Jack. Jack makes me feel that way. ",
        "Gabriela: No. ",
        "Livvie: Excuse me? ",
        "Gabriela: What I'm talking about, it's not like that. It's not like being \r\nwith an ordinary man. It's different. ",
        "Livvie: Well, different how? ",
        "Gabriela: This man has a way of looking at me like he sees right through me, \r\nright to my very soul. And when he touches me, it's electric. I want nothing \r\nmore than to be his, totally and completely his. ",
        "Gabriela: Just thinking about him fills me with the most incredible \r\nexcitement. I would give anything to see him again. ",

        "Livvie: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. ",
        "Lucy: Really? You don't look fine. You look a little pale, in fact. ",

        "Lucy: Why don't I stay? You know, I'd like to stay and just hang out. ",
        "Livvie: No, please, Lucy, go do what you have to do. I don't want to be an \r\ninconvenience to anybody, you know? ",

        "Livvie: I'll call you. Thanks for being so concerned. ",
