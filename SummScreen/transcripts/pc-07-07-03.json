        "Although Ricky isn't interested in getting back with the band, Caz points out that things might be different now that Joshua is out of the picture. Ricky is stunned to see Casey beckon to him from across the room. When he finds her outside the club, she urges him to reconsider his decision about the band so that he can follow his dream. Ricky is the only person who can see her, and while they share some sweet kisses, Caz comes along and finds him seemingly all alone in some strange contortions. Jamal is startled when a woman crashes through the ceiling onto his bed. He realizes that Jack didn't warn his new employee about the loose floorboards and weak floor. After she scurries away in embarrassment, Jamal cautions himself not to even think about a relationship with her. Going to the Elixir for something to eat, Jamal is pleasantly surprised when his waitress turns out to be the woman who crashed into his apartment. When she admits to her intention to pay for repairs, Jamal assures her that he'll fix things with Jack. He orders the wrong thing and is surprised when she brings exactly what he meant to order. Alison tells Olivia off for always making her so miserable. She believes that Rafe blames her for what happened and that he can no longer trust her, and her new insecurities feed Olivia's own relationship doubts. When she collapses, she doesn't believe Olivia's assertion that she's suffering withdrawal symptoms. When Caleb confronts Rafe about double-crossing him, Rafe states that all bets are off now that Joshua is gone. Caleb points out how dangerous the ring could be if it falls into the wrong hands. When Rafe comes home, Alison tries to talk to him about their relationship, but he brushes her off with the claim that he's tired and hungry. Olivia tries to talk to Caleb, who ignores her by picking up his guitar and putting on his headphones."

        "Caz: Whoa. Take it easy, tequila man. Things aren't that ugly.",
        "Ricky: Says you.",
        "Caz: Hmm. I'm right. We're not going to miss Joshua, and the fans are all over the band getting back together.",
        "Ricky: Hey, look, Caz, maybe that works for you, all right, but I can't go there again, not after everything that's happened.",
        "Caz: Well, maybe things will be different this time. I mean, with Joshua out of the picture, we could --",
        "Ricky: I bet you haven't talked to Caleb.",
        "Caz: We will. Especially once he hears that \"Rolling Stone\" and \"People\" called.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, we're real rock stars.",
        "Caz: Look, man, I know you're a little bummed about that girl that died --",
        "Ricky: Karen.",
        "Caz: Yeah, Karen -- you guys were close. And Casey just disappearing -- but you love playing music.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I never said that i didn't, all right? It's just the rest of it is a bunch of b.s., all right? I would give up any cover of \"rolling stone\" to see Casey again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Whoa --",
        "[Jamal coughs]",
        "Woman: What happened? What are you doing here?",
        "Jamal: Well, this is my apartment. What are you doing upstairs in the storage room?",
        "Woman: I -- I was just putting some stuff away for Jack, and I just -- I don't know -- I came --",
        "Woman: No, no.",
        "Jamal: Oh, my God. Are you ok? Are you --",
        "Woman: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess. You kind of broke my fall.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I've always liked that bed.",
        "Woman: I'm so sorry. I'm really, really sorry.",
        "Jamal: Don't worry about it.",
        "Woman: God, I mean, he just hired me, and I really don't want to lose my job.",
        "Jamal: No, you're fine, you're fine. Just -- just flash that pretty smile and you'll be fine.",
        "Woman: Yeah, ok. Again, I'm sorry. Look, if that's --",
        "Jamal: Yeah, right here.",
        "Woman: Ok.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Woman: All right.",
        "Jamal: You're cool.",
        "Jamal: All right, all right, all right. No, don't even think about it. Times have changed. I'm a vampire. Can't even think about that -- even though she fell right into my bed.",
        "[Jamal laughs]",
        "Jamal: The ring. The ring. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I want the ring.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Livvie: I know you have it, Alison. Give it to me.",
        "Alison: How many times have I told you, I do not have the ring.",
        "Livvie: Oh, please. You know, Caleb may believe every lying word that drips off your tongue, but I know you better. You were the last one to see it on Joshua's hand, and it just magically disappeared? I don't think so.",
        "Alison: You know what?",
        "Livvie: Hand it over!",
        "Alison: I'll tell you something. I have just been to hell and back, and I do not need your paranoid ravings.",
        "Livvie: And I don't need you pushing me.",
        "Alison: Look, I will shove you anytime I want. You know why, Livvie? Because you never seem to hear me. You need to stop causing trouble for me, you need to stop threatening me, and you have got to make me stop feeling so incredibly miserable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You lied. You broke your promise. The good guy usually played by Rafe Kovich came in here to find the ring for himself.",
        "Rafe: What powers does it have, Caleb, huh?",
        "Caleb: Our agreement was I help you get back Alison, you help me get the ring. No questions asked.",
        "Rafe: Ok, now, here's the thing -- you've obviously been looking for it for a while. I mean, you were here before looking for it and you're here now. It might help if you put a little light on, huh? Now, we can probably assume it's not here.",
        "Caleb: So what's your best guess?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. And to tell you the truth, now that I think about it, I don't really care. Good riddance.",
        "Caleb: Not so fast. I'm not finished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Alison, get -- sit up. Are you done, or are you going to keep raving until you implode?",
        "Alison: I don't know what's wrong with me. I just -- I keep on feeling so dizzy and I can't focus.",
        "Livvie: You're going through withdrawal symptoms.",
        "Alison: What do you know? You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Livvie: Don't I? Little miss Alison on a rant about how useless love is? I don't think so. Please, you're coming down from the drugs Joshua gave you.",
        "Alison: I'm not some sort of junkie.",
        "Livvie: Look, you listed your symptoms. Don't tell me you didn't think something was wrong, that something didn't make you stab your boyfriend in the chest and in the face. Hello? Am I talking to brick wall here?",
        "Alison: I didn't know what I was doing, but I -- I still did do it. I didn't mean to.",
        "Livvie: Well, I mean, he did set you up. But you're right, you did do it.",
        "Alison: None of it seemed real. It just didn't.",
        "Livvie: Oh, God, are you feeling guilty. I mean, Alison trashing love?",
        "Alison: I hate to break it to you, but you actually need to go to school to be a shrink. You can't just inherit that. So if I were you, I'd just keep your opinions to yourself, ok?",
        "Livvie: Ok. You, my dear, are right on the edge.",
        "Alison: I really didn't know what I was doing. I didn't. But I can't blame Rafe for not forgiving me.",
        "Livvie: Are you serious? I mean, he actually blames you for what happened?",
        "Alison: No, he says that he doesn't. He says he forgives me, but, I mean, honestly, how could you?",
        "(missing part here, will get it later)",
        "Alison: ....enough to defeat you and Caleb. When I was willing to sacrifice myself to Joshua, that monster, and give him everything he wanted, all to save the man that I love. And when I almost killed Rafe myself, and then he ended up saving me anyway.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, in the end. Now the two of you can live your happily ever after, that stupid storybook love of yours. What is your problem, Alison?",
        "Alison: My problem is the same as yours. Rafe and Caleb -- they are off together. They didn't tell either one of us, which means that this ring means more to them than we do.",
        "Livvie: Oh, God, this is -- this is going to be one huge pity party, isn't it, Alison? Alison?",
        "Alison: Don't --",
        "Livvie: Alison? Alison!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You just don't get it. That ring is a family heirloom. It's passed down to me from my father and his father before him.",
        "Rafe: And when did you put such a high price on sentiment?",
        "Caleb: You know I've always valued history.",
        "Rafe: Ok, I'll give you that.",
        "Caleb: The ring is exactly what I told you -- no more, no less. And it doesn't matter because we had a deal.",
        "Rafe: It's a deal I fully intended to honor, too, because getting Alison back was all that was ever important to me. Do you understand?",
        "Caleb: Then you should help me. Help me find it.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what? The deal was to get the ring from Joshua. Now Joshua's gone. The ring has disappeared. So as far as I'm concerned, all bets are off!",
        "Caleb: What have you become, some kind of lawyer fumbling with technicalities? You used to be a man of your word!",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I used to be a lot of things.",
        "Caleb: The bet is off when I say it's off!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: One veggie burger, fries, well done, and a draft --",
        "Jamal: Veggie burger?",
        "[Jamal laughs]",
        "Woman: Oh, no, you ordered the tuna.",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, this is what I wanted. I ordered the tuna. Tuna was a mistake.",
        "Woman: No, no, no, I blew it again. I'm so --",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, no, seriously, it's like you read my mind or something.",
        "Woman: Come on, you're just being nice.",
        "Jamal: No, I'm not being nice. I mean, I am nice, but I'm not being nice about this.",
        "Woman: You know what? You just must think I am the world's most terrible waitress --",
        "Jamal: No.",
        "Woman: Or a complete idiot.",
        "Jamal: No, no, you're just new. You'll be fine.",
        "Woman: You think?",
        "Jamal: Yes. When I came to Port Charles, I was -- I was all over the place. It just takes you a little bit of time to get your bearings straight and you'll be fine. All right? But thank you for the veggie burger. It's perfect.",
        "Woman: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Alison, get -- sit up. Are you done, or are you going to keep raving until you implode?",
        "Alison: I don't know what's wrong with me. I just -- I keep on feeling so dizzy and I can't focus.",
        "Livvie: You're going through withdrawal symptoms.",
        "Alison: What do you know? You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Livvie: Don't I? Little Miss Alison on a rant about how useless love is? I don't think so. Please, you're coming down from the drugs Joshua gave you.",
        "Alison: I'm not some sort of junkie.",
        "Livvie: Look, you listed your symptoms. Don't tell me you didn't think something was wrong, that something didn't make you stab your boyfriend in the chest and in the face. Hello? Am I talking to brick wall here?",
        "Alison: I didn't know what I was doing, but I -- I still did do it. I didn't mean to.",
        "Livvie: Well, I mean, he did set you up. But you're right, you did do it.",
        "Alison: None of it seemed real. It just didn't.",
        "Livvie: Oh, God, are you feeling guilty. I mean, Alison trashing love?",
        "Alison: I hate to break it to you, but you actually need to go to school to be a shrink. You can't just inherit that. So if I were you, I'd just keep your opinions to yourself, ok?",
        "Livvie: Ok. You, my dear, are right on the edge.",
        "Alison: I really didn't know what I was doing. I didn't. But I can't blame Rafe for not forgiving me.",
        "Livvie: Are you serious? I mean, he actually blames you for what happened?",
        "Alison: No, he says that he doesn't. He says he forgives me, but, I mean, honestly, how could you? How could anyone after something like that?",
        "Livvie: Don't be a jerk, please. You guys are, like, the love story of the century. Of course he forgives you.",
        "Alison: But what if he doesn't, you know? I don't even know why I'm asking you this. Like you even care. You're only happy --",
        "Livvie: No. No, no, no, no, no, Alison, I do. I do care. I, like -- I think that you guys should, you know, work this out, make everything right between you.",
        "Alison: Why? Why do you care?",
        "Livvie: I don't know. It's just that it kind of balances everything out, you know? I just think that you should probably trust what he's telling you. And remember, his stab wounds, they're going to heal.",
        "Alison: But what about trust?",
        "Livvie: Yeah? Did you ask him?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I did, and he said that it doesn't matter. It doesn't make any difference that I stabbed him.",
        "Livvie: Ok, then why would he lie?",
        "Alison: Why would he leave as soon as I fell asleep?",
        "Livvie: Oh, God, get over it. If that's the worst of your problems, then you're halfway home.",
        "Alison: What about the other half?",
        "Livvie: Well, just don't give him room to question how you feel. Love him 1,000% and make sure he gets it. That's all that matters right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: We had a deal. I set that bastard up for you.",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm, and I sent him to hell. That cleans the slate between us.",
        "Caleb: You know, when you were an angel, at least you played by some rules.",
        "Rafe: Rules? What rules? Come on, you should know there are no rules here. You set it up that way.",
        "Caleb: Oh, ok. If that's the way you want it.",
        "Rafe: Oh, come on, man. We're wasting each other's time. Ok, I mean, look at us! We're just a couple of fools. We can't kill each other, we can hardly hurt each other, so, please, please, can we just stay out of each other's way?",
        "Caleb: It'll never be over between you and me, will it?",
        "Rafe: No, no, I guess not. You know, maybe not. But at least it's an even playing field. I have a feeling that ring will tilt the balance in your favor. So as far as I'm concerned, it's ok if we never find it because it'll only makes things worse.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. Did you ever think that maybe that ring has fallen into the hands of someone who doesn't know just how powerful it can be? Or worse yet, maybe does know how powerful it is and plans on abusing it? You see, Rafe, doing nothing to find the ring might just be the most dangerous thing of all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: All right, all right. This is just a dream, right? You're not real.",
        "Casey: Do I feel like a dream? Huh?",
        "Ricky: Yes. No. I don't know. I'm the only one who can see you.",
        "Casey: Yeah? So what? Who cares?",
        "Ricky: Oh, God, you're right, you're right. You're right, this is all that matters. God, how do I get you to stay?",
        "Casey: Oh, I miss you, drummer boy. I miss you.",
        "Ricky: Casey, I got to tell you, I've been having such a tough time since you've been gone.",
        "Casey: No, baby. No, you got to look at the good news, ok? The whole thing about the band getting back together, right? Right?",
        "Ricky: No, no. That doesn't mean anything anymore.",
        "Casey: It what? Ricky, no, it has to. See, right here, where you live in your soul, it's the things.",
        "Ricky: No, not anymore it doesn't.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Ricky: It doesn't matter.",
        "Casey: Ricky, it has to. Otherwise, why do we even go through all this pain? Didn't i tell you it would be ok to follow your dreams? I told you it would be safe. I'd watch your back, right?",
        "Ricky: Yeah, but was that really you?",
        "Casey: As real as I am now. Sweetie, as real as I am right now. Please. Please, Ricky. Take the chance that you can be happy doing your music, ok? Do not lose that. Don't lose that because of me. Don't.",
        "Ricky: All right. All right. Fine, I'll do it, I'll do it.",
        "Caz: What are you doing?",
        "Ricky: What? Oh, man, check it out, look -- look who's back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Jamal: Ahem.",
        "Woman: So, can I get you something else?",
        "Jamal: Yeah -- actually, no. I'm going to pay that bill, and I'm going to get out of here, all right? There you go. That should cover it.",
        "Woman: Wow. Thank you.",
        "Jamal: Welcome to Port Charles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You're up. You ok? I just -- I went back to find the ring.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I figured.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, so -- anyway, it wasn't there. Caleb's pretty determined to find it, so --",
        "Alison: I don't want to talk about the ring, and I don't want to talk about Caleb. Rafe, I really want to talk about what's going on between you and me.",
        "Rafe: Oh, ok, stop right there. There's nothing. There's nothing going on between us. Something happened to us. It's just -- well, I think the best thing for us to do is just put it in the past so we can move on with our lives, ok? Yeah. Let me get you something to eat. Do you want something?",
        "Alison: No, I don't -- I don't want anything to eat. Rafe, I know I put scars on you. I put them on your face --",
        "Rafe: I'm ok.",
        "Alison: I put them on your body, I put them on your face, and I know -- I know I put them on your heart.",
        "Rafe: I'm ok, all right? Come here. I'm just -- I'm tired and I'm hungry, ok?",
        "Alison: I really -- I really hope that you know how much I love you.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I do.",
        "Alison: And we both know that Joshua did something to me that made me capable of hurting you, but I think we need to talk about it. I want to talk about what's going on with us.",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok. You know what's going on? I love you. I always have, I always will. It's been a long day, though, you know, for both of us, so -- I'm just tired, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Thought you'd be asleep.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I was, until I woke up and you weren't here again.",
        "Caleb: Well, I'm home now.",
        "Livvie: You went back there, didn't you? You went to find the ring. After everything we said to each other, it was just too seductive, wasn't it? Caleb, answer me. What are you -- don't walk away like that.",
        "Caleb: Olivia, if I wanted to talk about it, I would talk about it. But I don't, not now.",
        "Livvie: Ok. So you don't want to talk about the ring. You don't want to talk about Alison. You don't want to talk about our relationship, whatever that means. So what would you like me to do, Caleb? Am I supposed to just call and make an appointment? Because that's what I'll do.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Ian: What I'm asking you, man to man, is to wipe the slate clean. Let's stop pushing each other.",
        "Woman: I'm afraid I have a rather serious complaint against this household.",
        "Man: Nobody move!",
        "Second man: I wouldn't try it, pal! Not unless you and all your friends here want to die!"
