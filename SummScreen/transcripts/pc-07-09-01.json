        "Gabriela: Make it red. ",

        "Jamal: No, no. No, I'm not icing you, ok? You can just forget it. ",
        "Jack: Jamal, once we figure out a way to take Caleb out, you've got to take \r\nme out. ",
        "Jamal: No. No. You're my friend. ",
        "Jack: That's why you can't let me turn into some bloodsucking vampire. ",
        "Jamal: It's not going to come to that. ",
        "Jack: There's no way to stop this, Jamal. This change is coming over me. It's \r\ntoo late. ",
        "Jamal: All right, we'll figure out a way, ok? Just chill for a second. ",
        "Jack: Jamal, listen to me, man. Look, once I know Livvie's safe and we've \r\nsent Count Dracula back to hell, you got to do the last thing. You got to \r\npromise me. ",
        "Jamal: I'm not driving a stake through your heart. Ok? I'm not going to sit \r\nhere and watch my friend die. ",
        "Jack: You have to. Because of what I might become and what I might do to \r\nLivvie, man. Don't you get it, Jamal? Killing me might be the only way to keep \r\nLivvie safe. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: You were expecting me? How did you even know I was coming here? ",
        "Caleb: I know you, every beat of your heart. ",
        "Livvie: I kept thinking about you. Then I found myself coming here. I don't \r\neven know why. ",
        "Caleb: I think you do. ",
        "Livvie: Everybody's warned me to stay away from you. ",
        "Caleb: And yet here you are. What does that tell you, Olivia? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. ",
        "Caleb: Do you know why your heart is racing? You're here for one undeniable \r\nreason. You want me as much as I want you. ",
        "",
        "Man: Buy you a drink? ",
        "Gabriela: I've already got one. ",
        "Man: Come on, sweetheart. My name's Dave. And you're -- ",
        "Gabriela: History. ",
        "Gabriela: Now, there's someone more to my taste. ",
        "Woman: Hey, you want to beat it? ",
        "Gabriela: No, I want to dance. ",
        "Woman: Well, get your own man. ",
        "Gabriela: I want this one. Dance with me. ",
        "Woman: Back off. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm not talking to you. If you enjoy breathing, you'll get lost.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Follow me. ",
        "Man: You don't waste much time. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't hear you complaining. I haven't seen you around here \r\nbefore. ",
        "Man: Just passing through. ",
        "Gabriela: Good. I want to be the only one you know in town. ",
        "Man: I like a girl who knows what she wants. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, then, you'll love me because I know exactly what I want. But \r\nright now I need some air, so why don't we go outside and get some? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Would you just stop talking all crazy? Ok, you're not going to go all \r\ngoth on me, and you're not going to turn into a vampire. And there's no way in \r\nhell, Jack, that you're going to ever hurt Livvie. ",
        "Jack: But I almost did with Sam. Jamal, when I saw Sam's fear, I could taste \r\nit. And it tasted just like blood. And I crave it so bad that it hurts. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you didn't hurt her, and that's the point, right? ",
        "Man: Hey, could I get some help here? ",
        "Jamal: No, we're closed. ",
        "Man: I just wanted to see if you guys -- ",
        "Jamal: Look, I said we're closed, so beat it, all right? ",
        "Man: Same to you, pal. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, whatever, dude. ",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, Jamal. I hate what this has done, not just to me, but to all \r\nof us. I mean, man, you had a good life. You had a good business. ",
        "Jamal: Look, it's not your fault, ok? It's not like you went out here asking \r\nfor this to happen to you. ",
        "Jack: I tried fighting the hunger. But I wake up every morning thinking about \r\nit, and I go to sleep at night thinking about it -- how to feed it, how to make \r\nthe pain go away. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you got to hang tough, Jack, all right? ",
        "Jack: Jamal, I don't know how much longer I can hang on. This thing is \r\ncontrolling my life. The only way to stop it is to stop me. Permanently. ",
        "Jamal: So, what -- so, what, you're just going to bail? Huh? \"This is hard, \r\nso just kill me?\" ",
        "Jack: I'm turning into a vampire, remember, Jamal? Killing people, liquid \r\ndiets, blood. ",
        "Jamal: You're still the same friend that you've always been. ",
        "Jack: Do the math, Jamal. I went after Sam. I went after my own brother. I \r\nmean, come on, man, how long is it till I start going after my own friends? ",
        "Jamal: That's not going to happen. ",
        "Jack: Tell me, Jamal -- would you be so buddy-buddy if I told you I've been \r\nthinking about feeding on you? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Look, Caleb, I think we got our signals crossed. ",
        "Caleb: Did we? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I am not here because I want you. ",
        "Caleb: You're not? ",
        "Livvie: No, I am in love with Jack. We are -- we are very happy together. ",
        "Caleb: Are you? ",
        "Livvie: I'm here because a woman I know, a nurse at the hospital, told me \r\nabout this man she met. And it sounded like she was in love with him. ",
        "Caleb: Well, who can explain the chemistry between a man and a woman in love?\r\n",
        "Livvie: See, the thing is the man sounded exactly like you. ",
        "Caleb: Well, how did she describe him? ",
        "Livvie: Exciting, handsome, irresistible. ",
        "Caleb: And you thought of me? ",
        "Livvie: Look, I just came here to ask you if you were seducing women all over \r\nPort Charles because it sounds like you are. ",
        "Caleb: Sounds like you're jealous. ",
        "Livvie: I'm not jealous. I'm just curious, that's all. ",
        "Caleb: Because you have no reason to be jealous. I'll admit there have been \r\nmany women in my life. But there's never been anyone like you. ",
        "Livvie: But, Caleb, you hardly even know me. ",
        "Caleb: Do you really believe that? ",
        "Caleb: I can see inside you. I see who you really are. And I think you see \r\nme, too. I know you do. Come on, Olivia. Have a look. What's stopping you? Hmm? \r\nI don't bite. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, it's amazing. The way you talk to me, the way you look at me -- \r\nit's like I've known you forever. It's like -- ",
        "Caleb: Nothing you've ever experienced before. And this is only the \r\nbeginning. Say the word and I'll give you the world. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Caleb. We shouldn't be talking like this. I -- I mean, I am \r\ninvolved with someone wonderful. ",
        "Caleb: Yet you're here with me and not with Jack. Well, that's got to hurt a \r\nguy. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I didn't exactly tell him I was coming here. I wasn't sure he'd \r\nunderstand that -- ",
        "Caleb: It's my face you see in your dreams? ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Caleb: It's my name on your lips when you wake up? ",
        "Livvie: How do you know? ",
        "Caleb: You love Jack. You love him like a -- like a schoolgirl loves. It's \r\nnice. It's sweet. But you want me with the passion of a woman. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb, please. ",
        "Caleb: It's time to grow up, Olivia. It's time.",
        "",
        "Gabriela: I have a little confession to make. I didn't really need any air. I \r\njust wanted to be alone with you. ",
        "Man: Well, you are one hot babe. I never been with a girl like you before.\r\n",
        "Man: You like it rough, huh? ",
        "Man: What did you do to my neck? ",
        "Gabriela: Just a little love bite, something to remember me by. ",
        "Man: Come here, baby. ",
        "Gabriela: No. I've had enough. That's all, folks. ",
        "Man: Hey. I ain't done with you yet. ",
        "Gabriela: But I'm done with you. It's been real. ",
        "",
        "Jack: You know how easy it would be for me to fix this hunger and take a big \r\nbite out of you, huh? ",
        "Jamal: I know it's way past your lunch time and everything. Come on. Go \r\nahead. Go ahead. ",
        "Jack: Stop. How do you know I won't kill you, huh? ",
        "Jamal: I don't. But I'll take my chances. Maybe I was afraid before when I \r\ndidn't know what I was dealing with. But now that I do, I think I'll stick \r\naround. ",
        "Jack: You're taking one hell of a gamble. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I'm betting you can beat this thing with a little help from me. \r\nThat's what I believe. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Jamal, I want to believe that. ",
        "Jamal: All right, Jack, look, look -- you got to keep remembering what we \r\nread in those books, all right? ",
        "Jack: You mean about the talisman? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, some twisted little lucky mojo can let them function in \r\nthe real world. ",
        "Jack: And acts as kind of a protective shield. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. And without it, mere mortals like us can dust those fools.\r\n",
        "Jack: But how do we get Caleb's talisman, huh? We can't just go into his bat \r\ncave and ask him to dish it over. ",
        "Jamal: See, problem is, is that it could be anything. I mean, how do we even \r\nknow where to start looking? ",
        "Jack: Look, ok -- say we find his lucky charm, ok? Caleb is strong as hell.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but you got a -- you got a power that he doesn't have. You got \r\nthe power of love. Jack, you were willing to give your life for Livvie you loved \r\nher so much, and that's powerful. And Livvie loves you, too. Livvie's your lucky \r\ncharm, bro. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. All this time I've been trying to save Livvie, when her love is \r\nthe only thing that can save me. ",
        "Jamal: I rest my case. ",
        "Jack: I'm going to take this guy down. I swear to God I'm going to take Caleb \r\ndown, but I need your help, Jamal. I need you to give me some more blood. It's \r\nthe only way I can stay strong. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Well, I'll go to the hospital and get what you need. ",
        "Jack: Hey. Thanks for sticking by me. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, you would've done the same thing for me. Man, we're going to get \r\nthrough this. ",
        "Jack: We have to -- for Livvie. I'm not going to let Caleb get to her. ",
        "Jamal: All right. And we're going to find his talisman. ",
        "Jack: And then I'm going to drive a stake right through this bastard's heart.\r\n",

        "Caleb: It's ok to let yourself go. Tell me -- how does this feel? ",
        "Livvie: It feels -- it feels like -- ",
        "Caleb: Like you never want it to end? Just forget about everything. Forget \r\nabout what everybody says. Forget about Jack. ",
        "Livvie: No. No. No, I love Jack. Caleb, this isn't right. ",
        "Caleb: I won't force you, Olivia. I want you to come to me willingly, without \r\ndoubt, without the thought of any other man in your mind. And I'll accept \r\nnothing less than all of you, body and soul, a complete surrender. ",
        "Livvie: But you're asking too much of me. ",
        "Caleb: For now. It's not time yet. You're not ready. I'm willing to wait, \r\nwilling to wait for that perfect moment because it will come as surely as you \r\ncame here tonight. ",
        "Livvie: I -- I should probably go home now. ",
        "Caleb: Yes, you should. ",
        "Livvie: So, you want me to go home? ",
        "Caleb: It's not yet the time. ",

        "Man: I thought I hit the freaking jackpot. This girl -- she was a wild \r\nanimal. She even bit me on the neck. Then all of a sudden, just out of nowhere, \r\nman -- ice cubes, cold fish. She wouldn't even let me touch her. ",
        "Caleb: Real piece of work, huh? ",
        "Man: Yeah. Crazy broad. ",
        "Caleb: A woman like that can really shorten your life. You know, I happen to \r\nknow a place where the ladies are a lot more friendly. You interested? ",
        "Man: Yeah. You know what? Let me just settle my tab. ",
