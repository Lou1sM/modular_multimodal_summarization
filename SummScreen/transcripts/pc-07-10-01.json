        "Jamal: This isn't what it looks like. ",
        "Gabriela: Looks like you're trespassing. Only hospital personnel are allowed \r\nin here. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you should be thanking me, Gabby. I came here to donate some \r\nblood. I mean, isn't this the place? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, why didn't you say so? I'd be happy to help you. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, then. ",
        "",
        "Michael: What have you done now? ",
        "Caleb: You know, having a twin is starting to become a real drag. But I'm not \r\ngoing to let you ruin my good mood with another one of your pious lectures. ",
        "Michael: I don't trust your good moods. ",
        "Caleb: Did I happen to mention who showed up at my little party, bro? Olivia. \r\nLooks like all that praying you're doing ain't doing no good. ",
        "Michael: I can bet she didn't come willingly. ",
        "Caleb: I didn't put a gun to her head. ",
        "Michael: You might as well have. You're manipulating her. ",
        "Caleb: So what? Everybody plays games when they're first falling in love. \r\nEventually, she'll come out of her own free will. ",
        "Michael: Pretty soon Livvie won't even know what free will is. ",
        "Caleb: What do you think about a late-summer wedding? Something simple, \r\ntasteful. ",
        "Michael: You can't do this. ",
        "Caleb: And then, shortly after, Eve's baby will be born. It'll be the perfect \r\nstart to my new family. ",
        "Michael: We are destined to be alone. You know that. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, that's your destiny, bro. We both know I'm no priest. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Livvie, what's wrong? Why do you think Caleb was following you? ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Jack: Livvie. Talk to me, please. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Ok, Jack, that's why I'm here -- because I wanted to tell you \r\nthat -- that I was with him. ",
        "Jack: What? How did he get to you? ",
        "Livvie: Jack, just listen. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, did he hurt you? Did he kidnap you? What went on? ",
        "Livvie: That's what I'm trying to say. Caleb didn't kidnap me. It was my \r\nidea. I went to him willingly. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: No, I didn't mean the hospital recovery room. I meant the Recovery Room \r\nrestaurant across the street. Jeez, Madame Alicia, I thought you were a psychic. \r\nI'm sorry. Don't flip your turban on me. I apologize. Look, please, please, I \r\nneed to see you. It is truly so urgent. You see, you remember that thing we \r\nconnected on, the baby boy? Well, I just found out some of my friends are having \r\na baby boy, and those weird vibes we both got -- I think it means something. \r\nMadame Alicia, I think it means the baby could be in danger. Please. ",
        "",
        "Ian: No, no, see, a boy needs to have a strong name. Liam, I think. ",
        "Eve: Well, what about a good old strong American name, like Aloysius or Billy \r\nBob? ",
        "Ian: Rufus Thornhart. ",
        "Eve: I know -- ",
        "Lucy: Hi, you two little lovebirdies. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Eve: Oh, hi. ",
        "Lucy: You look so happy. ",
        "Ian: Well, we are happy. We just found out we're having a baby boy. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: Wow, that -- amazing. Congratulations. ",
        "Eve: Thanks, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: You know, could I -- could I just ask you, like, a hypothetical -- \r\nhypotenuse -- hypothesis kind of question? ",
        "Ian: Sure. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Say X knew something and wanted to tell Y, you know, and maybe X \r\nwasn't sure if Y needed to really know it or sure about it and maybe X had this \r\nZ person that X could talk to to find out if maybe what Y was needing to know is \r\nreally true or maybe it's just X's huge, big fat misunderstanding. ",
        "Eve: Lucy, what are you saying? ",
        "Lucy: That you're so darn happy about the baby, and that's what's important.\r\n",
        "Ian: No, you wanted to say something about the baby before you went into your \r\nalphabet talk. ",
        "Lucy: Why would anybody say anything about an innocent little child? I was \r\njust asking for your opinion. ",
        "Eve: Well, the thing is, is that we don't even know what the question is, \r\nLucy. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. You know, I am going to go because I see someone I know and I \r\nreally want to say hello. Ta. Oh, Madame Alicia. ",
        "Ian: That was weird. ",
        "Eve: That's Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Hi, listen, it's me, it's Lucy -- you know, you know, the woman who \r\ncalled. Listen, don't look over there. You have arrived in the nick of time \r\nbecause I almost spilled the cosmic beans, I almost ruined somebody's happiness, \r\nand those two people over there really deserve a lot of happiness. No, don't. \r\nDon't look, don't look. ",

        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Alison: There you are. Deneice said she saw you head to the blood bank. ",
        "Gabriela: Alison, you're not supposed to be in here. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Sorry. Why didn't you ever tell me that you were going to give \r\nblood today? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, just a spur-of-the-moment thing, that's all. You know, being a \r\ngood citizen and all. ",

        "Alison: Ok. ",

        "Gabriela: You're right. You're all done. Hold your arm up. ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. Bye. ",
        "Alison: What is up with Gabby? She used to be so nice, and now she's -- and \r\nsince when did nurses start showing cleavage? ",
        "Jamal: Look, let's just go home, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok, wait, will you help me find Livvie? Because I can't find her and \r\nI'm really worried about her. ",

        "Jack: You mean to tell me you went to the catacombs by yourself to see Caleb.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Hey, look, it's hard to explain, but something is happening to me, \r\nJack, that I don't understand. ",

        "Jack: Damn him! ",
        "Livvie: Calm down, please! I love you, ok? But something -- there's something \r\nabout Caleb. I don't know what it is, but it seems to draw me to him. Please \r\ndon't be angry with me. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, look, I'm not angry with you. I just want you to tell me \r\nexactly what happened. ",
        "Livvie: God, Jack, sit down. You're sick again. ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Livvie: You're sick. ",
        "Jack: Look, I'm fine. Listen to me -- all that matters is you. Please tell me \r\nexactly what happened. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Ok, we talked and -- and he tried to convince me that I would be \r\nbetter off with him. God, Jack, you are so pale right now. ",
        "Jack: Then what? Did he touch you in any way? ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, no. I told him I love you. Then I came here because I am \r\nscared of this interest I have in another man. Why am I doing this? ",
        "Jack: Hey, look, you did nothing wrong. Just trust me, Caleb is evil. ",
        "Livvie: How do you mean? ",
        "Jack: I mean that he's dangerous, all right, and I'm done taking any chances \r\nto risk your safety. I'm going to get you out of here tonight. ",

        "Lucy: Do you sense it? I mean, can you feel it? That is Eve and Ian, and you \r\ndo feel their happiness, right? The warmth, the complete happiness over this \r\nbaby. And they're sitting there talking about baby names and cribs and all that \r\nadorable stuff, and -- I don't know, Madame Alicia. What do you feel? Do you \r\nfeel I should drop my bad news on them, go and tell them that I've had these \r\nominous warnings through my tarot cards about their baby or what? ",
        "Madame Alicia: You've got a gift, Lucy. Your powers are strong. You've got to \r\nuse them wisely, and -- listen -- I know you act impulsively, which gets you \r\ninto trouble, right? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy, are you ever right. Yeah, just, you know, sometimes I actually \r\nthink I could write an entire miniseries. ",
        "Madame Alicia: Well, your feeling about your friends is accurate. There's \r\ndefinitely something strange surrounding them. But first, get the pieces \r\ntogether before you act, ok? Only then will you find what you're looking for.\r\n",
        "Lucy: That's it. I think I'm getting what you're trying to send me. I need to \r\ndo a little more yin, a lot less yang. Right. It's just -- oh, boy, Madame \r\nAlicia, patience has never been one of my big virtues. ",

        "Eve: Is she still staring at us? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, she still is. ",
        "Eve: I think I know why. It's because she lost her little girl. ",
        "Ian: Must be hard to hear about other people's babies. ",
        "Eve: I'll tell you, there is nothing worse in this world than losing your \r\nchild. ",
        "Ian: I know, I know. You were pregnant and lost a baby. I know that. But you \r\nwere alone then. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, and I was young and stupid. But not a day goes by that I don't \r\nthink about that little boy and what he would have been like if he had lived.\r\n",
        "Ian: I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: You know what, though? This -- in a way, it makes me so grateful for \r\nwhat I have now. I love this little baby inside of me already, as much as I love \r\nhis daddy. ",
        "Ian: You're going to be a wonderful mother. Everything's going to be fine.\r\n",

        "Caleb: Why can't you just be happy for me, Michael? I'm about to become a \r\nfamily man. ",
        "Michael: What you're describing -- it isn't a family, Caleb. It's a \r\nnightmare. Turning a young woman into a monster like yourself? Stealing a \r\ncouple's newborn? ",
        "Caleb: I never did think the commandments were all they were cracked up to \r\nbe. ",
        "Michael: It's sick, even for you. ",
        "Caleb: More comments like that and you're not sitting at the head table. ",
        "Michael: I was at your last wedding, remember? ",
        "Caleb: That doesn't count. The bride never showed up. ",
        "Michael: Never showed up, Caleb? You killed her. ",
        "Caleb: It was an accident. You know, I lost control. I wasn't patient. But I \r\nam older and I am wiser now. ",
        "Michael: Don't you see? You're just setting yourself up for more pain. Hey, \r\nwe were doing good before you saw this girl. You had found some peace. ",
        "Caleb: I was just waiting, waiting for the right time, the right girl. Don't \r\nyou see, Michael? All I want is what everybody else already has -- a family to \r\ncall my own. ",
        "Michael: We have each other. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, that is so comforting. ",
        "Michael: A normal family life -- it's not for you. ",
        "Caleb: What is, hmm? Extinction? I'm the last, Michael, thanks to you and \r\nyour celibacy thing. It's up to me to keep the bloodline alive. ",
        "Michael: And I think it should die. What happened to you, it's a terrible \r\nthing. But it has to stop. ",
        "Caleb: Can it? I will have this family. I will have Eve's baby as my own. ",

        "Michael: I will not let you talk about Eve this way. I know what you are, \r\nCaleb, and I know how you suffered. But I beg you, stop this before you lose \r\nwhatever trace of humanity you have left. ",
        "Caleb: Too late. And I won't let you turn me into some bloodless saint like \r\nyou, someone who doesn't feel anything, who doesn't desire anything. I'd rather \r\nbe undead. ",
        "Michael: I didn't ask for this war, but I will fight it. ",
