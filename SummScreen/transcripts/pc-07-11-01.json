        "Lucy: Oh, there you are. ",
        "Kevin: Hi. ",
        "Lucy: I was getting so very worried about you. ",
        "Kevin: I'm so sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe the day I had at the \r\noffice. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, poor baby. Did you have a really, really, really, really rough day?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah. The only thing that got me through was knowing you were here \r\nwaiting for me. ",
        "Lucy: Well, here I am. Hey, do you think you could stand a surprise? ",
        "Kevin: Depends on the surprise. ",
        "Lucy: Why don't I show you?",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Come this way. Come on. Come on, come on. Ok. Freeze. All right, \r\nyou ready? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Voila! ",
        "Kevin: This is your surprise? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Not exactly what I expected, but -- what the hell is it? ",
        "Lucy: Pieces -- pieces to a puzzle. ",
        "Kevin: This is a puzzle? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. The mystery -- every strange thing, every weird thing that's been \r\ngoing on in Port Charles. We're going to use this to solve the mystery. ",
        "",
        "Ian: All right. Now, this is either really romantic or really stupid. What \r\nelse? Flowers. Flowers are good. Women love flowers, right? Ok, candles. ",
        "[Ian hums] ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Eve: Hey, Ian. ",
        "Ian: My darling wife. ",
        "Eve: Look who I found. And guess where he's staying. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: What are you doing? Hey, are you all right? ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, watch out. Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Jamal! Stop it! ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Let go of me! ",
        "Jamal: Just wait! ",
        "Livvie: Jack! ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, just -- ",
        "Livvie: Do something, please! ",
        "Jamal: Just wait! ",
        "Livvie: Stop! ",
        "Jamal: Livvie -- ",
        "Alison: What are you doing? Let go. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, my gosh! Jamal, what is your problem? ",
        "Jamal: I thought there was a spider on you or something. ",
        "Livvie: So you threw a blanket over my face? ",
        "Alison: Jamal, she's not on fire. ",
        "Jamal: All right, look, it was a joke, ok? Just a joke. Dang! ",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's a good joke. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, really funny, Jamal. ",
        "Alison: Can I talk to you, please? ",
        "Jamal: Sure. ",
        "Alison: Alone in the bike shop? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Livvie, I'm -- ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know, you're sorry. I'm fine. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Livvie: What is going on? Why are you guys acting so weird? ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey, hey. It was a joke, all right? Just like Jamal said. He \r\nwas trying to ease the tension. Everybody's been so on edge. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I'm not just talking about that. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, Jamal and I are really worried, ok, about this whole Caleb \r\nstuff. ",
        "Livvie: You told him about that, that I went to him? Come on. ",
        "Jack: I told him that Caleb has a weird hold on you and that's why I want to \r\nget you out of here for a while. ",
        "Livvie: Are you sure that's such a good idea, going away? ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I've never been so sure about anything in my entire life. All \r\nright? Caleb's danger is real. You do believe that, right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Yeah, I believe it. ",
        "Jack: Ok, good. All right, let's get out of here, ok? ",
        "Livvie: Jack, where are we going? ",
        "Jack: I figured it all out. I heard about this place. It's a remote, secluded \r\nplace no one knows about, but it's really nice. It's kind of like a retreat \r\nwhere you will be safe. We both will. ",
        "Livvie: Both? ",
        "Jack: Livvie, trust me, ok? I'm going to take care of you. I will no matter \r\nwhat. ",
        "Livvie: Of course I trust you. ",
        "Jack: Good. ",
        "Livvie: Of course. ",
        "Livvie: Let's go. Hey, is that all you're going to take? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. That's all I need. Let's get out of here. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: What is this collage supposed to solve exactly? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait a minute. Before we go any further, I'm going to explain this \r\nto you. I want you to try and go with me here. At least try, ok? Don't be so the \r\ndoubt-sayer, ok? Can you do that? ",
        "Kevin: Ok, I'll try. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, you try. Ok, so we'll begin. Now, we both agree that there are some \r\nvery strange things that have been going on around town, and we both agree that \r\nnothing happens without a reason. I mean, there isn't really a coincidence in \r\nthe universe. There isn't really -- ",
        "Kevin: Well, I never said that there -- ",
        "Lucy: No, regardless. The point is is this -- this is a puzzle. These are the \r\npieces we're going to fit together just as Madame Alicia advised me because she \r\nsaid if I fit logically the pieces -- ",
        "Kevin: Go back. Madame Alicia? ",
        "Lucy: The psychic. I told you I was going to see her. Oh, Doc, guess what. \r\nGuess what. She really truly believes that I have a gift just like she has and \r\nthat maybe I could use my gift to help people, so that's what I want to do. ",
        "Kevin: Great. What are you talking about? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I'm talking about -- ok, the pieces of the puzzle, right? I'm \r\nbeginning, I think, to fit them all together. We have the Stranger card, right?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh. ",
        "Lucy: And the Baby Boy card. ",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh. ",
        "Lucy: And the fact that I keep somehow running into Eve and to Ian. ",
        "Kevin: At the hospital where they both work. ",
        "Lucy: Scoff if you want, you naysayer. The fact is, Doc, I really deeply \r\nbelieve that the Baby Boy card, well, it's Eve's and Ian's baby boy. ",
        "Kevin: But if it is, what does it have to do with the stranger? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I think the stranger means to harm that child. ",
        "",
        "Michael: So I've pretty much finished up all my work at the monastery. ",
        "Ian: What about your brother? ",
        "Michael: Well, he's pretty much a work in progress. So Eve was kind enough to \r\noffer me your home until I figure out what's next. ",
        "Ian: Well, she's a very kind person. Full of surprises. ",
        "Michael: However, Ian, if it's going to be any problem at all -- ",
        "Ian: No, no, no problem at all. As long as your brother doesn't come to \r\nvisit, you can stay as long as you like. ",
        "Eve: Ok, let me get you settled. I'll show you where your room is. ",
        "Michael: Please, Eve, if you'd just point me in the right direction. ",
        "Eve: It's right back here. But hurry up because dinner is ready. ",
        "Michael: I already ate. You two enjoy your dinner. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Oh, how romantic. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: A heart. ",
        "Ian: That's kind of nice, right? ",
        "Eve: Oh, you're the best. ",
        "Ian: Actually, I had a whole romantic evening planned, but bringing a priest \r\nin the house kind of puts a damper on the evening. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Yeah, you know, I should have called you. ",
        "Ian: No, that's ok. ",
        "Eve: No, it's not. I should have talked to you about this first. But, Ian, he \r\njust looked so sad and so lonely. You know? Like he need a couple friends. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Did he say anything about his brother? ",
        "Eve: No. And I didn't want to pry. ",
        "Ian: I see. ",
        "Eve: Well, Ian, I'm sure that if Michael is here, he's taken care of it. Ok? \r\nLet's eat. I'm starving. ",
        "Ian: There's a shocker. ",
        "",
        "Michael: It's over, Caleb. With this, Eve and her baby are safe from you.",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, why would you think that Eve and Ian's baby could be in danger?\r\n",
        "Lucy: The same way I know the stranger is evil. ",
        "Kevin: Your intuition. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, Doc, that same intuition that has proven right many times, if you \r\nrecall, especially -- especially when it comes to children. ",
        "Kevin: I still think that you're jumping to conclusions, Lucy. I mean, just \r\nbecause you drew the Baby Boy card and Eve is having a boy -- I mean, let's face \r\nit, there was a 50% chance that she'd have a girl. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I really, really believe there's a lot more to it than that. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, Lucy, I don't see it. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, then let me show it to you. That's exactly why I created these \r\npuzzle pieces, ok? Let's just start with the strange occurrences in town, ok? \r\nFor example, let's start with Victor's friend Abe, right? ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. He was, what, a healthy, average, happy, normal kind of guy, right?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Right. ",
        "Lucy: And how is Abe now? ",
        "Kevin: Catatonic. ",
        "Lucy: Catatonic. Doc, exactly. I said that. \"Catatonic.\" The exact same word. \r\nDon't you see? You're getting it now. Ok, ok, listen to me. When did he become \r\nthat way? After he saw something absolutely terrifying in the woods, right? So \r\nterrifying that before he became catatonic, something came over him and he \r\nbecame ferociously violent. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, thank you, Raymond Burr. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you're welcome, Della Street. Please, bear with me here, Doc, \r\ncome on. Jack. Jack goes to the exact same woods, and something very strange \r\nhappens to him also, right? So strange that he mysteriously disappears for a few \r\ndays and even more mysteriously, reappears without an explanation, some weird \r\nexplanation, cockamamie story we got from the kids. ",
        "Kevin: Which I still don't buy. ",
        "Lucy: Neither do I. ",
        "Kevin: Go ahead. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, those same woods, right? Same woods. Serena -- we're on a \r\npicnic together in those same woods. I get the strangest feeling that \r\nsomething's just not right, and the Stranger card appears. ",
        "Kevin: The same woods where you ran into Ian. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, yes. Exactly. I ran into Ian. The Stranger card, right? This \r\nbrings us to the Baby Boy card. I'm watching television, Madame Alicia is on, she \r\nsays that somewhere out there in TV land, someone is connecting with her, honing \r\nin on a baby boy. ",
        "Kevin: You. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, Doc. And don't you see? And then I go to the lighthouse. I go to \r\nsee you. I'm there. There's a knock on the door. I open the door, and who is \r\nstanding there but the stranger?",
        "Kevin: The same stranger who gave you such a weird vibe. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. The weirdest vibes I think I've ever had in my whole entire life. \r\nNow, Doc, somebody without my intuitional gifts probably couldn't see it. But, \r\nDoc, even you -- you can see that every single thing on this board -- look at \r\nthem. They are all connected, right? Somehow. ",
        "Kevin: \"Intuitional\" isn't a word, but -- ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: You're right. ",
        "Lucy: I'm what? ",
        "Kevin: You're right. I agree. Something is going on, but what I didn't see \r\nbefore until it was looking me right in the face is that Livvie, my daughter, is \r\nright in the middle of it. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Are you sure you're all right to ride? I mean, after what happened to \r\nyou in the race. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, I'm fine. ",
        "Livvie: Well, Jack, I'm not so sure about that. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I just want to get out of here. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but taking me away is totally disrupting your life. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, you are my life. And all I care about is keeping you safe. Ok?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Jack: Ok. Let's get out of here. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I told you it was a joke. Ok, if I'd have known that Livvie was going \r\nto freak like that, I wouldn't have done it. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, of course she's going to freak out. That was a freaky thing to \r\ndo. And plus, everything else that she's dealing with? Come on. ",
        "Jamal: All right, you're right. You're right. Ok, I wasn't thinking. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I guess it's kind of gotten to everybody. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Well, the good news is I think it's all under control now. ",
        "Alison: Because Jack and Livvie are leaving? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah, just long enough until that stalker guy just forgets about \r\nLivvie and moves on. ",
        "Alison: I'm going to miss them. ",
        "Jamal: Well, me, too, but actually, I think it's going to be good for them. \r\nYou know, with everything that's happened, you know, they can spend some time \r\nalone. And they're not the only ones. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I've heard that before. ",
        "Jamal: What, you don't think I mean it? ",
        "Alison: Well, you said we were going to close the bike shop so we could spend \r\nsome time together, but you've seen more of Jack than you have of me. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you know what? That is about to change, lady. ",
        "Alison: You know what we need? ",
        "Jamal: Hmm? ",
        "Alison: We need a nice, quiet evening at home. Ok? I could make a nice \r\ndinner. You can go rent some movies. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: We can cuddle on the couch. ",
        "Jamal: But we never seem to get to -- ahem. ",
        "Alison: Ahem. Yeah, that would be perfect. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Alison: I'm going to go. ",
        "Jamal: Where are you going? ",
        "Alison: I'm going to go check the apartment and see what we need for dinner. \r\nI know just what I'm going to make you. ",
        "Jamal: All right. So it's a date? Friday night, then. ",
        "Alison: You swear that this is going to happen? I mean, do you? Like, \r\nnothing's going to come up at the last minute? ",
        "Jamal: Of course. I said it was a date. ",
        "Alison: Ok. A date, then. Bye. ",
        "Jamal: Bye. ",
        "Jamal: Let's see. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Holy places -- garlic, \r\ngarlic. Maybe a cross and garlic. Let's see. Now, here it is again -- amulets. \r\nCharms that keep vampires away. That's what I need. ",

        "Eve: Oh, Michael, you didn't have to do this. ",
        "Michael: I wanted to. You're very special to me. ",
        "Eve: I feel the same way. You're a good friend, Michael. It's beautiful. \r\nIsn't it beautiful, Ian? ",
        "Ian: It's very nice. Here you go. ",
        "Michael: I hope you don't mind. ",
        "Eve: Oh, thanks. ",
        "Michael: It's just a little token of my thanks for all of Eve's kindness. ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. What is it? ",
        "Eve: It's his family crest. ",

        "Jamal: No. No, it's just dumb stuff. ",

        "Alison: Oh, come on -- Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise. ",
        "Jamal: Are you crazy? Please. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe I should just take a little bite of your neck and show \r\nyou. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, stop playing. That's not funny. ",
        "Alison: My God, Jamal, I'm just kidding. Talk about not being able to take a \r\njoke. ",

        "Ian: Yeah, sure, sure. And I'm concerned for my family, that's all. Forgive \r\nme, Father. ",
        "Michael: It's understandable. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll give you some \r\ntime. It's time for my evening prayers. ",

        "Ian: How long is he staying? ",
        "Eve: Ian, Michael took me in, gave me a place to stay when I really needed \r\nsomebody. I think the least we can do is return the favor by opening our home to \r\nhim. ",
