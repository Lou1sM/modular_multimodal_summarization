        "Eve: Amazing. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? How about the loving husband who got up at the crack of dawn to \r\nget you the stuff? ",
        "Eve: Mmm, just as amazing as these eclairs. And I plan on showing him just \r\nhow appreciative I am as soon as I polish off this box. ",
        "Ian: Oh. How appreciative is appreciative? ",
        "Eve: I knew there was an ulterior motive. ",

        "Jill: Lucy, I've been trying to reach you. The board meeting has been pushed \r\nback. ",
        "Lucy: Oh -- that's a good thing. Hey, we can have breakfast together. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Jill: Uh, no, you can't because there's an officer waiting in the on-call \r\nroom. He said to send you in as soon as possible. ",
        "Lucy: A police officer? ",
        "Jill: There's been another murder. ",
        "Kevin: I guess I'd better get in right now. Thank you, Jill. ",

        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to go with you. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, come on, Doc. Partners, right? And I promise, hmm, mum's the word. \r\nI won't say anything. I'll be quiet. I'll be good. ",
        "Kevin: Quiet? ",
        "Lucy: Silent partner. ",

        "Kevin: Andy? ",
        "Andy Capelli: Hey, Doc. I'm glad you're here. This is Joyce Jennings. ",
        "Joyce: J.J., ok? J.J. And I already told him everything I know. I just met \r\nGarth. We were getting, you know, kind of friendly. Next thing I know, Garth \r\ntakes off with the queen of dirty dancing, out the door with that slut. And then \r\nI heard he was -- oh, God. ",
        "Andy: Look, I'm sorry, J.J. ",
        "J.J.: Look, I just want to throw some water on my face. You got a place? ",
        "Frank: I'll show you. ",
        "J.J.: Ok. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Anybody want to catch me up? ",
        "Andy: Our friend J.J. was with the last of the three broken necks found in \r\nthe past few days. ",
        "Emilio: Frank and I found the first, bottom of the ravine. ",
        "Andy: Zach Vernon, and then some vagrant John Doe in a warehouse alley. ",
        "Kevin: No marks on the bodies? ",
        "Andy: All three bled out, Doc, and there was no blood at the scene. ",
        "Frank: And they all three had that look on their face. ",
        "Lucy: What? What look? ",
        "Frank: Like they'd all peeked into the mouth of hell before they checked out.\r\n",
        "Andy: The department can't help thinking that there might be some kind of \r\nwacko serial killer prowling around. ",
        "Frank: Hey, heads up, guys. ",
        "Kevin: J.J., you feel better? ",
        "J.J.: You know, I'd just like to go home. You can call with any more questions. \r\nI'll be there. ",
        "Andy: Fine, J.J. I'll give you a ride. Dr. Collins? ",
        "Kevin: I'll be in my office. ",
        "Andy: Thanks. After you, J.J. ",
        "J.J.: That's the slut. ",
        "Kevin: That's a nurse here at the hospital. ",
        "J.J.: Well, you don't understand. She was with him. She's the woman who took \r\noff with Garth. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Sam. I was wondering where you were. You never showed up at the \r\nRecovery Room. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, that's because your brother tried to kill me. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, right. ",
        "Sam: I'm serious. The guy's not human. He's not human at all. ",

        "Jack: Jeez. Even a hardwood bench would be better than down here. What the --\r\n",
        "Caleb: Of all the churches in all the world, you happen to stumble into mine. \r\nWell, now that you're here, what are we going to do for fun? Too bad, Jack. So \r\nit's just us. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian, Michael has been nothing but sweet and loving ever since -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah, a little too much of both, as far as I'm concerned. ",
        "Eve: Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. After everything we have been \r\nthrough together, you're not honestly saying that you think I have a thing for \r\nMichael. ",
        "Ian: I'm not saying that. ",
        "Eve: Well, then, why are we having this discussion? ",
        "Ian: What I'm saying is I don't like the way he looks at you. ",
        "Eve: Ian, he's a priest. ",
        "Ian: He's a man, Eve. He's a man. ",

        "Andy: So you did leave with him? ",
        "Kevin: Andy -- ",
        "Gabriela: Did I meet a guy named Garth at a bar? Sure. But I didn't know he \r\nwas dead until you told me. ",
        "J.J.: Please, her hands were all over him. ",
        "Emilio: Hey, wait a minute. ",
        "J.J.: Bumping and grinding like a 20-year pro. ",
        "Emilio: Hey, watch it. That's my sister! ",
        "Frank: All right, calm down, calm down. ",
        "Emilio: Hey, hey, nobody talks about my family -- ",

        "Frank: Emilio, come on. ",
        "Andy: All right, we heard your version. It's her turn now. ",
        "Gabriela: I did meet Mr. Garth at the Artery bar. We did have a drink. He \r\ncame on to me. He didn't get what he wanted. He was a little miffed by that, so \r\nI got up and left. ",
        "J.J.: Liar. ",
        "Gabriela: Look, officer, is there anything else? Because as far as I know, \r\nit's not a crime to meet a guy in a bar. ",
        "Andy: Yeah, you can go, for now. ",
        "Gabriela: Thanks. Bye, all. ",
        "Andy: So, J.J., you were saying that -- ",
        "[phone rings] ",
        "Andy: I'm going to need privacy for this. Don't you move. I'll be back down \r\nhere. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, don't worry. We'll be here. ",
        "J.J.: You got to believe me, it was her -- that nurse. I'm sure she had \r\nsomething to do with Garth ending up dead. ",
        "Kevin: But what makes you so sure? ",
        "J.J.: Because I saw him. Yeah, Garth and I turned up the volume, but I cool off \r\nfast, so I came back. But Garth was still wound up tight, acting really weird, \r\ntalking to some spooky guy. ",
        "Kevin: Hold it. Are you saying that you saw him talking to someone else \r\nbefore Garth disappeared? ",
        "J.J.: Yeah, I guess so, some guy at the bar. What about him? ",
        "Kevin: Can you tell me what he looks like? ",
        "J.J.: Yeah -- like he thought he owned the place. Dark brown hair, handsome, \r\neyes like -- oh, I don't know. Never seen eyes like that before. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Wait -- don't tell me, Jack. You got garlic around your neck? Oh, come \r\non. ",
        "Jack: But how? ",
        "Caleb: Stories. I love linguine carbonara, extra garlic, a little sprig of \r\nwolfsbane on top -- mmm. Wash it down with a big mug of holy water. Oh, I'll \r\nadmit, I_-- I burn real easy in the sunlight. But all that stuff about \r\nshriveling to dust if we're out after sunrise? That's all Santa Claus and the \r\nEaster bunny, Jack. All those things you thought you'd memorized from the \r\nlate-night movies? Wrong, Jack -- dead wrong. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, one rule works. I saw it myself. You can't lay one fang on \r\nme in the presence of love, in front of Livvie. That's why you killed me the \r\nlast time you saw me. ",
        "Caleb: True. I do love Olivia. And you're right, Jack. I can't kill in the \r\npresence of love. But then again, I don't think Olivia's here now, is she?",

        "Eve: I refuse to believe that you are jealous of a priest. ",
        "Ian: I'm not jealous of a priest. I am uncomfortable. ",
        "Eve: About what? ",
        "Ian: About a priest having feelings for my wife, feelings that he may or may \r\nnot be aware of. ",
        "Eve: Ok, but, fine. So you want me to walk in there and tell him \"I am so \r\nsorry, but my husband thinks you've got the hots for me, so you have to go?\" ",
        "Ian: I told you, I don't even think he's aware of it. ",
        "Eve: Listen, Ian, whatever your suspicions are, they're wrong. So, please -- \r\nplease just let this go. Ok? ",
        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Eve: Thank you. ",
        "Ian: For now anyway. ",

        "Chris: Here's $500. That should get you out of town. If my brother's as \r\ndangerous as you say he is, I suggest you stay out. ",
        "Sam: Oh, he is, big time. ",
        "Jill: Excuse me, Dr. Ramsey. We have a problem -- the blood bank. ",
        "",
        "Frank: I don't get it. So what if some bulldog biker chick runs her mouth off \r\nabout your sister. ",
        "Emilio: You're right. It's not what that witch said about Gabby. It's Gabby. \r\nSomething's going on and she won't talk. ",
        "Frank: Joe is worried, too. ",
        "Emilio: What? ",
        "Frank: Well, before he left, he asked me to keep an eye on Gabby, something \r\nabout her falling for some guy in record time. ",
        "Emilio: Yeah -- head over heels. She won't even bring him to the house, tell \r\nus his name. She's throwing up all kinds of walls and driving my mom nuts. She's \r\nchanged overnight, Frank. My sister's a stranger. It's like I don't even know \r\nwho she is anymore. ",

        "Chris: Well, they just handed me the inventory. We're short. ",
        "Gabriela: What? That's impossible. ",
        "Chris: Apparently not. Now, I put you in charge down there. Now there's blood \r\nmissing. ",

        "Lucy: Yeah, and the bridge of his nose -- it's thinner, thinner. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, all right. You mean more like that? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, and his lips are fuller. ",

        "J.J.: Oh, yeah. Oh, scary dude. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, she's absolutely right. She's right. That's him. I will never, \r\never forget his face. ",
        "Kevin: Hold on. Lucy, what is going on? How do you know what this man looks \r\nlike? ",
        "Lucy: Because I saw him. ",
