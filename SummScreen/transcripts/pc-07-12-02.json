        "Ricky: I can't believe it -- the commissioner of the police shaking my hand. \r\nYou know, I could really get used to this whole hero thing. Hey, is the food all \r\nright? You're not eating. ",
        "Karen: Huh? ",
        "Ricky: You're not still shook up, are you? Karen? ",
        "Karen: What? Ricky, you know what? I'm sorry I made you miss your gig. ",
        "Ricky: What, are you kidding me? The guys in the band are totally loving this \r\npublicity. We might even get a gig in New York out of it. Besides, what's \r\nimportant is that you're ok, right? ",
        "Jamal: Ah -- there he is -- the hero. ",
        "Ricky: Jamal, Jamal -- kiss the ring. ",
        "Jamal: What's going on? Yeah. So, I heard about everything that went down \r\nover there. Sure you're ok? ",
        "Karen: Yeah, thanks. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, have a beer on me, all right? I'll be right back. ",
        "Jamal: Wow. ",
        "Ricky: Sit down. ",
        "Jamal: A changed man. ",
        "Ricky: Don't touch my food. ",
        "Jamal: So, I'm glad everything turned out the way it did. ",
        "Karen: Yeah. Me, too. ",
        "Jamal: All sorts of crazy stuff happening in that park. ",
        "Karen: That shadow thing? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, crazy dude. Same story -- black hood, no one sees his \r\nface. Some people say there isn't a face. ",
        "Karen: There wasn't. ",
        "Jamal: Just swoops in and out, saving anybody in trouble, like he's some kind \r\nof comic book hero or something. Just -- wait. What'd you say? Are you saying \r\nyou saw him? ",
        "Karen: No face, out of nowhere. One minute he's there. He attacked the guy \r\nthat grabbed my bag. That shadow thing is what saved me. ",
        "Ricky: What? ",
        "Karen: Ricky. ",
        "Ricky: The shadow thing saved you? You mind telling me why I didn't know \r\nabout this? ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Jack, come on. This isn't funny. ",
        "Alison: It's -- the door is probably locked. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I know it is. I told you -- wait a minute. What's going on? You \r\ndon't seem that upset. ",
        "Alison: Who said that I was? ",
        "Rafe: Jack did. Said you were practically losing it, that you might even hurt \r\nyourself, and that was all a lie, wasn't it? That's great. That's nice. Come on, \r\nJack! ",
        "Alison: I think he's gone. ",
        "Rafe: You know, I've heard all these things about you -- that you're supposed \r\nto be this nice girl -- so this is really beneath you. ",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? ",
        "Rafe: The tricks, the lies, all that, you know. ",
        "Alison: Oh, right. Yeah, that's me. ",
        "Rafe: Jack! ",
        "Alison: I'm deceiving you and cheating you and setting you up. That's me. ",
        "Rafe: What am I supposed to think, huh? ",
        "Alison: Why don't you try thinking at all? ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: You heard what I said. False pretenses, feelings that would actually \r\nmake you do things you wouldn't normally do -- does any of that sound familiar \r\nto you? ",
        "Rafe: What is it? What kind of games are you playing here? ",
        "Alison: I am not playing games. I don't do that. You must have me confused \r\nwith your wife. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: So what do you say to this, Alison, huh? Nothing's stronger than \r\nfamily, and nothing -- nothing means more to Rafe. Right, Mom? Mommy. God. Well, \r\nI never thought it'd happen so soon. I'm not ready. But I will be, I will be. \r\nThe time's right, the guy's right. Once I get pregnant, he'll be mine for good \r\n-- father and husband -- and there won't be a thing she can do. Mine forever. \r\nWow. Come on, Rafe. You've been gone for -- God, I don't know how long. My clock \r\nis ticking, and I have to get pregnant. It has to be tonight, Livvie, ok? It has \r\nto be. Ok. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yes. And it will be. ",

        "Ricky: So this hero thing was all a bunch of crap. ",
        "Karen: Ricky, listen -- ",
        "Ricky: The commendations, the slap on the back -- all of it. What a chump I \r\nwas to believe that I saved the day. ",
        "Karen: But you did. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, right. I came in and cleaned up after the shadow thing took off.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Does it really matter who did what? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, yeah, it does, all right? ",
        "Jamal: Come on. ",
        "Ricky: So, Karen, why don't you tell us what really happened, huh? ",
        "Karen: He was there, ok, before you showed up. It just all happened so fast. \r\nThat guy grabbed my medical bag. And then all of a sudden, it -- that shadow \r\ncame out of nowhere, and then it was all over. ",
        "Jamal: Just like that? ",
        "Karen: I don't know what he did or how he did it or what happened. The next \r\nthing I know, the guy's 20 feet away, and it just stood there. That shadow -- no \r\nface, no eyes, just black. And it just stood there, waiting, until you showed \r\nup. ",
        "Jamal: And then it just disappeared? ",
        "Ricky: And that's when I ran in and saved the day. ",
        "Karen: Stop it. ",
        "Ricky: What were you thinking, Karen, huh? What were you thinking? Were you \r\nthinking that I needed the crowd to slap me on the back or what? ",
        "Karen: Yes. ",
        "Ricky: What? ",
        "Karen: Yes, I did. That's exactly what I thought. ",

        "Livvie: Hey, baby. Welcome back. You missed me? Because I sure missed -- no \r\n-- God, Livvie, no. That's too obvious. He's not going to buy that. All right, \r\nhow about this one? Mmm. Hi, Rafe, honey. I must have fallen asleep, so why \r\ndon't you come over and warm me up? Because I've been waiting -- and waiting and \r\nwaiting and -- Alison. Oh, God. It has to be her. Livvie, how could you be so \r\ndumb? Damn her! What is it going to take? Rafe isn't yours, Alison. He's not a \r\npart of your life. He's my husband. Calm down, Livvie. Calm down. Ok. Just \r\nthink. Think, think. If you were her -- which you're not -- but if you were, if \r\nyou wanted to take him away and drag him down memory lane until he was \r\nbrainwashed into your arms, where would you take him? Think. Think, think. God, \r\nyes. Yes. Of course. That's it. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Let's just leave Livvie out of this. ",
        "Alison: Oh, believe me, I would love to. But since she's so good at leading \r\nyou around by the nose, I can't. ",
        "Rafe: Leading who by the what? ",
        "Alison: The nose. I chose it because it was polite. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. Good. Ok. So -- what is this place, anyway? ",
        "Alison: This is my grandmother's attic. I brought you here once to talk to \r\nyou, and -- ",
        "Rafe: You did -- no. I've never been here before. I -- I have no memory of \r\nwhatever it is I'm feeling right now. ",
        "Alison: But you do feel something, right? Something. ",
        "Rafe: What's going on here? Why am I here? Why did you bring me here? ",
        "Alison: I wanted to talk to you. The whole locking you in part -- that was \r\nJack's idea. I'm just as surprised about that as you are. And for the record, \r\nI'm not planning on killing myself over you or anybody else, but I really do \r\nbelieve that you are being played for a fool. ",
        "Rafe: Livvie's my wife. ",
        "Alison: I know she's your wife. Great. I know that. But she's also feeding \r\nyou with a bunch of lies, and I think deep down inside you really know it's \r\ntrue, just the same way you know you didn't just wander into my hospital room \r\nand kiss me awake. ",
        "Rafe: No, Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Now all of a sudden there's Livvie. She's conveniently pregnant at \r\nthe same time. And common sense -- it flies right out the window? ",
        "Rafe: Ok, look -- ",
        "Alison: I am looking. ",
        "Rafe: Look -- ",
        "Alison: I am, I am. That's the difference between you and me. What I see is I \r\nsee things with my eyes open. You should maybe try that because the view from \r\nhere is amazing. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. Ok, fine. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, so help me out. ",
        "Alison: Fine. For whatever it's worth, this is what I think. Livvie -- she's \r\nnot pregnant. But she is very desperate and she's willing to say and do anything \r\nto make sure that you don't leave her. And just the same how you know how to put \r\nyour pants on every day, you should be able to look past -- ",
        "Rafe: What does that -- ",
        "Alison: What you don't know and you can't see and pay attention to what you \r\ndo feel because -- ",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right -- would you slow down for a minute? ",
        "Alison: We both know that you feel it! ",
        "Rafe: If you slowed down for a minute, I'd talk -- ",
        "Alison: Yet you won't let yourself -- ",
        "Rafe: Just let me talk to you -- ",
        "Alison: And you're just making yourself so mad because you won't pay \r\nattention -- ",
        "Rafe: Ok, that is it. ",
        "Alison: When are you going to stop being such a doofus, huh? ",
        "Rafe: If you do that -- doofus? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, doofus. That's what I called you. ",

        "Ricky: You really thought that I needed to feel like a hero? ",
        "Karen: Can you please let me explain? ",
        "Ricky: Well, guess what, Karen -- it didn't work. I mean, I must've looked \r\nlike the biggest idiot, making it like I was some big-time superhero. More like \r\nbig-time supermouth. \"Jamal, kiss the ring.\" ",
        "Jamal: Hey, don't sweat it, all right? ",
        "Ricky: Hey, why don't you let the big hero get you another beer, huh? ",
        "Karen: Ok, cut it out. ",
        "Ricky: Thanks a lot for letting me in on the truth about what happened at the \r\npark. ",
        "Jamal: Dude, I was just talking -- ",
        "Ricky: No, no, no, no, no. You know what? As always, good old Ricky was just \r\na little late on the scene. ",
        "Karen: Ok, maybe you didn't stop that creep from grabbing my bag, but you did \r\nstop that black shrouded creature. ",
        "Ricky: Stopped him? Karen, I didn't even see him. ",
        "Karen: Well, the minute you showed up, he split. I mean, there's no telling \r\nwhat he would've done if you weren't looking for me. ",
        "Ricky: I don't know. Maybe he would've flown you home and made you a nice \r\ngourmet meal complete with a $200 bottle of champagne -- ",
        "Jamal: Come on -- ",
        "Ricky: And then he -- ",

        "Jamal: Would you just stop? Sometimes it's hard to stop you, Ricky, like \r\nright now. ",
        "Ricky: Right, Jamal. Then what would you have done, huh? Come on, tell me.\r\n",
        "Karen: Well, maybe he would've let his lady friend here explain instead of \r\nacting like some little spoiled brat who goes around beating everyone up because \r\nsomebody stole his lollipop. ",

Come to our special place.\" Guess what, Alison -- it's our special \r\nplace. I married him -- ugh! Ok. All right. You probably put that there, too, \r\nhuh?

        "Rafe: It's selfish? Why? ",
        "Alison: Because I knew that you couldn't stay and I knew what we had -- it \r\nwouldn't last because of it. But I wanted something to stay while you were gone. \r\nI'm actually a little embarrassed about it now that I think about it. ",
        "Rafe: Well, why? What -- ",
        "Alison: Because I just wanted a reminder of you and what we felt for each \r\nother. I wanted to know that it was really real. But really what mattered was \r\nhow much we felt for each other, which was a lot. And I knew that in my lifetime \r\nI would never love anyone half as much as I loved you. ",

        "Karen: I saw you, Ricky. I saw how excited you were, how you felt when the \r\nnurses, our friends, the police, everyone we met on the street made you feel \r\nlike a hero. I knew from the way you reacted that was probably the first time \r\nsomething like this has ever happened for you. So forgive me, but I didn't want \r\nto take that away.
