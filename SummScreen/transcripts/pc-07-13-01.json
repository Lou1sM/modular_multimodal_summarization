        "Alison: Boo! ",
        "Jamal: Ali, that's -- ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. What, are you reading about vampires again? Well, here. \r\nTake this. It'll keep them away. Sorry. ",
        "Jamal: But, see, you're wrong. There's no proof that this stuff even works.\r\n",
        "Alison: Jamal, there's no real proof because there's no real vampires, all \r\nright? The only thing that's real is that we need to get the bike shop open so \r\nthat we can pay for the rent for this place and for these groceries, which are a \r\nlittle bit too -- ",
        "Jamal: What you got there? ",
        "Alison: Don't -- don't -- there's lots of treats and surprises in there for \r\nour big night. ",
        "Jamal: Big night? What big night? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, like you're not as totally excited about it as I am. ",
        "Jamal: You mean is there anything that I'm looking forward to more than a \r\ntotally uninterrupted evening with you? Oh, let me think about that -- hmm. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Jamal: Totally uninterrupted. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, there goes \"totally.\" Coming. ",
        "Jamal: You know, you don't have to answer. ",
        "Alison: I do if I don't want you preoccupied for the rest of the night \r\nwondering who that was. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Jamal: All right, now. ",
        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Jack: Alison. ",
        "Alison: What are you guys knocking for? Come in. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. What are you doing here, man? I thought you guys were taking off \r\nfor a while. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, we were, but come to find out everything we need's back \r\nhere. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: All right, tell me exactly what this stranger said -- I mean, exactly, \r\nword for word. First you opened the door. ",
        "Lucy: Right, I opened the door, and he said he was lost. He said he wanted to \r\ncome in and get directions. ",
        "Kevin: You don't need to come into someone's house and get directions, right?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, right. ",
        "Kevin: Unless you want something that's inside the house. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I never thought of it that way. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I guess we're going to have to start. So, you had an instinct. \r\nYou kept him out deliberately. ",
        "Lucy: Right, because the guy gave me the creeps, really major creeps. ",
        "Kevin: Because there was something inside the house that he wanted. ",
        "Lucy: Now that you mention it, yes. Yes, but what could it be that he wants?\r\n",
        "Kevin: That's what we have to figure out. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, my friend, we know what you look like. Just what are you looking \r\nfor? ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Where are you? I need you. ",
        "Caleb: Gabriela. ",
        "Gabriela: Caleb. Finally. I knew you'd come. ",
        "Caleb: Jack Ramsey's growing stronger. Someone is helping him to feed. Tell \r\nme it wasn't you, Gabriela. Swear you would never betray me. Convince me. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Something is wrong, Ali. I just know it. And Jack won't tell me what \r\nit is. He won't even tell me what's happening, and on top of that, there's \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Alison: Did you see him again? ",
        "Livvie: No. But I felt him nearby, watching. And I had this dream. Caleb was \r\nthere but I couldn't see him, and so was Jack. All I heard was my name being \r\ncalled, and I didn't know which one to go to and -- God. Alison, I'm not making \r\nany sense, am I? ",
        "Alison: No, no. It's ok because nothing is making sense anymore. I mean, \r\nJamal is acting just as crazy as Jack is. He won't open up the bike shop for \r\nwhatever reason. And now Caleb is stalking you. I just want everything to be \r\nback to the way things were before -- ",
        "Livvie: Before we buried Jack and he dug his way out and -- ",
        "Alison: Before when all that mattered was how much you guys loved each other. \r\nYou do still love him, don't you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, with all my heart. I mean, the day I thought we'd lost him, I \r\nfelt like I would never be able to breathe again. ",
        "Alison: Well, then hold on to that feeling, Livvie. If you follow your heart, \r\nyou won't lose your way. ",
        "Livvie: You really think that's all it's going to take? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, with all of my heart. ",
        "",
        "Jack: My love for Livvie is what gave me the strength to stand up to Caleb.\r\n",
        "Jamal: You left here to try to take Livvie someplace that Caleb couldn't get \r\nto. What happened to that? ",
        "Jack: Oh, that was the plan. Turns out that church in the woods is our \r\nfavorite guy's place to hang. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: You mean to tell me we're mixed up with a vampire that lives in a \r\nmonastery? Oh, man, if I wasn't freaked out before, I am freaking -- what's \r\nwrong? Are you getting a fever? Are you hungry or something? ",
        "Jack: Jamal, the more blood I drink, the more I need. I already went through \r\nall that blood you got for me. I can't keep doing this. ",
        "Jamal: Don't worry about it, ok? I'll just sneak back into the hospital and \r\nget you some more. Ok? But just chill. For now, I want to how you walked away \r\nsmiling. So, what, you came face to face with fang man, and then what? ",
        "Jack: I did what you said. I thought of Livvie -- how much I love her, how \r\nmuch I'm going to protect her -- and it worked. ",
        "Jamal: It made you stronger, right? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. I matched him move for move. ",
        "Jamal: And then you stopped him from killing you, obviously, right? ",
        "Jack: Well, I held him off for a while until Livvie came in, and it was like \r\nhe folded just like that. But I held him off. I stood up to him, and I think it \r\nreally freaked him out. ",
        "Jamal: Yes! Yes! ",
        "Jack: Jamal, you were right. I don't have to turn into some bloodsucking worm \r\nin order to be like him. And I can keep getting stronger. And if I keep doing \r\nall that, I can keep Livvie safe. From Caleb and from me. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: This is your last chance, Gabriela. ",
        "Gabriela: It wasn't me. I don't know how he learned to feed. ",
        "Caleb: Liar. ",
        "Gabriela: No, I would never betray you. ",
        "Caleb: Liar! ",
        "Gabriela: I love you! I would never help Jack. I don't know how he learned to \r\nfeed. I only do what you tell me. Only. Only. I wanted to tell you that so much \r\nat the hospital, but you walked away. ",
        "Caleb: When? ",
        "Gabriela: At G.H., in the hallway. We talked. Remember, you were wearing that \r\npriest collar. ",
        "Caleb: Idiot! That wasn't me. What, you think I'd be caught dead in broad \r\ndaylight wearing a stupid priest collar? It's my freak brother. ",
        "Gabriela: Your -- ",
        "Caleb: We're twins. I just -- I wish I could drain every drop of his blood \r\nright now, just get rid of him once and for all. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, why can't you? ",
        "Caleb: You can't feed on your own blood, your own relatives. Which brings us \r\nback to our original problem -- how that little bastard's feeding. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know. I swear, I don't know. ",
        "Caleb: You don't understand. We want -- we want Jack to feel that rumble in \r\nhis stomach, that hunger in his veins that will bring him to us. ",
        "Gabriela: The blood bank. ",
        "Caleb: What? ",
        "Gabriela: There's blood missing from the supply at the hospital. I caught \r\nJack's friend Jamal Woods there. He must be draining the bank to feed Jack. ",
        "Caleb: Good girl. Oh, you are such a good girl. I think you deserve a little \r\nreward. Would you like to put in a request? ",
        "Gabriela: Surprise me. You know what I want. ",
        "Caleb: To be the one for all time. ",
        "Gabriela: To belong to you. ",
        "Caleb: You do, but not as my bride. There's already been another chosen. You \r\nknow that. ",
        "Gabriela: Caleb, I want to be the -- ",
        "Caleb: Ah, ah, ah. No, no, no. Olivia will be my bride. I'll accept no other. \r\nBut we'll find something just as satisfying for you. ",
        "Gabriela: Satisfy me. ",
        "Caleb: Uh-uh. Business first. First we have to deal with Jack's little \r\nblood-stealing friend Jamal. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Come on, Lucy. There was something inside the house that he wanted.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking. ",
        "Kevin: Well, what was it that gave you that vibe? Was it the way he spoke, \r\nthe way he was dressed? ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait. Shh. Just let me focus for a minute. I hear a knock. I get \r\nup, I go to the door. I open the door, and there's the stranger. And -- ",
        "Kevin: And? ",
        "Lucy: His eyes. His eyes were so piercing, like he could see right through \r\nme. No, but that's not what bugged me. What really made me so upset, I think, \r\nwas the fact that he -- he looked at me like he owned me. I hated that. But --\r\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: No, that wasn't it. I wasn't just the way he looked at me. Doc, it was \r\nthat I had to make a choice. I had to choose to stop looking into those eyes. \r\nThey're so blue, really this bright, glowing blue. ",
        "Kevin: But? ",
        "Lucy: Evil. I don't know, that's the only way I can describe them -- just \r\nevil. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you're doing a pretty good job at it. And you're -- you're \r\ncertain that Livvie didn't see him? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I -- I know that. She never came downstairs. She was upstairs \r\nsleeping. What is it? What -- what are you thinking? ",
        "Kevin: That's it. ",
        "Lucy: That's what? What? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, there's only one other person that we know that might've seen \r\nthis man. ",
        "Lucy: Who? ",
        "Kevin: Come on. ",
        "Lucy: Come on? What? Where? ",
        "Kevin: I'll tell you on the way. Just hurry. ",

        "Jack: Better now? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I always feel better in your arms, Jack. You know that. But I \r\nshould be the one who's taking care of you. ",
        "Jack: Hey, it's probably just a bug or something. It'll pass. ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. It feels like you have a fever. ",
        "Jack: Hey. Do you know how much I love you? ",
        "Livvie: The only thing in this world I am sure of is your love. ",
        "Jack: And do you know that the only thing I want to do is hold you close to \r\nme? Keep you safe? ",
        "Livvie: I want that, too, Jack. I want to forget about everything that is \r\nhappening outside of this room. Let's pretend, just for a little while, that \r\nit's only us. ",

        "Jamal: Spunky-spunk. ",

        "Alison: Wait. Do you really think so? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, I really think so. ",
        "Alison: That would really be so great. ",
        "Jamal: I know. I know. Hey, now it's going to be great for us, too. I know we \r\nhaven't been making a lot of time for, you know, you and me, but I'm going to \r\nstart doing that, making up for everything as soon as I get back. I got a quick \r\nerrand to run. Ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok. Wait, wait. Maybe we could just, like, skip all the preparations \r\nand go straight on into the big finale, if your errand could wait. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I'll be thinking \"finale\" the whole time. Ok? But for right now, \r\nI promised Jack, ok? Something I got to take care of right now. ",
        "Alison: Ok. But one errand -- one -- and then you are mine, you got it? ",

        "Gabriela: But? ",
        "Caleb: But if he's undead and with us, he could make it easier getting to \r\nOlivia. And we'll both enjoy watching Jack squirm as he watches his best friend \r\ncross over. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, then you better be careful, Caleb. The cops have a sketch of \r\nyou, you know. ",
        "Caleb: They what? ",
        "Gabriela: Someone remembered your face the other night at the artery bar when \r\nyou were talking to that guy. So the cops are looking for you now. ",

        "Gabriela: What? Me? You want me to turn him alone? ",
        "Caleb: Just mingle your blood with Jamal's. Infect him the way I infected \r\nyou. Then he'll be mine to control. ",
        "Gabriela: But how? ",
        "Caleb: How? You are a sexy, beautiful young woman. You don't need me, \r\nGabriela. Just be irresistible -- and I know you know how to do that. I saw your \r\nnumber at the Nurses Ball. Just bring him to me, and I will be very, very \r\ngrateful. ",
