        "Using Caleb's ring, Jamal wishes to be mortal again, but he's upset to find that he still has fangs. Testing it out with a wish for money, he turns around and finds a large bag filled with hundred-dollar bills. Imani stops by to let him know that he forgot to pay his bill at the Elixir. She finds the bag, which Jamal tried unsuccessfully to stuff inside his refrigerator. Assuring her that he's not a criminal, he gives her $100 to pay for the bill and her tip. Hoping that she had another reason for stopping by, he's disappointed by her reaction but decides not to push her. Instead, he makes another wish and instantly hears her thoughts. He spooks her by echoing her thought that someone is expecting her. Rafe takes Alison back to the warehouse after having her checked out at the hospital. He promises to focus on getting her well and opening their new gym. They find that the warehouse has been vandalized, and the vandal is still there. Attacking the terrified kid with a stake, Rafe demands to know whether Caleb put him up to this. Alison believes the kid's claim that he doesn't know anyone named Caleb--and that he didn't know anyone was living there. She pulls Rafe away, and the kid bolts. Realizing that he almost killed someone who didn't deserve it, Rafe promises to end his obsession with Caleb. At the Elixir, Caleb dances with Stacy and two other vamps. Unhappy with the potential for feeding and unable to prevent it himself, Jack calls Olivia. Seeing Casey yet again, Ricky demands to know why she appears only to him. When she suggests that this is all in his mind, Ricky tries to prove his point by showing her the earring she left behind, but he can't find it. Reese is disappointed by Jack's reminder that their relationship is supposed to be simple. When Olivia arrives at the Elixir and does a sexy dance for Caleb, he excuses himself from the others and takes her outside, where he kisses her passionately."

        "Rafe: You know, I know you didn't really want to go to the hospital, but I wish you would've let them take some of those tests.",
        "Alison: Well, the doctor did examine me.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah, I know, and she said that you definitely need a lot of rest, so come on, I'm going to make sure that you --",

        "Rafe: What?",
        "Alison: Is everything going to be ok?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, what are you talking about? Of course it is. You heard Dr. Heron.",
        "Alison: No, no, I don't mean about that.",
        "Rafe: I mean, come on, she was 100% sure -- or almost 100% sure that Joshua's drugs were almost out of your system.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not worried about my health right now. I'm more concerned about us and our lives together. I mean, are we going to be able to move on with our lives?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah, that's -- that's what we're doing. We're moving on with our lives.",
        "Alison: Ok, good, because before, I mean, what you said, it didn't really sound like that.",
        "Rafe: Well, I'm having a hard time with you accepting Caleb as a friend, yeah. I can never trust that guy.",
        "Alison: But you're not going to really let that come between us, though, right?",
        "Rafe: No, because I'm going to be too busy focusing on our new and incredible life together.",
        "Alison: Ok, well, I hope so.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes. We'll focus on all the good stuff.",

        "Caleb: I tell you what, I'll finish it for you -- \"stop seeing Alison or it's over.\" I'll tell you what, I have no problem with not seeing Alison anymore. What I do have a problem with is being told what to do. So here's the answer to your ultimatum.",

        "Jamal: Oh, you know, whatever it is, it's fine. What brings you here to my shop?",
        "Imani: Actually, it's about your bill at Elixir. I'm sure you did not mean to leave without paying, but you did.",

        "Imani: Yeah, no problem. You know, in fact, if you want to come by Elixir later and take care of it --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: I know what this looks like, and it's probably not what you're thinking.",
        "Imani: And what would that be?",
        "Jamal: I don't know, that I'm a gangster or a drug dealer or something.",
        "Imani: You know, I'm really not one to make snap judgments.",
        "Jamal: I know, but, you know, all this money sitting here and everything is --",
        "Imani: Hey, if you want to keep your money in your fridge, that's your business.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, I usually don't. But ever since that attempted bank robbery, I don't trust security too much.",
        "Imani: Listen, you don't even owe me any explanations, really. Just, you know, if you want to pay your bill, I will get out of your hair.",
        "Jamal: I'll do that. Wouldn't happen to have change for 100, do you?",
        "Imani: No.",
        "Jamal: How about, just keep the change.",
        "Imani: That's a really big tip.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, considering all the trouble you went through, it's worth it. Thank you.",

        "Boy: Stop, don't hurt me! Please, mister, I'm begging you!",
        "Rafe: What the hell were you doing here?",
        "Boy: I'm sorry! I didn't know anyone lived here!",
        "Rafe: You expect me to believe that?",
        "Boy: I was just being a jerk, blowing off steam!",
        "Rafe: Just tell me the truth! Who you put you up to this, huh? Who put you up to this? Was it Caleb? Was it Caleb",
        "Boy: I don't -- I don't know any Caleb.",
        "Rafe: Tell me the truth or you're dead! Was it Caleb?",
        "Boy: I swear, I swear I don't know a Caleb! Please don't hurt me! Please!",
        "Alison: Look, Rafe, I don't think it's what you think it is. Seriously, it's just a kid. Let him go. Back off. No, no, no. It's not what you think.",
        "Rafe: My god. I almost killed him. Just a kid. What's happening to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Why are you doing this, huh? Why do you just keep popping up out of nowhere and appearing to me and only me?",
        "Casey: Hey, don't try to understand it, ok? Just go with it.",
        "Ricky: Go?",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Ricky: No, no, I can't just go with it, ok? I need to know what's going on.",
        "Casey: All right, well, what makes you so sure it's something that I'm doing, hmm?",
        "Ricky: What does that mean?",
        "Casey: Maybe it's all in your pretty little head.",
        "Ricky: What?",
        "Casey: As in you can't let me go.",
        "Ricky: No. No, no, no. That is so not it.",
        "Casey: Oh?",
        "Ricky: Because I got proof, all right? I can prove it. The last time you were here, I found one of your earrings.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Ricky: Yeah, it's right here in my pocket and I'm going to show you.",
        "Casey: Ok.",

        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Reese: There's something really weird going on with Ricky.",
        "Jack: And you're just noticing?",
        "Reese: No, I'm serious, he's acting really strange.",
        "Jack: Strange how?",
        "Reese: Strange as in he's outside having a perfectly animated conversation with absolutely no one.",
        "Jack: Reese, Ricky is a freak, ok? Whatever he does outside, I don't care. Only thing I'm worried about is what goes on in here.",
        "Reese: Wow. They look like they're having a good time, don't they?",
        "Jack: Too good of a time.",
        "Reese: So when did you become such a prude?",
        "Jack: When they started baring fangs. I don't want them scaring away any business.",
        "Reese: You know, if you ask me, you could sell tickets. That's some steamy floorshow right there.",
        "Jack: Yeah, not for long it's not.",
        "Reese: Jack? What have you got up your sleeve?",
        "Jack: I don't know, stick around and you'll find out.",
        "Woman: You are so scrumptious.",
        "Second woman: I'd love to take a great big bite out of you.",
        "Third woman: I wouldn't mind a nibble myself.",
        "Caleb: Well, I'm not going to spoil any of your fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: I'm not sure what you're asking me, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Well, I just thought there was another reason why you came by.",
        "Imani: And what other reason would I have?",
        "Jamal: Look, I just figured that, you know, you might want to make friends, so you might want to open up a little bit.",
        "Imani: Oh, who says I want to make friends?",
        "Jamal: I guess I just assumed with you being new in town and everything that -- you know what, you're right, I'm not going to push it. I just wish I knew what you were thinking, that's all.",
        "Imani: Well, I'm thinking that I really need to go.",
        "Imani's voice: I have to get out of here now. They're expecting me.",
        "Jamal: Who's expecting you?",
        "Imani: What?",
        "Jamal: Is somebody expecting you?",
        "Imani: No, I -- I have to go. I will see you later.",
        "Jamal: Ok way to scare her off, J. You're starting to have a real talent for that, I'll tell you. But what does she mean, \"they're expecting me\"? Hmm? She's off work. She doesn't want any friends. So who the hell are \"they\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Nobody -- nobody was hurt, ok?",
        "Rafe: Wait a sec. Somebody was going to be hurt, I mean, if you didn't stop me.",
        "Alison: Everybody makes mistakes. Don't go blaming yourself.",
        "Rafe: No, no, not me, not me. I shouldn't have, not like that. I mean, you know, I'm supposed to be trained, you know, I'm supposed to know what I'm doing.",
        "Alison: You do know what you're doing.",
        "Rafe: No. No. You were right. You know, you were right, I've been so obsessed with Caleb and blaming him for everything bad that happens to us, I walked in here and I saw this place the way it is and I just -- I couldn't help thinking --",
        "Alison: I think that you're having a really hard time believing that this whole war is over with him.",
        "Rafe: It is, isn't it?",
        "Alison: I mean, it's completely over.",
        "Rafe: Ok. This all ends now. And I promise I'm going to take care of it.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, what ends now?",
        "Rafe: This whole thing between me and Caleb. Yeah, it has to be resolved once and for all.",
        "Alison: Ok, you're starting to scare me a little bit. You're not going to do anything foolish, are you?",
        "Rafe: I don't know if it's foolish or not. I just know I cannot lose you, not for anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Why are you doing this, Casey, huh? Why are you trying to make me think that I'm going crazy?",
        "Casey: Look, look, I'm not doing anything like that, ok? Look, I love you. I love you, ok? You just got to stop questioning me about all this stuff that's happening because, sweetie, you may not like the answer.",
        "Woman: Ricky Garza?",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Woman: I saw you on TV. Could I get your autograph?",
        "Ricky: Yeah, of course.",
        "Woman: Thank you so much. I just think you're the coolest.",
        "Ricky: I'm glad you like the music. All right, Casey -- Casey? Casey, where'd you go? I'm really losing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: What are you doing here?",
        "Caleb: There's room for one more.",
        "Livvie: No, thanks. I think I'll make some fun of my own.",
        "Jack: So what are you going to do about your boyfriend there?",
        "Livvie: Nothing. He's having fun.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Reese: So that's what you did. You called Livvie.",
        "Jack: Yep, that's what I did.",
        "Reese: Well, I mean, why would you want Livvie to see Caleb with those girls? Are you trying to break them up or something?",
        "Jack: Reese, no, because I wanted her to get Caleb out of here.",
        "Reese: You sure you're over her? Her and Tess?",
        "Jack: I can't believe you're even asking me this.",
        "Reese: Well, I'm just some girl, ok? It's -- it's a girl thing.",
        "Jack: Hey, look, I know you're a girl.",
        "Reese: We just have to check up on that, all right, you know?",
        "Jack: Right. Well, nothing to worry about because I'm over both of them.",
        "Reese: Are you ready to get out of here?",
        "Jack: I wish I could, but I have to stick around to make sure things are cool.",
        "Reese: All right, so why don't you just give me your key and I'll just meet you back at your place?",
        "Jack: Ok, if that's what you want.",
        "Reese: Actually, don't you think it'd be a better idea if I just had my own key made, you know, just save the hassle?",
        "Jack: Uh -- ooh. Uh -- Reese, I, uh -- don't take this the wrong way, but, I mean, we're both not looking for something heavy. That's what I thought, at least. I mean, it's not a good idea.",
        "Reese: Yeah, sure. Ok.",
        "Jack: Good, I'm glad we both agree.",
        "Reese: Right.",
        "Jack: Look, I'll see you at the house. I got to get back to work, ok?",
