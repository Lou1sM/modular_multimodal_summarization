        "After assuring Olivia that there's no need to be afraid of him anymore, Kevin fills his daughter in on why he acted so horribly toward her and everyone else in his life. They reconcile, and Kevin listens as she blames Alison for everything that has ever gone wrong for her. In his professional opinion, she is going to drive Caleb away with her nagging. He advises her to show Caleb that she's the best thing that's ever happened to him. He also wants her to let go of her vendetta against Alison. At the hospital, Chris is pleased to report that Alison's system is free of Joshua's drugs. Elizabeth advises her daughter to start over without Rafe, since their relationship is so plagued with problems. Alison reacts by attacking her mother over her inability to hold onto a relationship of her own. Chris offers comfort to Elizabeth in the form of conversation and martinis. At Rafe's request, Caleb meets the slayer at the overlook, where they work out a truce. Rafe also demands that Caleb stay away from Alison. Amused, Caleb challenges him to force Alison to stay away from him. Lucy holds out hope that Kevin's about-face is for real, but Ian suspects that he's up to something again. When Kevin shows up unexpectedly and hands Lucy the divorce papers, he points out that he wants regular visitations with Christina. Alison is painting the brick walls inside the warehouse when Olivia pays a visit."

        "Ian: All right, I learned something. Turns out \"goodnight moon\" is good only for nighttime, not naps. Didn't know that.",
        "Lucy: Um, I told you that. You just didn't believe me.",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Christina's adamant about that. How's Danny?",
        "Ian: He's good. They're in there playing. And you're right, he does belong with us.",
        "Lucy: So -- say that again? I was right? You hate that. I was right, wasn't I? I'm right. Ok. Um, you know, I was thinking --",
        "Ian: What?",
        "Lucy: I'm a little -- well, \"baffled\" is kind of a strong word. I'm a little disconcerted.",
        "Ian: Ok, about what? Kevin?",
        "Lucy: I just -- nothing he could do to me anymore surprises me, but this seemingly turnaround here --",
        "Ian: Well, that's just it -- you think he can just turn from, what, some kind of a monster into a decent human being? You really believe that?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. But he was. At one time, he was decent. Do you believe that?",
        "Ian: He was. Maybe so. Maybe he was at one point, yeah.",
        "Lucy: Ok, do you think -- you think he could maybe change?",
        "Ian: It doesn't ring true to me. I think he's setting you up for another fall.",
        "Lucy: All right, maybe. It's just I know what I said to Jamal, I mean, when I was talking to him about Kevin and all the bad stuff. I said, \"I wish he could be a decent man again, that he could be the man that we all used to care about.\" And I sort of wished it out loud, so I'm just -- I'm just saying, could that wish come true? Is it possible?",
        "Ian: I think it'd be good for the universe and it'd be great for Kevin, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Dad, hi. I didn't see you. Sorry.",
        "Kevin: It's amazing, I was just looking for you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, um, Caleb will be here soon.",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm sure he will.",
        "Livvie: In fact, I'm just going to go and see --",
        "Kevin: Please don't run from me. You don't have to be afraid of me now. I promise.",
        "Livvie: You said you were looking for me?",
        "Kevin: I wanted to say I'm sorry.",
        "Livvie: Sorry?",
        "Kevin: Livvie, you have no reason to trust me now.",
        "Livvie: Dad, the last time I saw you, you were chasing me, and the look in your eyes, I thought --",
        "Kevin: Joshua got me on drugs. I know that's not an excuse, but at least it is some kind of an explanation. Honey, I have a lot of regrets. I've been a terrible father, I've been a lousy husband, and I've been a worse friend.",
        "Livvie: Wow, that's one big \"I'm sorry.\"",
        "Kevin: Look, I know this is sudden, but I can tell you this feels more right than anything I've done in a long time. And I want my daughter back. I -- I miss you, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: I miss you, too, dad.",
        "Kevin: Huh. Well -- so, how are you?",
        "Livvie: Well, I'd probably be a lot better if Alison Barrington would just leave us alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Well, it looks good. Joshua's drugs are completely out of your system.",
        "Alison: Oh, thank you.",
        "Chris: You're welcome. You know, you should consider yourself lucky. Kevin took 10 times longer to detox and he suffered quite a bit.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do feel very lucky. It was much harder to be on the drugs than it was to actually get off of the drugs.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, you know what, it's all -- all over now.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: Clean slate, right?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Elizabeth: Right, so thank you very much for taking care of her. I appreciate that.",
        "Chris: Anytime.",
        "Alison: Thanks, Chris.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Alison, this is -- this is great. A clean bill of health.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: Joshua's gone forever. And, well, I suppose you're going to go back to your sweet, little, happy life with Rafe.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm going to try, anyway.",
        "Elizabeth: Honey, I know that you were under the influence of drugs when you stabbed him, but, you know, it just seems like it's one more in a long series of signs that your relationship really has more than its share of troubles.",
        "Alison: Thank you. But I do love him, mother.",
        "Elizabeth: I know. Alison, love doesn't always last forever.",
        "Alison: Well, ours does.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, honey, it's a long, rocky road, and there's going to be hills and there's going to be valleys, and those valleys just get --",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, are you trying to say something?",
        "Elizabeth: No, don't you see, I'm saying that they get dark and sometimes endless, that you're in these --",
        "Alison: Ok, enough with the valleys. Just spit it out if you're trying to say something. You've never been shy before. Go ahead.",
        "Elizabeth: I just think that this is the perfect opportunity for a brand-new beginning and you should take advantage of this, Alison. Just start over, just brand-new, but by yourself, without Rafe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: What a nice-looking town.",
        "Rafe: I like it. Come here. See right over there? See that steeple? That's the church where Alison and I almost got married.",
        "Caleb: Yep, that's the one.",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm. Thanks for that, by the way. And right there -- right over there, there's G.H. And a little bit to the left, that's the recovery room. Oh, I'm sorry -- Elixir.",
        "Caleb: You know, something tells me you didn't invite me up here to admire the view.",
        "Rafe: Well, it's just that standing up here, it all really hits you, you know? Port Charles is actually a lot smaller than what it feels like when you're down there living in it. Come on, you know the old saying -- \"this town just isn't big enough for the both of us.\"",
        "Caleb: I like it here, too, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Hmm.",
        "Caleb: No plans on leaving.",
        "Rafe: Well, neither do I.",
        "Caleb: Well, since we've got that settled, I'll see you around.",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh. Aren't you tired of this same endless battle that neither one of us is ever going to win?",
        "Caleb: You got a better idea?",
        "Rafe: Well, as a matter of fact, I do. A truce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: It seems like every time I turn around, Alison Barrington has found another way to make my life a little bit more miserable.",
        "Kevin: Well, you know, honey, someone can hurt you only if you let them.",
        "Livvie: Alison has done nothing but hurt me, and anytime I don't allow her to, everybody accuses me of all kinds of criminal behavior.",
        "Kevin: Well, what has she done now?",
        "Livvie: Calculating, manipulating. Trying to get every man I'm interested in against me by being their best friend.",
        "Kevin: Caleb and Alison?",
        "Livvie: Yeah. The minute her and Rafe get into a fight, which is a lot these days after she stabbed him, she goes running to him, crying on his shoulder, batting her baby blues. Like, that's my man.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Have you told Caleb how you feel about it?",
        "Livvie: He thinks I'm nuts and I'm jealous.",
        "Kevin: Are you? Jealous, I mean?",
        "Livvie: . In fact, the other night, just right over there, three girls, totally hot, all over Caleb. I didn't care. I didn't even blink an eye.",
        "Kevin: But when it comes to Alison?",
        "Livvie: It's different. He's got a big, fat blind spot there, and no matter how many times I try and tell him --",
        "Kevin: Over and over and over again, ad nauseam, I bet.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, sometimes you've just got to do whatever you've got to do to get a man's attention.",
        "Kevin: Ok. I can tell you that's not the way to get a man to listen. And I don't think the problem is Alison. I think it's you.",
        "Livvie: Should I sign you up for her fan club now?",
        "Kevin: No, I'm just saying that I think your behavior is a textbook example of how to drive a man away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I seem to recall that you were the one that declared an end to our ceasefire. Now, what would change your mind?",
        "Rafe: Well -- ahem -- I'm just tired of the battle.",
        "Caleb: Oh, I don't think so. No. No. The old balance of power? I believe you think somehow it shifted in your favor. Now, what would give you that idea?",
        "Rafe: Well, you tell me. I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Caleb: I'll tell you, nothing makes you more agreeable than thinking you pulled one over on me. The ring?",
        "Rafe: Right, the ring. Well, I still don't have your damn ring. That's not why we're here, ok?",
        "Caleb: Why are we here?",
        "Rafe: Because I am tired of playing the games. I don't want to do it anymore. You know what I want? I want to finally marry Alison. If you thought about this -- if you thought about this for just one minute, you would realize that you and I, we're actually not so different. You do want to make music, right? You want the whole big, beautiful rock-star life. But you know what you want more than anything? You want to share that life with Olivia.",
        "Caleb: So what's stopping us from both getting what we want?",
        "Rafe: Nothing. Well, except each other. But if we do this right, if we play this right, if we agree to peace in our time, then we can both have what really matters to us most.",
        "Caleb: And if we don't agree?",
        "Rafe: Well, hmm. Then nobody gets to live happily ever after.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: I look at you now, you're healthy, perfect, and -- and I think about how I almost lost you.",
        "Lucy: Well, you didn't because you fought so hard for me.",
        "Ian: No, we fought for us. But now, I don't know about you, but I'm tired of fighting. I need a break.",
        "Lucy: Me, too, but you think that's possible?",
        "Ian: I do. And I know things aren't perfect, but maybe we can get rid of some of the things that stood in the way of our happiness.",
        "Lucy: One of them being Kevin?",
        "Ian: Yeah. You know, I hope he's better, for his sake. But, you know, it doesn't really matter if it's Kevin the great or Kevin the lunatic, he's only going to keep coming to your door until you --",
        "Lucy: Till I what?",
        "Ian: Until you decide not to open up. Look at me. This is our time now. This is our chance at happiness. Find out who we really are.",
        "Lucy: I know who we really are. I know who you are. You are the absolute bravest, the most amazing, kindest hero.",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know I'm a hero, I know, and you're the most incredible woman I've ever laid eyes on, but I'm not even talking about that right now. I'm talking about everyday, ordinary stuff. You know, I don't even know what section of the paper you read first in the morning.",
        "Lucy: Easy -- horoscopes.",
        "Ian: Should've guess that, huh?",
        "Lucy: Hmm.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Lucy: And then I read the sports page. I check the hockey scores, and then I I go to the business section.",
        "Ian: I didn't know that.",
        "Lucy: Wow, I guess you're right. We've barely scratched each other's surface, huh?",
        "Ian: If I had a wish, I would close the door on the rest of the world and just be here with you, with our family. And I would find out every single particular detail about you.",
        "Lucy: Let's do that. Let's forget about everything -- Kevin, everything -- and just concentrate on you and me, and shut the rest of the world out.",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: How can you say that I am driving Caleb away? And honestly, daddy, that's not helping. You're not helping me at all.",
        "Kevin: Well, it might if you're willing to hear me out. Of course you're jealous of Alison. You've given her all this power over your life.",
        "Livvie: No, that is not true.",
        "Kevin: Yes, it is.",
        "Livvie: I haven't given her anything.",
        "Kevin: Yes, you have. Take it back. You just realize what a treasure you are.",
        "Livvie: Me?",
        "Kevin: Yes. Absolutely know that you're enough for Caleb. That falling in love with you is the best thing that ever happened to him.",
        "Livvie: How do I do that?",
        "Kevin: You have to let Caleb love you the way that he's capable. And, honey, you have to let go of this vendetta for Alison, please, for the sake of your own happiness.",
        "Livvie: Dad, I've tried, but every time I turn around, Alison is there.",
        "Kevin: Honey, honey, honey, a great place to start is to try to go for one hour without saying the word \"Alison.\"",
        "Livvie: But I hate her, dad.",
        "Kevin: It doesn't matter. Just let it go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Well, isn't that just your answer for everything. If a relationship gets hard, well, then just walk right out on it. That's your perfect example.",
        "Elizabeth: No, Alison, it's just that I think --",
        "Alison: I've seen your idea of a long-term relationship, mother.",
        "Elizabeth: Excuse me, I spent 20 long years with your father.",
        "Alison: Yeah, they were long years, but you didn't exactly work at the relationship, you didn't work at your marriage.",
        "Elizabeth: What, so now it's my fault?",
        "Alison: Well, it's not just your fault. But lately, mother, I feel like you've been jumping into any guy's bed that extends a hand to you.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison!",
        "Alison: It's true.",
        "Elizabeth: That's a terrible thing to say!",
        "Alison: It's true. And then you get so upset when they leave you. You're, like, broken-hearted and can't understand why relationships are so difficult these days. I'm sorry, mother, but right now, I mean, is it any wonder that people think that you're as deep as a wading pool?",
        "Chris: You ok?",
        "Elizabeth: I'm fine.",
        "Alison: I'm going to fix this, Rafe. We're going to get this back. I just know it. We're going to have a family, we're going to have a home, we're going to open up the gym, and everything is going to be just fine. I promise you, we will fix this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: So how do you see this whole truce working? Just divide the city down the middle, you take the east side, I'll take the west side?",
        "Rafe: Ok, well, here's the thing -- see, Joshua's plan is history. So if I get one wind of hearing that you're trying to turn this into some kind of vampire- land, I'm going to be after you quick, you won't see me coming.",
        "Caleb: Joshua was an idiot. His plan lacked any semblance of honor or nobility.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Ok, now, if that's not your way, if your way is honor and nobility, then you'll do me a big favor and keep your vampires in check.",
        "Caleb: So far I'm only hearing a lot about what I'm supposed to do and not a lot of quid or quo.",
        "Rafe: Ok. I and any other slayers will stay out of your way.",
        "Caleb: I can live with that.",
        "Rafe: Good. Oh. Ahem. Just one more thing.",
        "Caleb: The other shoe drops.",
        "Rafe: Stay away from Alison.",
        "Caleb: Maybe Olivia's not the only one who's jealous.",
        "Rafe: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, I'm not jealous. I'm worried. See, Livvie's insecurity is its own kind of monster, and every time your eye wanders a little bit, your -- your little wife goes a little crazy, and that puts Alison in danger.",
        "Caleb: I have no problem staying away from Alison. See if she can stay away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I had no idea how vicious she could be. My own daughter.",
        "Chris: I know. It's -- it's shocking.",
        "Elizabeth: She said I was shallow.",
        "Chris: Well, come on, you know, it's always been my personal opinion that being, you know, deep is highly overrated.",
        "Elizabeth: She accused me of sleeping around.",
        "Chris: Great. Oh, I mean, what, that's a problem? Come on.",
        "Elizabeth: Are you ever serious about anything?",
        "Chris: My cocktails. Speaking of which -- might be a good idea to go join me, you know, in a pitcher of nice, dry, cold, shallow martinis?",
        "[Elizabeth sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: So we're agreed, then?",
        "Lucy: That you work nicely?",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: Yes. No, we're agreed, yeah, that it's just you and me. We're going to shut out the rest of the world and just spend time with us.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ian: Well there you go. Two seconds of bliss and the world comes knocking.",
        "Lucy: I will get rid of whoever it is, unless -- ok, this is our first deal in the world of us. People have to call first before they ever come over, right?",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Right.",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry if I'm interrupting.",
        "Lucy: You are. And can whatever it is wait?",
        "Kevin: Uh, yeah. I just thought this would be better done in person.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Kevin: Our divorce papers.",
        "Ian: What are you up to, Collins?",
        "Kevin: Just trying to keep it clean and simple. That would mean the only loose end is Christina. Look, I just want to work out regular visitations with her. She needs to know she has a relationship with her father, and I need her, too.",
        "Lucy: Fine. I need to look over this.",
        "Kevin: It's a pretty straightforward document. The dissolution of Dr. And Mrs. Collins. Well, sorry to interrupt again. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "Lucy: So you were right this time about he was just going to come knocking. I didn't think he'd come knocking with divorce papers, though.",
        "Ian: You ok?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm fine. I need to read this, I guess. I guess I should call my attorney and just let him know the latest development huh? I'll get his number.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I am sure Alison will manage to get along without your so-called friendship.",
        "Caleb: Yeah? Tell you what -- forbid Alison to talk to me. That's a little conversation I'd buy a ticket to.",
        "Rafe: Do we have a deal or not?",
        "Caleb: Why not.",
        "Rafe: Truce.",
        "Caleb: Now, in the spirit of peaceful co-existence, I'm going to share something with you that I know about human nature.",
        "Rafe: This should be good.",
        "Caleb: Forbid someone to do something, especially a woman, and that becomes the only thing they want.",
        "Rafe: Thanks, I appreciate that, but you know what, you've got enough problems of your own. Speaking of which, I hope you and that insane person who used to call herself my wife, by the way, have a wonderful eternity together.",
        "Caleb: And I hope you and the blond are happy for that blink of an instant that you call a lifetime.",
        "Rafe: So it's settled. Me and Alison, you and Olivia, and never the twain shall meet.",
        "Caleb: Settled.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Alison: We're not open for business yet!",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's pretty obvious. Because I'm not here to join a club. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",

        "Kevin: Lucy is living with you and Christina -- my wife, my daughter.",
        "Jamal: What would you do if you had your hands on that ring?",
