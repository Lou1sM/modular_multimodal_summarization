        "Kevin: Come on, judge, don't do this! ",
        "Lucy: Doc, all you did was show him this -- this picture, and he collapsed \r\nlike that? What happened? Why? What -- ",
        "Chris: Coming through. What do we got? ",
        "Kevin: He's a -- he's in arrest and I can't get a pulse. ",
        "Chris: He's in v-fib. Charge to 300. ",
        "[Beeping stops] ",
        "Chris: Clear. ",
        "Kevin: He's asystole. ",
        "Chris: Five milligrams of epi. Let it circulate for a while. Still asystole. \r\nI'm going to have to call it. ",
        "Lucy: He's -- he's really -- ",
        "Chris: Dead? Yeah, very. What happened? ",
        "Lucy: Um -- we have no idea. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Careful. Don't put any weight on that ankle. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. As if I could. I can't thank you enough, Jamal, for bringing \r\nme home. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Well, you're safe now. I'm just glad I could help. ",
        "Gabriela: When that guy started chasing me, I felt so helpless. I've never \r\nbeen so glad to see anyone. I owe you. ",
        "Jamal: Forget about it. Look, I'll scope out your place, make sure everything \r\nis locked up tight before I split, ok? ",
        "Gabriela: Would you? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm still really shaken up. ",
        "Jamal: No problem. ",
        "Gabriela: This is your lucky night, Jamal. ",

        "Jack: Oh -- I can't -- ",
        "Livvie: Hey. What? What is it, Jack? Something I said? Something I did? \r\nWhat's going on? ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I just got to get out of here. ",
        "Livvie: Can we please just talk about this? ",
        "Jack: No, look, you have to stay here in the dorm, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Jack, don't walk out on me, please! ",
        "Jack: Look, I have to go! ",
        "Livvie: Ow. ",
        "Jack: All right? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God. Oh, Jack, I'm losing you. ",
        "",
        "Chris: I don't understand. This patient was just on a psychiatric hold. ",
        "Lucy: We told you. He just -- he just keeled over. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you don't have to cover for me. ",
        "Chris: Cover for you? What is she covering? ",
        "Kevin: All I did was show the judge a picture of the man that I believe \r\nattacked him and -- ",
        "Chris: Wait, let me get this straight. You showed a terrified, traumatized \r\nold man a picture of the guy who attacked him, and he dropped dead? ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, at least we were at a hospital. ",
        "Chris: Is this some sort of radical new shock treatment, doctor? Where did \r\nyou learn to practice psychiatry? ",
        "Lucy: He was trying to help the man when this happened. He was helping him.\r\n",
        "Chris: Yes, he was helping him -- to an early grave. ",
        "Lucy: I don't like what you're insinuating. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Chris is right. I should've known better. Judge Kurland's death \r\nis my fault. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Jamal, open up! ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok, I'm coming. Keep your pants on! ",
        "Jack: Alison, I need to talk to Jamal now. ",
        "Alison: Well, it's nice to see you, too. ",
        "Jack: I need to talk to him -- now. ",
        "Alison: Look, Jack, you're not exactly getting on my good side with that kind \r\nof -- ",
        "Jack: Alison, please just tell me where he is. ",
        "Alison: He went to go run an errand. He's going to be right back. Actually, \r\nhe's a little late. Why don't you come inside and cool your heels? ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, I can't. Look, just -- just tell Jamal that I came by \r\nlooking for him, all right? ",
        "Alison: Well, wait. I -- I made some food. I mean, you must be hungry. It's \r\nsomething that you would love. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I doubt it. ",
        "Alison: Well, why don't you just come in and wait like a normal person? ",
        "Jack: I can't, Alison! Don't you get it? I can't! ",
        "Alison: Hey, Jack, you're starting to scare me a little bit. Ok, is there \r\nsomething the matter? Where -- where is Livvie? ",
        "Jack: No, no. Just stay away from me. If you know what's best for you, you'll \r\nstay away. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: All right. I checked out your apartment top to bottom. Everything's \r\ncool. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm still shaking. Feel my hands. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. You're safe now, ok? ",
        "Gabriela: Thanks to you. ",
        "Jamal: Hmm. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, would you stay with me for just a few minutes? Just until my \r\nheart stops racing? ",
        "Jamal: You know, I really got to bounce. Alison's waiting for me. I mean, \r\nmaybe you should call your brother. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't want to scare my family. I'm usually so sensible, so in \r\ncontrol. I don't know why I'm still such a mess. ",
        "Jamal: All right, tell me what happened tonight, then. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I was on my way home, and I took a shortcut through the \r\nalley. Then I heard footsteps. ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Gabriela: And so I ran. But whoever was chasing me ran faster. ",
        "Jamal: Well, did you get a look at the guy? ",
        "Gabriela: He had the most mesmerizing, amazing eyes. They were incredible.\r\n",
        "Jamal: So you stared deeply into his eyes? ",
        "Gabriela: What do -- what do you mean? ",
        "Jamal: Well, usually when you're running from someone, Gabriela, you try not \r\nto look at their face. I mean, I don't know. It just doesn't seem like you're \r\nexactly afraid of this guy. ",
        "Gabriela: No, what I meant was his eyes were so chilling, I couldn't help but \r\nlook at them. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Gabriela: You know that feeling right before something awful happens, when \r\nyou know you should run but you can't? That's what this felt like. ",
        "Jamal: What's wrong? Did he hurt you? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know. I must've pulled a muscle or something when I fell, \r\nbut my neck is really sore. ",
        "Jamal: Your neck? Maybe it's something else. ",
        "Gabriela: Like what? ",
        "Jamal: Like maybe I should take a look and see. ",
        "Gabriela: Would you? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: All right. No marks. No bruises or anything. You're all right. ",
        "Gabriela: Would you rub my neck for just a bit? ",
        "Jamal: I -- ",
        "Gabriela: It might give me some relief. ",
        "Jamal: All right, look, if it'd make you feel better, yeah. Come on. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: This too hard? ",
        "Gabriela: No. It's just right. ",
        "Gabriela: You know, Jamal, you've been so good to me. I feel like I should \r\ngive you some kind of reward. And I know just the thing. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Chris, you're actually enjoying yourself, aren't you? You would love to \r\nget something on Kevin. Well, that's not going to happen, but I do bet you're \r\ntap-dancing inside. Maybe a little flamenco, huh? ",
        "Chris: No, actually, it's an Irish jig. You know it's my duty to report this \r\nto Alan. ",
        "Lucy: And you don't know what you're doing. ",
        "Chris: Neither does your boyfriend. I'm not the one with the dead patient.\r\n",
        "Lucy: No, but you are the one that's just a lowly resident. A little, \r\nweaselly, lowly, resident. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, calm down. ",
        "Lucy: I'm the board, Chris. I can be very vocal if I want to be, and I could \r\ncost you your job. So if I were you, I'd watch it. ",
        "Chris: Are you threatening me? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, you bet your sweet aspirin. ",
        "Kevin: Will you two please go back to your corners? Lucy, you don't need to \r\nfight my battles for me. And, you, you don't have to go whisper into Alan's ear \r\nbecause I'm going to tell him myself. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. So there. Doc, do you think that's really such a good idea? ",
        "Chris: Kevin -- why don't you tell me? What were you hoping to accomplish by \r\nshowing the judge that picture? ",
        "Kevin: I was trying to break through to him. I was trying to restore him to \r\nsome degree of mental health. ",
        "Lucy: Something you are completely clueless about. ",
        "Kevin: I mean, the man has been unresponsive for days now. ",
        "Chris: If you thought he was unresponsive before -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Look, for your information, we think that maybe the judge was \r\nattacked by a person who committed three murders, and this attack happened in \r\nthe same woods where your brother got hurt. ",
        "Chris: You think there's a connection between what happened to Jack and this \r\nguy? ",
        "Kevin: Nothing concrete, but there is a possibility. ",
        "Lucy: That's what we were trying to find out from the judge. We wanted to ask \r\nhim about his attacker. ",
        "Kevin: And find out if there were any connections, but now we'll never know.\r\n",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, there really are still a lot of similarities. ",
        "Chris: Like what? ",
        "Lucy: Like the fact that Jack and Abe were both attacked in the same area of \r\nthe woods. And after this attack, their whole behavior -- everything changed. \r\nThey started acting completely bizarre. ",
        "Kevin: And suddenly, they had these new reserves of strength. We had trouble \r\nsedating them. ",
        "Chris: I see. Well, Kevin -- I'm sorry. Maybe I was a little out of line \r\nbefore. ",
        "Lucy: Maybe? ",
        "Chris: I'm just saying that I understand what you were trying to do now. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'm sure his widow will be happy to hear it. ",
        "Chris: I'll talk to Alan. I'll let him know that you had no wrongdoing in \r\nthis. Sometimes these things just happen. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, he just did a complete about-face. He is up to something, that \r\nlittle weasel. Did you see how beady his eyes got? ",
        "Kevin: His eyes are always beady. Frankly, I don't care what Chris does. It's \r\nwhat I did. I never should've shown that picture to Judge Kurland. It cost him \r\nhis life, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, you -- you did not kill the man. This -- this monster, this \r\nstranger did. This man is out there killing people, and we have to find out \r\nwhere he is and what he wants before he kills again. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I remember when you couldn't wait to be with me, and tonight you \r\ncouldn't wait to get out that door. Why don't you want me? ",

        "[Rock splashes] ",
        "Alison: Hey, Jack. What is it with this river, buddy? Didn't you ever go to a \r\nnice, warm coffee shop when you're feeling blue? ",
        "Jack: You shouldn't be here, ok, so please get away. ",
        "Alison: Like I'm going to walk away from a friend who is in trouble. I don't \r\nthink so, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Alison, I shouldn't be around anybody right now. ",
        "Alison: You know, sometimes we all feel like that, but that's no reason to \r\nact all crazy like this. ",
        "Jack: You don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Alison: So then enlighten me. I've got all night. ",
        "Jack: Go! Just go! Go back to your nice, little life where nothing bad \r\nhappens, ok? Just go. Just leave me alone! ",
        "Alison: Where the hell have you been? Ok, look, Jack. You have been really \r\nupset ever since the race. I know that there's something really bugging you, or \r\nam I talking to your evil twin now? ",
        "Jack: Just listen to me, ok? If you really care about me, you'll just leave \r\nme alone. That's all I'm asking. ",
        "Alison: Jack, we've all had our bad days. Maybe you've had some -- some bad \r\nweeks, ok, but -- is this about Livvie? ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so then I'm getting warmer. ",
        "Jack: Alison, this isn't a game, ok? Now for the last time, will you please \r\njust get away? ",
        "Alison: Look, stop with this whole broody thing. Ok, Jack, I know the real \r\nyou. ",
        "Jack: Well, you're in for a surprise. Ok? Now, please, just get away from me!\r\n",
        "Alison: Why won't you at least look at me? ",
        "Jack: Because I don't want you to see what I am. ",
        "Alison: I know what you are -- you're my friend, and you're Jamal's friend, \r\ntoo. Jack -- ",
        "Jack: Well, maybe you should go get another friend, ok? ",
        "Alison: Well, I kind of like the one that I have. Look, Jack, you've always \r\nbeen there for me when I've been in some real trouble. I could always count on \r\nyou. I just want to return the favor. I want to help you if I can. Please, how \r\nbad can it be? ",
        "Jack: You really want to know? Look at your buddy now. Yeah. Take a good \r\nlook. Still want to hang out now? ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Just let me give you a little something -- ",
        "Jamal: You know, let me -- let me give you something. Ok? Advice. Just get \r\nsome rest and don't be cutting through any more alleys. Look, I really got to \r\nget out of here, all right? Alison, she's probably having some fits right about \r\nnow. ",
        "Gabriela: It's sweet how devoted you guys are to each other. I used to have a \r\nrelationship like that with Joe till everything fell apart. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, that's rough. ",
        "Gabriela: Sometimes you think you want to spend your whole life with somebody \r\nuntil you meet someone else who makes you rethink everything. ",
        "Jamal: I've been there. ",
        "Gabriela: Someone who excites you, who shows you there's more to the world \r\nthan you ever imagined. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, well, lucky for me, I know who I want, and she's actually at home \r\nwaiting for me. You know what? I got to jet. Ok? Whoa, Gabby. Whoa, slow your \r\nroll. You're not really inhibited, are you? ",
        "Gabriela: I'm sorry, I -- having so many brothers, modesty was a luxury in \r\nour house. ",
        "Jamal: All right, what are you doing? ",
        "Gabriela: I'm just getting out of this ripped shirt. Ow! ",
        "Jamal: Right, right. Um -- did you want me to get you a bath towel or robe or \r\nsomething? ",
        "Gabriela: Thank you. It's hanging behind the bathroom door. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, ok. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: just mingle your blood with Jamal's. Infect him the way \r\ninfected you. Then he'll be mine to control. ",
        "Gabriela: Ow! Oh, God! ",
        "Jamal: What's wrong now? ",

        "",
        "Kevin: So just seeing this picture actually scared Judge Kurland to death.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I guess in this case, looks really can kill, huh? What could it \r\nhave been? What could this man have done that was so terrifying -- terrified \r\nthat judge so much? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: God, Dad, my life is so messed up. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, honey, what is it? ",
        "Livvie: It's everything. It's Jack. ",
        "Lucy: What -- what happened? Did you have a fight or something? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. He just walked out on me and wouldn't tell me why. ",
        "Lucy: Well, he must've given you clues, something, huh? ",
        "Livvie: No, he just doesn't want me anymore. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, Jack has walked through hell and high water. He walked through \r\nyour father to be with you. That's the Jack I know. That's Jack. ",
        "Livvie: All I can figure is that he is somehow mad at me. ",
        "Kevin: For what? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, come on. He must've given you an indication, something? ",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe because I've been spending some time with another man, \r\nbut it's no big deal. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- where -- when did that happen? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God, I can't explain. I don't know. Maybe there's just a full \r\nmoon tonight, or I am just going crazy or something. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait, wait, wait. Let's just get to this other man part. When did \r\nit happen? Who is this person? ",
        "Livvie: All right. I love Jack. That hasn't changed. But I've been having \r\nthese thoughts of -- of another man who I hardly even know. That's crazy, right?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Wait -- ok, let's just fill in the blanks, perhaps, ok? ",
        "Livvie: So when Jack walked out on me tonight, I was so hurt. I almost went \r\nto this other man because he makes me feel special, and I don't understand that.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Honey, just try and start from the beginning. ",
        "Livvie: I don't even know where the beginning is. All I know is that I love \r\nJack. But Caleb -- he's in my mind, and I am just -- I'm being torn in two. ",
