        "Kevin becomes angry when Ian asks him to keep his distance from Lucy and Christina until they recover from his hurtful actions. Refusing to make any more sacrifices than he already has, Kevin accuses Ian of trying to get rid of him so that he can more easily take over his life, complete with his wife and daughter. Rafe stops by the bike shop to thank Jamal for everything he did for Alison. He also fills Jamal in on the truce with Caleb. Jamal pumps him for information about the ring, but Rafe doesn't know much. He assumes that it's powerful but doesn't want to know exactly what it can do. When Jamal asks what would happen if one of the good guys got hold of it, Rafe replies that the person probably wouldn't stay good for long. At Rafe's request, Jamal agrees to check in on Alison a little later. Grabbing a paint roller to help out with the renovations, Olivia apologizes to Alison in her own way. When she forgives Alison for perceived sins against her, Alison lets her have it. Unbeknownst to them, Jamal arrives as the argument starts to turn nasty. Caleb acknowledges Jack's role in getting Olivia to the club when he was with the other three vamps. He hires Jack as the band's new manager, but on a probationary status. To the band's delight, Caleb announces that they will be getting back to the music. Hearing about Ricky's problems letting Casey go, Jack advises him to forget about love and just find a low-maintenance girl who won't screw up his life. Overhearing this, Reese tells him off and then storms off. When Frank shows up looking for trouble, Caleb issues a warning, but Frank is determined to challenge his authority. After Caleb throws him out of the club, Frank vows to make someone pay. Hearing someone coming, he springs out of hiding and attacks, unaware that it's Rafe."

        "Kevin: This is a former patient. He wants to get back into therapy. I'm referring him to Dr. Baldwin, so she'll need his records.",
        "Colleen: No problem. It's really nice to see you again.",
        "Kevin: You, too, Colleen.",
        "Ian: Kevin.",
        "[Kevin sighs]",
        "Kevin: I thought you and Lucy had plans.",
        "Ian: There's a couple of things we need to sort out first.",
        "Kevin: Well, I can't imagine what that is. I'm giving Lucy her divorce.",
        "Ian: Yeah, but you have no intention of staying away from her.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, you know, we live in the same town, share a child.",
        "Ian: I know all that, but you got this -- this grudge.",
        "Kevin: Not anymore. I've cleared the way for you two, and I've asked for nothing in return.",
        "Ian: Ok, well, I'm asking for something. And I'm sure you being this new, improved version of yourself, you're not going to fight me on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: So what do I wish for now? Hmm? Maybe not to feel like such a chump for talking to a hunk of metal, huh? But you do actually kind of talk back, now, don't you? Don't you? Hmm? Hmm, hmm, hmm? Come on.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rafe: Good. You're here.",
        "Jamal: Hey, what's up? Yeah, yeah, you know, us vampires have to make a living, too.",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: What's going on?",
        "Rafe: I've just been -- I've been going around the neighborhood picking up some stuff for the gym. Alison and I are going to get it open, you know, finally.",
        "Jamal: Good, good. Finally. What, anything I can do? What do you need?",
        "Rafe: No, no. No, actually, you've done -- you've done plenty. Actually, that's the reason I'm here. I -- I just wanted to -- well, I don't even know how to begin to thank you for everything that you've done for Alison --",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, Rafe, don't even worry about it, man. Come on, dude.",
        "Rafe: No, I have to. I mean, you've really took chances. You did some pretty outrageous stuff to keep her safe from Joshua.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, I guess I've become a pretty amazing liar, huh? I mean, I even had the head vampire buying into my load of stuff.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, you know what? If he hadn't, you wouldn't be sitting here right now.",
        "Jamal: Well, just because Alison and I aren't together, that doesn't mean that that has to go away, ok?",
        "Rafe: You guys have an amazing relationship, you know?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know. You do, too.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: You didn't always think that.",
        "Jamal: Well, you know, I thought that she deserved somebody better.",
        "Rafe: Right -- or someone like you.",
        "Jamal: Exactly. But after a while, it became pretty clear that you weren't going anywhere, and you do love her, so -- oh, I'm just glad everything worked out.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, it's -- it's getting there, you know?",
        "Jamal: Yeah?",
        "Rafe: It's actually -- it's been a little rocky.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, tell me about it. How's that feeling, anyway?",
        "Rafe: Oh, it's better. It's getting -- it's getting better. It's -- I don't know. I guess, you know, things are falling into place. Actually, I had a meeting with Caleb.",
        "Jamal: Oh.",
        "Rafe: We're going to call a truce.",
        "Jamal: How do you -- how does that work?",
        "Rafe: For starters, Alison and I will never have anything to do with Caleb or Livvie ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Livvie, I'm up to my elbows in semi-gloss paint, all right? And I need to get this place ready so that it'll be open.",
        "Livvie: You here alone?",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Livvie: You really are afraid of me.",
        "Alison: Actually, I'm not. I'm just wondering why you're here.",
        "Livvie: Look, I'm -- I'm not really good at this.",
        "Alison: Good at what?",
        "Livvie: Apologizing.",
        "Alison: Excuse me?",
        "Livvie: I came here to say I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Olivia showing up here the other day -- that wasn't by chance, was it, Jack? Hmm. Took some stones. Didn't know you had it in you. You know, I've been looking for a manager for the band. I heard you didn't screw it up too much while I was gone. So if you still want the job, it's yours. You can consider yourself manager on probation.",
        "Jack: Hey, you won't be sorry.",
        "Caleb: I'm never sorry, Jack. But I'm going to keep my eye on you. I understand that you're a businessman now, but I still don't buy this whole vampire love fest just yet. Let's see if you can cut it.",
        "Jack: Is that it?",
        "Caleb: That's all I got for now. Deal?",
        "Jack: Deal.",
        "Caleb: Well, let's let the healing begin.",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Caleb: Caz, Reese, let's do this thing.",
        "Reese: What's going on, Caleb?",
        "Caleb: New manager.",
        "Caz: All right.",
        "Caleb: Also, we let ourselves get a little distracted by Joshua. Everyone did, including me. But he is gone, and we're back. It's going to be all about the music now.",
        "Reese: That's fantastic.",
        "Caleb: Regular lives, regular rehearsals.",
        "Caz: I like the sound of that.",
        "Caleb: Good, I'm glad you do, because we're going to do this thing the way we always wanted.",
        "Caz: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry, Rick, are we keeping you up over there?",
        "Ricky: Sorry, man, I haven't been getting much sleep lately.",
        "Caleb: Well, then fix it, man.",
        "[Caz chuckles]",
        "Caleb: We want to be charged up. We're big right now. We're going to ride this momentum.",
        "Frank: Hello, animals! So when's the party going to start?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I don't have to answer any requests from you. If it has to do with Lucy, she can call me.",
        "Ian: I'm asking you, not Lucy. And I'd like to believe that you're better, but I'm going to need some proof. So in the meantime --",
        "Kevin: In the meantime, what? What, you want me to take a lie detector test?",
        "Ian: No, I'd like to get some honest answers from you.",
        "Kevin: I admit, this is getting old, everyone constantly questioning my motives.",
        "Ian: Lucy's welfare is very important to me.",
        "Kevin: I've given Lucy what she wants for its own sake -- unless you think that an uncontested divorce is not in her best interest. Which begs the question, what could you expect from me beyond that?",
        "Ian: For starters, something a little stronger than mea culpa.",
        "Kevin: Oh, it's blood you want? Well, that's not a surprise. Sorry, that was a low blow.",
        "Ian: Yeah. A few days ago, you were walking around here like a madman, wanting to take my son out of my home.",
        "Kevin: Lucy's home. And I stopped the minute I realized how wrong it was, so now Danny is living with you -- and Lucy, and Christina. My wife, my daughter. You want sacrifices? They don't come much bigger than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Look, I've seen this movie before, all right? It never really pans out that well.",
        "Livvie: I'm serious. I'm trying to apologize here.",
        "Alison: Apologize for which part of my life that you've messed up?",
        "Livvie: I had a heart-to-heart with my father.",
        "Alison: Your father?",
        "Livvie: He made me look at things -- my life, you know, in a whole new way.",
        "Alison: Well, this whole new way of looking at your life -- did it portray you as Mother Teresa?",
        "Livvie: I'm trying to be nice here.",
        "Alison: I can see that, but I can't figure out why.",
        "Livvie: What, hey, I have to have an excuse?",
        "Alison: You usually do. I mean, you're not really that nice unless it services you in some sort of way.",
        "Livvie: Ok, you're right! You're right. I have a totally selfish reason for wanting to put whatever it is we had between us behind us.",
        "Alison: And I'm sure you're going to give me the truth, and nothing but the truth, right? Right after you stab me in the back, is that it?",
        "Livvie: I want to be able to enjoy my life with Caleb.",
        "Alison: Good. So go for it!",
        "Livvie: I want to be able to go to bed at night without wondering how you're going to ruin my life or how I'm going to get back at you. That's it. That's the truth. That is all.",
        "Alison: Ok. Great. Thanks for stopping by. I have a lot of painting to do, ok?",
        "Livvie: So, where do I start?",
        "Alison: You can't really be serious.",
        "Livvie: Come on. Look, I'm trying really hard here. And like I said, this is not easy for me, ok?",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Livvie: I just wanted to help you. And besides, it's probably not a bad idea to be on speaking terms with the owner of the best new gym in Port Charles. Even a vampire could use a workout.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Is he one of yours?",
        "Caleb: Only in the loosest sense of the word. Don't -- don't sweat it. I'll handle it.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Ricky: Hey, Jack, what's up, man? Can I get another beer?",
        "Jack: Yeah. You don't look like you're having too much fun over here.",
        "Ricky: I'm seeing Casey.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa -- what do you mean, you're seeing --",
        "Ricky: I see her everywhere, dude, and I can't handle it. It's burning me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hello, gorgeous.",
        "Stacey: Hey, come on. Don't you even buy a girl a drink anymore?",
        "Frank: Not if I don't have to.",
        "Caleb: What's going on, Frank?",
        "Frank: Oh, what comes unnaturally.",
        "Caleb: What do you say you and I have a little talk?",
        "Frank: Sorry. My dance card's all full, right, Stacey?",
        "Caleb: This isn't going to happen.",
        "Frank: Oh, yeah?",
        "Caleb: Back up. It's not going to happen.",
        "Frank: Who's going to stop us, huh?",
        "Caleb: Powder your nose. You're interrupting my gathering over here. So if you want to feed, take it outside -- out of respect.",
        "Frank: Sorry, I'm all out of respect.",
        "Caleb: You want to rethink that, Frank?",
        "Frank: You're not used to being challenged, are you?",
        "Caleb: You're like this walking time bomb. One mistake after another until finally, you're just going to go boom, aren't you?",
        "Frank: That's not your problem.",
        "Caleb: Hey -- when the mistake challenges me, it becomes my problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Are you finished?",
        "Kevin: I'm not wrong.",
        "Ian: You're not right. I don't want to be Christina's dad. I'm trying to give her some stability, which is something that you haven't been providing lately.",
        "Kevin: Oh, so if I disappear, everyone's life would be that much simpler.",
        "Ian: Doesn't have to be forever.",
        "Kevin: No, just long enough for them to forget about me.",
        "Ian: Long enough for everyone to recover from what you've done to them. And long enough for Lucy not to be afraid of you anymore. And long enough for your daughter to realize which version of her daddy is knocking on her door.",
        "Kevin: Wow. It's never enough for you, is it? I mean, you have my wife, again. You have the family that I pulled together as if by magic.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Kevin: But you think that I would evaporate into thin air just to make your life easier?",
        "Ian: I'm not telling you what to do. But it'd be a selfless gesture by a man who claims to have changed his ways. And who knows? Maybe you'll make believers out of all of us.",
        "Kevin: Well, I've had some revelations lately -- about myself, about the life I've made. But one thing hasn't changed one bit. I don't like you, not even a little. I think Lucy's made a big mistake bringing you, fangs and all, into her home. But you know what? That's not my call to make anymore any more than it is yours to weigh in on my daughter. I know Christina better than you, and I know what's best for her. And I'm fresh out of sacrifices.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Look, Livvie, I don't really know what it is that you want from me.",
        "Livvie: I want a little compassion here.",
        "Alison: Compassion for you?",
        "Livvie: I'm a human being, Alison!",
        "Alison: No, you're not, not anymore. You're a slut who isn't happy if there's anybody in this world who's happier than you.",
        "Livvie: Oh. Boy. You pretend to be little miss perfect, when in reality, you don't have a sincere bone in your body.",
        "Alison: Look, I never pretend to be perfect. I don't. But at least I don't run around hurting people's feelings on purpose.",
        "Livvie: Oh! Poor you! No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. No, not you. You should be sorry for being a manipulating, man-stealing bitch.",
        "Alison: Man-stealing? Ok, you're going to really be sorry that you even came here today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Ahem.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Reese: What do you mean, what?",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, you were all smiles a few minutes ago.",
        "Reese: Yeah, well, maybe I don't feel like smiling. Maybe this friendly girl doesn't feel like being so chummy anymore.",
        "Jack: Reese, I was just trying to make a point to Ricky.",
        "Reese: Well, you made your point. I'm a low-maintenance, overrated, uncomplicated roll in the hay. Love you, too, pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: What is it with you, Frank? You got a death wish? You don't want to fight me, and you know it. You're lost, you got turned. Now you're going to have to be a big boy and deal with it.",
        "Frank: I didn't ask for this, damn it.",
        "Caleb: Life's a bitch, isn't it? But listen, you don't blame me. You don't take it out on anyone else.",
        "Frank: Where -- where am I supposed to go? This used to be my place!",
        "Caleb: The times have changed, my friend. And now you're leaving. What I suggest you do -- you take some time and you reflect upon if you actually belong someplace at all. Ok? Or if this is just the beginning of a long, slow descent into hell. Now, if you choose the latter, I'll be happy to help you get there. Don't drink and drive.",
        "[Caleb sighs]",
        "Jack: Thanks for taking out the trash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Somebody's going to pay for this.",

        "[Frank yells] Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Ian: I saw Kevin. I told him that it would be a good idea if he stayed away from you and Christina for a little while.",
        "Alison: Whoops. Sorry about that.",
        "Rafe: I got a special delivery for you!",
        "Caleb: Back off, Rafe. Back off now."
