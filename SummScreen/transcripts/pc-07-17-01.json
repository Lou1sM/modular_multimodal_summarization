        "Livvie: Why do you guys have a drawing of Caleb? ",
        "Lucy: You -- you know this man? This guy is your mystery date? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. This is the guy I was just telling you and Dad about. But how \r\ndo you know him? ",
        "Kevin: Well, Livvie, it seems your friend is causing quite a stir in town.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Well, how? ",
        "Kevin: By murdering people. ",
        "",
        "Jack: You know, you probably have a lot of questions after seeing me like \r\nthat. ",
        "Alison: Are you a vampire? ",
        "Jack: Not yet. There's different stages. But I'm well on my way to becoming \r\none. ",
        "Alison: No, stop. There's got to be some kind of a mistake. ",
        "Jack: No, you saw the fangs. It's not like I have, like, a bad dentist. ",
        "Alison: But, Jack, zombies and -- and vampires and stuff like that, it just \r\n-- it doesn't exist. It doesn't. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. That's what I thought, too. But not anymore. That kind of evil is \r\nvery much alive right here in Port Charles, right inside me, too. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I'm almost done. ",
        "Gabriela: You can say that again. ",
        "Jamal: What's up with you? ",
        "Gabriela: Nothing. ",
        "Jamal: For a minute there, I thought you were trying to kiss me, and you know \r\nyou don't want to go there. ",
        "Gabriela: Don't be silly. Look, thanks for the help and all, but I think you \r\nshould go now. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Well, look, make sure you just lock up, ok? And don't let anybody \r\nin that you don't know. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, ok. Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: Ok? ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. Bye. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. ",
        "Gabriela: What happened to me? Why couldn't I do it? ",
        "Caleb: Good question. ",
        "Gabriela: Caleb. I am so sorry. ",
        "Caleb: And I am so disappointed in you. Your first big test, and you blew it. \r\nNow what am I going to do with you? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: No, there must be a mistake. No way is Caleb a murderer. ",
        "Kevin: Well, he's a suspect, Livvie. Given that he was the last one seen with \r\none of the victims, that doesn't exactly inspire confidence. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that doesn't prove anything. ",
        "Lucy: I think this Caleb is the guy who came to the lighthouse looking for \r\nyou. ",
        "Livvie: He did? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, he did, and he gave me the heebee-jeebees. I couldn't let him in. \r\nI wouldn't. ",
        "Livvie: Well, there. That proves he's not dangerous. ",
        "Kevin: How? ",
        "Livvie: How? If he were some crazed stalker killer, he would have let himself \r\ninside. I swear to God, he's really very sweet. He's always been a perfect \r\ngentleman with me. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. That's what they always say about serial killers, you know. \r\n\"Perfect gentlemen, they always smile and tell me good morning,\" and meanwhile, \r\nthey're digging up body parts in their back yard. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, I don't think you realize how serious this could be. Now, how \r\ndid you meet this man? ",
        "Livvie: At the river. I was upset, and he came to talk to me, and he actually \r\nmade me feel a lot better. And he said that we had a future together. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, really, what makes you think that this guy is so harmless? ",
        "Livvie: Because if he were going to kill me or hurt me, he would have done it \r\nby now. He's really very sweet. ",
        "Lucy: You're not falling in love with this guy, are you? ",
        "Livvie: No. I -- I love Jack. I just can't get Caleb off of my mind, and that \r\nscares me. ",
        "Kevin: And for good reason. He may have murdered three people, Livvie. He's \r\nnot exactly good relationship material. Do you know what I mean? ",
        "Livvie: Dad, I told you Caleb would never hurt me. ",
        "Kevin: I'm just going to call the police and tell them there's a lunatic \r\nafter my daughter. ",
        "Livvie: And I'm going to tell them that you are overreacting. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait, wait, wait. Livvie, just a minute. Listen to what you just \r\ntold us. Your feelings for this Caleb scare you, and now after everything we've \r\ntold you about what we suspect about him, you are still protecting him, \r\ndefending him. What kind of hold does Caleb have over you? ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Jamal is supplying Jack with blood from the hospital, and that's a \r\nno-no. I gave you specific instructions. ",
        "Gabriela: I understand that. ",
        "Caleb: What part of \"turn him on\" didn't you understand? You just open a vein \r\nand bite. It's hardly rocket science. ",
        "Gabriela: Look, I got Jamal here. I was really looking forward to feeding on \r\nhim, turning him into one of us. ",
        "Caleb: But you didn't. Have you been snacking between meals? ",
        "Gabriela: No, it felt wrong! Look, I swear I will do better next time. ",
        "Caleb: You have so much potential, my sweet. But you're no good to me if you \r\ncan't do what you're told. I don't know -- maybe I made a mistake with you. ",
        "",
        "Alison: This would explain how you came back from the dead and all. I cannot \r\nbelieve that I am saying this. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, try living it. I keep thinking it's some kind of crazy \r\ndream. ",
        "Alison: This would explain where you're getting all of your superman strength \r\nfrom. ",
        "[Jack winces] ",
        "Alison: Jack? Jack, are you all right? Are you? ",
        "Jack: Whatever you're thinking, Alison, believe me, I've already thought \r\nworse. ",
        "Alison: Jack, I think that you are in pain and you're hurt. Look at me. Do \r\nyou know how this happened? ",
        "Jack: It was the night I went camping with Livvie. ",
        "Alison: Oh, right, and she couldn't find you and she was scared. ",
        "Jack: That's when I was attacked. ",
        "Alison: So that would explain why you're sick all the time and why Jamal is \r\nall of a sudden reading all of these vampire books and stuff. He knows, doesn't \r\nhe? Jamal knows about all of this? ",
        "Jack: Well, he kind of found out on his own, by seeing the grave and seeing \r\nme do a few inhuman stunts. ",
        "Alison: I can't believe he wouldn't tell me, like, keep this from me! I could \r\nhave helped you somehow! ",
        "Jack: I asked -- Alison, I asked him to. I didn't want anybody to know. When \r\nthis thing happened, it totally freaked me out. And I was ashamed. And I didn't \r\nthink you could handle this. ",
        "Alison: Jack, I know that everybody thinks that I am some airhead, ok, who \r\nonly thinks about myself and where to get the best manicure from, ok? But I am \r\nnot that girl anymore. Since I have been with Jamal, I've learned how to \r\nsacrifice and really appreciate life, every single drop of it. But mostly, I've \r\nlearned how to fight for my friends and the people that I love. And you are one \r\nof those people. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. It really means a lot that you would stick by me. ",
        "Alison: Ok, but you said earlier that you're becoming a vampire. But, I mean, \r\nyou've got, like, the fangs and the strength and all of that, but you're not one \r\nyet, so maybe there is still hope. ",
        "Jack: Well, I don't officially get my vampire badge until I feed off a living \r\nperson -- ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jack: Until I -- ",
        "Alison: And until you kill someone. ",
        "Jack: And I haven't fed in a while. And I'm hungry as hell. I need to eat \r\nsoon. ",
        "Alison: Ok, Jack, just one question -- are you going to bite me? ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Let me make it up to you. I'll do anything you ask. ",
        "Caleb: You sure you didn't fail deliberately because you knew turning Jamal \r\nwould bring me closer to Olivia? ",
        "Gabriela: No. I admit I want to be the only one. What woman doesn't? But I \r\nunderstand why Olivia is so important to you and to the family you want to \r\nstart. ",
        "Caleb: You get me closer to Olivia and you'll always be one of my favorites.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: I'll help you. Just say you forgive me. ",
        "Caleb: I've always been a sucker for a pretty throat. I'll forgive you this \r\ntime. But if you screw up one more time -- ",
        "Gabriela: Show me you forgive me. Show me. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: All I'm trying to tell you is Caleb is not a bad person, and \r\ncertainly not a murderer. What more do you want from me? ",
        "Kevin: I want you to stay away from him. I want you to run screaming down the \r\nstreet the next time you see his face. ",
        "Livvie: I can't promise you that. ",
        "Kevin: I understand -- he's hypnotic and he's charming, but that's what \r\nserial killers are like. They use their charm to lure their victims into a false \r\nsense of security, and by then, it's too late. ",
        "Livvie: What, you think I'm that gullible? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, wait, wait, wait. Deep breath, everybody, on three -- one, two \r\n-- three. Never mind. Listen, wouldn't it be fair, maybe, if you just stayed \r\naway from the guy until we had a chance to check him out, huh? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not sure I can. ",
        "Kevin: All right, fine. Livvie, I've tried reasoning with you, but it's not \r\nworking. I'm forbidding you from seeing this Caleb. ",
        "Livvie: You can't! ",
        "Kevin: If I have to handcuff you to my side, I will! ",
        "Livvie: Dad, I'm an adult! Remember? I will do what I want! ",
        "Kevin: Do you know what scares me, Livvie? The fact that you're so insistent \r\nabout this man. ",
        "Lucy: You know what time it is? It's a time-out time. Time-out for you. \r\nExcuse us just for a second. ",
        "Kevin: What is with my normally sensible daughter? ",
        "Lucy: Well, what is with you? Doc, this is Psychology 101 -- the more you \r\npull and push her away from the guy, the more you're pushing her right into his \r\narms, and, Doc, the more you're scaring her away from you. ",
        "Kevin: Did I ask for your opinion, Lucy? She's my daughter. I'll handle it.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Ok, fine! ",
        "Kevin: Hey -- ",
        "Lucy: Be a big fat jerk, but you're destroying the relationship you worked so \r\nhard to build with her. ",
        "Kevin: If it means keeping her safe, so be it. ",
        "Lucy: What do you think you're going to do? She said it -- she's an adult, \r\nnot a child. You can't lock her away in some room like Rapunzel. ",
        "Kevin: Well, this situation calls for desperate measures, and I'm taking \r\nthem. ",
        "",
        "Jack: No, Alison, I haven't fed by biting anyone. ",
        "Alison: Ok. But you have been drinking blood, right? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Not one of my better moments, but, yeah. Jamal keeps getting \r\nblood from the blood bank. ",
        "Alison: God, Jack. What you must be going through -- I mean, the fear and the \r\npain? No wonder you've been losing it. ",
        "Jack: I thought I had it under control. And tonight, when I was with Livvie \r\nin bed, the most humiliating thing happened to me. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. You couldn't -- ",
        "Jack: No. No. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Jack: My fangs came out for the first time -- ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Jack: With Livvie. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess that kind of ruins the romance a little bit. Well, did \r\nshe see them? ",
        "Jack: No. No. I got out of there before she saw. But, Alison, Livvie must \r\nhate me right now, and it breaks my heart to keep pushing her away, to see that \r\nlook on her face. It -- ",
        "Alison: Look, Jack, Livvie has been torturing herself trying to figure out \r\nwhat is going on with you. You have to tell her. ",
        "Jack: No. No. No, I'm only going to put her in danger if I do that. ",
        "Alison: From you? But you love her. ",
        "Jack: From Caleb. ",
        "Alison: What does he have to do with it? He's just some whack job that is in \r\n-- has the hots for her. ",
        "Caleb: He's the guy who bit me in the woods. ",
        "Alison: Whoa. The guy who has a crush on Livvie is a vampire? ",
        "Jack: The main guy, and he wants Livvie. ",
        "Alison: You knew about this the entire time? That Caleb is not only creepy \r\nbut he's eternally creepy and you didn't say anything to Livvie? Has being a \r\nvampire made you stupid? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ali? Ah. ",
        "Jamal: \"Jack was freaking out about something. I've gone to find him.\" Well, \r\nhe's probably tripping because I'm late with the blood delivery. Dude's hungry \r\nand -- he's with Ali. ",
        "[Jamal smashes wooden stool]",
        "",
        "Caleb: You again. I'm going to start insisting you wear a bell. ",
        "Michael: Get used to seeing a lot of me. ",
        "Caleb: You're really starting to cramp my style, bro. How'd you find me this \r\ntime? ",
        "Michael: You'll never be far from me, Caleb. I'm going to keep tabs on you, \r\nwhether you like it or not. ",
        "Caleb: Hey, fine. You know, I love an audience. Wait a minute -- shouldn't \r\nyou be on your knees somewhere? ",
        "Michael: I'm not going to let you ruin any more lives, even if I have to \r\nfollow you for the rest of your life. ",
        "Caleb: You controlled me once. Those days are over. I'm finally stronger than \r\nyou. And if you challenge me, I promise you it'll be the biggest mistake of your \r\nlife. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Caleb, Caleb, Caleb, what are you, a serial killer or a Don Juan? ",
        "[Television plays] ",
        "TV Actor: It's just that they're so hypnotic and seductive. That's the mark \r\nof a true vampire. ",
        "[Applause] ",
        "Lucy: Hey, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sorry. I was watching this, earlier. \r\nI was. ",
        "Boy: Lady, I was here first! ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know what? Reading is much better for you. This is bad, bad \r\nfor you. Go! Go find a book. Go get some candy or find your mom. ",
        "TV Actor: Never forget vampires can't force their way in. They must always be \r\ninvited. Remember that to keep safe, my darling Constantina. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. God, could it be true that -- Caleb is a vampire. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Hey. Look, Dad, sorry about what happened before. I know you're only \r\ntrying to look out for me. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'm sorry, too. Listen, Livvie, you need to understand that I \r\nhave personal experience with this kind of thing. And if I'm right, you can't \r\njust be gallivanting around with a neighborhood stalker. ",
        "Livvie: You can't dictate my life. Who I see is my business. Now I'm leaving.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Hey, Victor. You're just in time to help me convince my dad to back \r\noff! ",
        "Victor: Well, it would take a much better man than I, Livvie. Besides, your \r\nfather's already filled me in. ",
        "Kevin: I just found you, Livvie. You're my whole life. And I'm not taking \r\nchances with your safety. ",
        "Livvie: You can't do this. ",
        "Victor: Livvie, it will give us a lot of time to get to know each other \r\nbetter. ",
        "Livvie: You can't lock me up! ",
        "Victor: Livvie, listen to me! This is for your own protection. This man Caleb \r\nattacked a very dear friend of mine who went into cardiac arrest after seeing a \r\npicture of him. ",
        "Livvie: This isn't fair, Dad! ",
        "Kevin: Part of being a father is protecting your children, even when they \r\ndon't want you to. ",
        "Livvie: No, I am leaving, and you can't stop me. ",
        "Kevin: No. You're going with Victor. ",
        "Livvie: What, do you think I've snapped and I don't know my own mind? Is that \r\nthe kind of faith you have in me? ",
        "Kevin: No, Livvie, I think you need your family. That's the only place that \r\nyou'll always be safe. ",

        "",
        "Alison: You have got to tell Livvie what is going on. Ok, Caleb is starting \r\nto pull her strings. She needs to know what she's up against, fangs and all. ",
        "Jack: Telling Livvie will only scare her away. And I'm not losing her. Jamal \r\nand I will figure out a way to get rid of Caleb before he gets to her. ",
        "Alison: What are you so worried about, her being scared of Caleb or of you?\r\n",
        "Jack: Alison, I saw the look on Jamal's face when he found out what I was. \r\nAnd I saw that same look on your face. ",
        "Alison: But, Jack, you have to admit that it's a bit of a shock. ",
        "Jack: I couldn't stand seeing that fear, that disgust in Livvie's eyes. I \r\nlove her way too much. And I'm afraid if she finds out what I am, she's going to \r\nhate me forever. ",
        "Alison: Jack -- Jack, give Livvie some credit. I know that you're scared, but \r\nLivvie loves you. She knows who you are inside. That will not change. ",
        "Jack: We can't do this to her. ",
        "Alison: Caleb is starting to get to her. The only reason why she isn't \r\nturning to him is because of her love for you. Her love is very real. You've got \r\nto believe that. ",
