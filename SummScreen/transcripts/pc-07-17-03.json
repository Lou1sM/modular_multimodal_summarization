        "Ian admits to asking Kevin to stay away from Lucy and Christina. Lucy assures Ian that he is the only man she loves, but she believes that her little girl needs Kevin in her life. When Ian goes out for pizza, Lucy picks up the phone and finds that Christina has called her daddy. At the warehouse, Jamal intervenes in the argument. When Imani shows up to look at the apartment Alison and Rafe have for rent, Jamal shows her around the apartment. Taking the opportunity to listen to Imani's thoughts two more times, he learns that she doesn't want him to find out something about her, and that she doesn't want to disappoint those who are waiting for her. They return to find Alison and Olivia in a full-blown paint fight. Deciding that it's not a good idea to rent from Alison, Imani leaves. When Jamal ends up covered in paint, he yells at them and wishes that they could spend some time in each other's shoes. After he storms out, Alison and Olivia discover that they're actually wearing each other's shoes. Jamal follows Imani. After being attacked by Frank, Rafe gains the upper hand, only to be called off by Caleb. Rafe agrees to let this go but wants Caleb to deal with the problem. Deciding to grant Frank's apparent death wish, Caleb grabs his neck but stops when Olivia begs him not to hurt Frank. Arriving home, Rafe is startled when Alison greets him nastily and vows to get even with \"Little Miss Goody Two Shoes.\""

        "Christina: Can daddy live here again with me, you, and Ian?",
        "Lucy: Well, pumpkin head, that really wouldn't work, not like before, no.",
        "Christina: Why?",
        "Lucy: Well, you know what? That is a very kind of crazy, long story for grownups that I don't -- I think you'd just be bored. So I will tell you one thing, though. That anytime you want to call your daddy or anytime you want to see him, it's ok. You can do that, all right? Right now, it's time for you and your tiger to get into bed. Come on, you got to go join Danny. Deal? Ooh, thank you.",

        "Imani: You know what? I'm so sorry. I can see this is a really bad time.",
        "Alison: No, actually, it's not a bad time. We were just talking. That's my ad, and it's for the apartment that's right next door to mine. I completely forgot.",
        "Livvie: Oh, right next to yours. That's a selling point right there.",
        "Alison: I didn't anticipate anyone coming this soon, so it's actually kind of a mess right now.",
        "Imani: It's -- it's fine. I can come right back. That's cool.",
        "Alison: No. No, no, no, you're here, so that's -- that's awesome. You can take a look at mine if you want. It's the exact same --",

        "Livvie: Around the queen of peroxide, no.",
        "Alison: Ok, I'm not doing this with you again. So if there's nothing else --",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's right. We totally understand each other now. You think you are as pure as the driven snow, and I think you're a bitch. So what do you say I --",
        "Alison: Look, I'm so sick of -- you can just go since you're done.",
        "Livvie: Yeah. You did that deliberately.",
        "Alison: Actually, I didn't. But it's a good idea, and it's funny.",

        "Lucy: Kevin has been in Christina's life from the -- I mean, really, he's the only man she's known.",
        "Ian: I know, and I'm sorry. I apologize. I just -- I'm trying to keep her safe. I'm trying to keep you safe. And I just -- I don't buy the fact that -- that Kevin has turned to this teddy bear overnight. I just don't buy it.",
        "Lucy: I never said I buy it yet, either. I'm just trying to give him the benefit of the doubt because he hasn't really put up any fight against what we've asked him to do. So far, he hasn't.",
        "Ian: No, no, he's given us everything. But he's done a lot of horrible things, and it seems that you've forgiven him for it. So I need to ask you -- somewhere in your heart, you still have a soft spot for doc, don't you?",
        "Lucy: You know what? I know what he's done, and I know that this time this is just another sorry in a long litany of sorries. But it's just a little bit inside me this time, it's -- something maybe just seems different, that's all.",
        "Ian: Different, is it? Different how? I -- just asking you to be honest with yourself. Different how?",
        "Lucy: I think I'm trying to be honest here with myself, so -- ok, it's your turn. You -- you do that. You -- you be honest with me and be honest with yourself.",
        "Ian: About what?",
        "Lucy: About this, about -- do you -- do you have somewhere in that brain of yours some feeling that if doc was himself, that he all of the sudden really, truly became the old doc, that you think I would just run off and fall in love with him again?",
        "Ian: Never occurred to me.",
        "Lucy: Very good, because I -- I love you and only -- only you.",
        "Ian: I like to hear you say that.",
        "Lucy: Remember one time in one of our many, many, many, many discussions, you sort of called me a -- well, you didn't really say I was a tigress. I just like that word for myself. But you said I was very protective of my family?",
        "Ian: I remember.",
        "Lucy: Ok. That's true. I think that's what I'm still doing. I'm very protective of us and of Christina and Danny. And I would never want anything -- what I'm trying to say is, Kevin is here. He's not going anywhere. And he was the first man in her life. So would it be so bad if she had two men in her life -- Kevin and you? You get to tuck her in every night. Would it be so bad?",
        "Ian: I'm not -- I'm not worried about her having two men. I'm -- I just hope he means what he says, that's all.",
        "Lucy: I know. And I'm -- I'm not sure he does, and I don't know if he's changed or not. But I do know that little girl loves him, and I think, in his own way, he really does love her.",
        "Ian: Don't give him free reign.",
        "Lucy: I absolutely know I cannot. I'm just trying to make the best of this whole thing under the circumstances.",
        "Ian: And I'm not helping, am I?",
        "Lucy: No, it's not that. I know this isn't the greatest situation, we don't even have to figure this all out right now, do we? Can we just not think about it for a minute, maybe?",
        "Ian: Ok. Because we have each other. And we've got booze.",
        "[Lucy chuckles]",
        "Ian: And the kids asleep. See?",
        "Lucy: Uh-oh.",
        "Ian: Hmm?",
        "Lucy: We have all that, but we don't have any food. I didn't make it to the store.",
        "Ian: Hmm. I'll go get pizza. Why don't you call them, tell them I'm on my way?",
        "Lucy: You want pizza again?",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: Can we have mushrooms?",
        "Ian: Mushrooms?",
        "Lucy: I like mushrooms. You never -- you never let me have mushrooms.",
        "Ian: I'll get mushrooms.",

        "Jamal: So, Imani, what's up? You ok?",
        "Imani: Yeah, I'm fine.",

        "Imani: You, Jamal -- you keep turning up everywhere I go.",
        "Jamal: Alison and Rafe -- they're my friends, ok? So just relax. I'm not following you or anything. How about this? I'll just -- I won't ever ask you a question ever again. How's that? Except what do you think?",
        "Imani: Think?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, about the apartment?",
        "Imani: I don't know. I'm still thinking. Look, can you just give me a minute, ok?",
        "Jamal: Whatever you need, yeah.",
        "Imani: Thanks.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "Rafe' voice: Got to think about where it comes from. From Caleb. And it got passed down to him by his father and I don't know how many vampire generations before that. So it probably does more harm than good. Anyway, it's gone. As far as I'm concerned, good riddance.",
        "Jamal's voice: But I have it, and I know what it can do. Ok, just one more time. Because I got to know what she's thinking.",
        "Imani's voice: It's the perfect place. Really cute. But no matter what he says, it's not a coincidence he's here. And all the questions he keeps asking me -- why, Jamal? What do you think you know about me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Let me just help you before this escalates, ok? Just let me see if I can't get any paint --",
        "Livvie: Alison, don't touch me or my blouse!",
        "Alison: Well, I'll buy you a new one at the thrift shop you bought it from.",
        "Livvie: No, shut up! You did it on purpose!",
        "Alison: It was an accident.",
        "Livvie: Accident?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Livvie: An accident? Yeah. An accident -- that's right.",

        "Alison: Don't!",
        "Livvie: Oops -- accident. Oh, I'm sorry. Now, that's an accident.",
        "Alison: Look, I'm trying to get this place cleaned up, and I guess accidents do happen, don't they?",
        "Livvie: Oh!",
        "Alison: Sorry about that. It was an accident.",
        "Livvie: It is funny, Alison. It's very funny!",

        "Rafe: He's one of yours, and he attacked me.",
        "Caleb: So what is this, payback?",
        "Rafe: No. We had an agreement -- I take care of my business, you take care of yours.",
        "Caleb: And that's what I'm planning on doing. Do me a favor. Don't stake Frank. I'll handle him.",

        "Caleb: So you're acting like an idiot, Frank.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but he's your idiot, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: Stay out of this, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I tried to, but your boy here decided he'd like to kill me. Doesn't sound like much of a truce to me.",

        "Rafe: Really? What are you going to do when they all lose control, huh? You going to -- you going to take care of it, too, huh?",
        "Caleb: Fine. Fine. You know what? Forget it. Everything's -- the deal's off. Truce is off. I'm going to go back to the way I had it -- my own rules!",
        "Rafe: See how good your word is. Let me tell you this -- you get one slip-up, and that was it.",
        "Caleb: Understood.",

        "Imani: So?",
        "Jamal: So -- um -- I'm hoping you like the place. It's on the second floor. It's soundproof, so it's real quiet. It's well-lighted. Lots of space, as you can see.",
        "Imani: Yeah, and the rent's really not that high.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and my friends, Alison and Rafe -- they own the place and the gym, and they're real cool. They're honest, you know?",
        "Imani: Well, I'm feeling right now like you really wouldn't mind if I moved in.",

        "Lucy: I'm sorry about that.",
        "Ian: What's wrong?",
        "Lucy: That -- that -- that was Kevin. Um -- I guess Christina called him. And I don't know what to do because I think that it's very important for her to be with him, you know? Spend more time with him.",
