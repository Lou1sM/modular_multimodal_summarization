{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Caleb is bewildered by Olivia's complete change of heart about his friendship with Alison. Although he characterizes her newly wholesome appearance as dopey looking, he decides to play along for a nice change of pace. In bed together, Olivia asks to make love like normal people, but Caleb isn't interested in something that they both know is inferior. When he bares his fangs, Olivia freaks out and flees the loft. Not understanding why Alison isn't acting at all like herself, Rafe is uncomfortable with her bold attempt to seduce him in the space intended for their future gym. Blaming Olivia for Rafe's reluctance, Alison accuses him of seeing her enemy behind her back. Believing that this uncharacteristic behavior must stem from her time at Joshua's, Rafe tries to call Ian. When Alison orders him to put down the phone, he mistakenly calls her \"Livvie.\" Determined to get her some help, Rafe picks up the phone again. Claiming that she's going upstairs to rest, Alison sneaks out when Rafe's back is turned, and she vows to get even with her sworn enemy. When she runs into Olivia, Alison asks for one good reason not to kill her. Victor tracks down Frank to ask him to go see Mary, but Frank isn't interested in talking to his mother. Victor worries that Frank is preying on mortals, but Frank assures him that his recruiting days are over. Informing Victor that he's the reason Karen ran into the middle of the road, he states that he will never forgive himself for killing the only woman he ever loved. After Imani enters a building, Jamal kicks the door in and finds her preparing to take her place in a church choir. Furious and embarrassed, Imani accuses him of being a stalker and orders him to stay away from her. When she tells him to acknowledge his twisted dark side, Jamal assumes that she knows the truth about him. Imani is shocked to hear him admit to being a vampire."], "Recap Author": "Beth", "Show Title": "Port Charles", "Transcript": ["Rafe: Alison, wait a minute.", "Alison: No, no, don't talk, don't talk.", "Rafe: I just think --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "alison: Shh.

And then I had to walk in on you and frank, and I just saw you were going to hurt poor frank.", "Caleb: \"Poor frank\"?

Come on, let's go.", "Alison: Actually, we've never really needed a bed before. Why don't we get playful and just do it down here? Hmm?", "Rafe: That's enough.", "Alison: What do you mean, that's enough?", "Rafe: I just mean that something's wrong, ok? Something's very wrong.", "Alison: I sort of just wanted to feel you for a little bit. Just your body, anyway. I wanted you to feel something, too, but if you -- you know, you don't want to play, then neither do I.", "Rafe: Ok, wait a second, wait a second. You know that's not true.", "Alison: Well, then what's your problem, rafe?", "Rafe: I want you. My problem is this isn't you!", "Alison: What do you mean?", "Rafe: Maybe you're right.

Come on, healthy, ready to change the world?", "Caleb: Kind of dopey.", "Livvie: Dopey? Honey, I'm comfortable. Besides, this -- this is just perfect. Just me and my guy in our home, in our own little world, just the two of us, sharing a nice, quiet evening together.", "Caleb: I think it's going to take many lifetimes to understand you. You're full of surprises.", "Livvie: Good. I like surprising my guy. Only happy surprises, though, which makes me think of these muffins. Wait till you have a taste of them. Honey, the chocolate chip ones? Now, those are the ones that are worth fighting for.", "Caleb: Speaking of fighting, you and alison were going at it pretty good.", "Livvie: I know, honey. Don't say it. This was definitely the worst one of all.", "Caleb: Well, the worst one's going to be the last one, all right? No me e fights. Rafe and alison are going to stay in their part of town, we're going to stay in ours. Ok?", "Livvie: Ok. So, are you saying you called a truce?", "Caleb: With regards to my friendship with alison -- hell, I got enough frien already.", "Livvie: It's not that I don't understand and appreciate what you're trying to do. It's just I've been thinking, and me telling you who you can and can't be friends with -- now, that's not very fair of me, now, is it?", "Caleb: I don't get it.", "Livvie: Sure you do, sweetie. Ever since we had our little tiff, I've been thinking, and maybe you were right. Maybe I have been a little bit hard on poor alison.", "Caleb: Oh, so now it's \"poor alison\"?", "Livvie: She has been through a lot, you know, and I have to admit, a lot of it was my fault.", "Caleb: What are you saying?", "Livvie: I'm just saying that maybe I should, you know, give her -- give her some more time, some time to change and come around. I'm just hoping that she would accept this, and I'm totally willing to put forth the effort if she is.", "Caleb: You are?", "Livvie: Yeah. Why not? Would that make you happy, sweetie?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "victor: Frank, come home. Your mother's so worried about you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Oh, she is so forgiving, isn't she, victor? I mean, come on, I turned you into a vampire. I turned a lot of people in this town.", "Victor: I'm dealing with it. We all are. We're trying to. I spoke to ian. The are things that we all can do to lead relatively normal lis.S.", "Frank: Not interested.", "Victor: Are you preying on other people, frank?", "Frank: Oh, victor, don't worry. I'm out of the recruiting business. Doesn't take much more than this to keep me going.", "Victor: I'm so sorry about karen. Frank, you've got to move on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frfrank: Move on? How? I killed her, victor. I killed the only woman I ever loved.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Imani, your voic---- it is unbelievable.", "Imani: Don't touch me.", "Jamal: Oh, hey, what?", "Imani: First you glom onto me at work and you're asking me all these questions and you're getting into my private life --", "jamal: Hold on, hold on a second --", "imani: And then you bust through this door and you're covered in paint, anyou expect me to just forget everything and just lap up your compliments?", "Jamal: Look, I tried to explain it to you earlier.", "Imani: Oh, yeah, you tried. But I'm not buying it. I never asked you to worry about me, jamal. In fact, you don't know me. And if you did, you would know that I don't need any of your help. And I didn't even ask for it. Did I ask for it? No, I didn't ask for your help, did I?", "Jamal: No, no, you didn'T. No.", "Imani: No, and you know what, if I did need help, you'd be the last person I would come to because, you know what, you're a sick puppy. You are a stalker.", "Jamal: A what?", "Imani: You're a stalker.", "Jamal: Come on, come on --", "imani: I thought you were cute at firs but now that I get to know you, I know that you're not the type of person I would ever want in my life. No way, no how.", "Jamal: But, look, look --", "imani: And don't even come to me with \"this is a misunderstanding.\" I just want you to back out that door and I want you to stay away from me. Do you understand me I want you to stay away from me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: You want to give alison a second chance or a third chance, as many chances as you want, be my guest.", "Livvie: Well, it's only right. She really hasn't done any harm. You agree, don't you?", "Caleb: Yeah. She and I want to take a walk at sunset, you wouldn't have a problem with that? You wouldn't be maybe -- oh, I don't know -- jealous?", "Livvie: No, ablutely not. It would be totally awesome. I just -- you and alison have never given me a reason to ever be jealous.", "Caleb: Oh, what the hell, I'll play along, at least for one night. It might be a nice change of pace. Come here.", "Livvie: Make love to me.", "Caleb: Are you sure we don't have a P.T.A. Meeting or something to go to?", "Livvie: Now. Right now.", "Caleb: Whatever you say, sweetheart.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: You want that witch, don't you?", "Rafe: What are you talking about?", "Alison: Don't give me that. You know what I'm talking about.", "Rafe: Me and livvie, right? Me on.", "Alison: Well, you married her, didn't you?", "Rafe: Ok, she tricked me into it. You know that.", "Alison: Well, maybe the whole trick is just on me. Maybe you actually liked it.", "Rafe: You know what, this is crazy.", "Alison: Is it really?", "Rafe: Ok, that's it. Forget it.", "Alison: No, tell me, rafe. I want to know.", "Rafe: Just stop, all right? Just stop. If this is a joke, please stop! And if it's not, I'm telling you, there's something very wrong with you.", "Alison: Yes, there is something very wrong with me because every single time I turn around, livvie's face is in my face.", "Rafe: All right, calm down. Calm down.", "Alison: I n'n't calm down! It's the same rerun on eve single channel. They got old livvie over there going, \"poor me, I don't know, it's just -- I don't know, it couldn't be me,\" and you buy into it, like, every single time.", "Rafe: Please look at me.", "Alison: Rafe --", "rafe: Look at me for a second, right here.", "Alison: How long have you been seeing her behind my back? I saw you on the docks the other day and you were with her and you never -- you never told me what you were doing.", "Rafe: I --", "alison: Well, what was it? I mean, I kept trying to talk to you and --", "rafe: What are you talking about?", "Alison: You just kept on pushing me away. I'm sitting there, like, pouring my heart out to caleb and you say nothing, and I never even questioned you. I never questioned whayoyou were doing. How stupid am I?", "Rafe: What are you doing? What are you talking about?", "Alison: Nothing. I want to know what's going on.", "Rafe: Nothing!", "Alison: You're lying to me.", "Rafe: Ok, ok, that's it.

Put down the damned phone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Victor: Frank, what happened to karen was an accident.", "Frank: Oh, oh --", "victor: It was a terrible, tragic accident.", "Frank: You're wrong.
