        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: What -- what happened? ",
        "Lucy: Wait. So, wait, are you dizzy? Are you sure you're ok? ",
        "Kevin: I'm fine, I'm fine. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Jack, what the heck are you doing? ",
        "Jamal: Look, he was just stressing over Livvie, ok? When Kevin grabbed him, \r\nhe -- ",
        "Jack: He shouldn't have done that. But sorry I lost it on you. ",
        "Kevin: Lost it on me? You knocked me across the room! ",
        "Jack: I said I was trying to get Livvie and I still am. ",
        "Kevin: Just who the hell do you think you are? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, stop. Please, just wait a minute. ",
        "Jack: I told you, you don't want to mess with me. ",
        "Jamal: Look, all right. Just -- just chill. Just chill, just cool down. ",
        "Alison: Ok, all right. The important thing is keeping Livvie safe now, ok?\r\n",
        "Jack: That's what I'm trying to do. ",
        "Kevin: She's safe right here. ",
        "Jack: No, she's not safe. Caleb can get to her no matter who's guarding that \r\ndoor. ",
        "Kevin: Right, because Caleb is a vampire. ",
        "Jack: Yes! I know this is hard to believe. Ok, and I wish I could explain \r\nthis -- ",
        "Kevin: Explain? As if there's an explanation! ",
        "Jack: The point is Livvie's in danger, right this minute. ",
        "Lucy: So you think the lighthouse would be better for her, is that it? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please, don't encourage this. ",
        "Jack: But Caleb can't get to her in someone's home. ",
        "Jamal: But he can at a hospital. Any kind of public building. ",
        "Kevin: Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? ",
        "Jack: That's why we had to tell Livvie what Caleb is. ",
        "Kevin: We are not telling her anything. ",
        "Jack: Then I'll do it myself. I'll go get Livvie, and then I'm going to take \r\nher away. ",
        "Kevin: Over my dead body. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Dr. Collins actually has his daughter locked up in one of our rooms?\r\n",
        "Deneice: With his father watching over her. That's the rumor. ",
        "Chris: And she's not sick? ",
        "Deneice: Not as far as I know. ",
        "Chris: It's got to be Jack. ",
        "Man: Dr. Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: Bob, hey. ",
        "Bob: I got the results on the tests you asked -- ",
        "Chris: Oh, no, no. Not here. ",
        "Chris: Ok, what do we got? ",
        "Bob: I compared the sample of Abe Kurland's blood with your brother's, just \r\nlike you asked. ",
        "Chris: And? ",
        "Bob: There is an unidentifiable element in both samples. ",
        "Chris: Are you sure? ",
        "Bob: My lab work's pretty thorough. ",
        "Chris: And this element, is this what's responsible for their superhuman \r\nstrength? ",
        "Bob: Well, it's hard to say, and I'd have to run several more tests, and for \r\nthat I'd need more blood. ",
        "Chris: Oh, no. ",
        "Bob: That a problem? ",
        "Chris: Well -- yeah. I mean, the old man's six feet under, and Jack isn't \r\nvery cooperative. ",
        "Bob: Too bad. ",
        "Chris: No, no. Wait, wait, wait. I'll figure something out. I have to figure \r\nsomething out. I mean, if we can bottle this, we'll make millions upon millions \r\nof dollars. ",
        "",
        "Karen: Hey. What are you doing here? ",
        "Ian: They asked me to cover a shift. ",
        "Karen: And you said yes? ",
        "Ian: That surprises you? ",
        "Karen: Well, it wouldn't have at one time, but now that you have a brand-new \r\nbride at home -- ",
        "Ian: Well, that brand-new bride is happy to be rid of me for the moment. ",
        "Karen: Uh-oh. Lover's spat? ",
        "Ian: Difference of opinion. ",
        "Karen: Well, I'm guessing this isn't over what to name the baby. ",
        "Ian: No, it's not. It's about some guy. ",
        "Karen: A guy? ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. A guy who's taken a liking to Eve. A guy who's moved in with us \r\nand whose twin brother is a madman. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: So this is the famous Eve. ",
        "Eve: What can I do for you, Caleb? ",
        "Caleb: You can invite me in, for starters. ",
        "Eve: What do you want? ",
        "Caleb: I was looking for my brother. A little bird told me he was staying \r\nhere. ",
        "Eve: Well, he's not here right now. But my husband is. ",
        "Caleb: You mean the guy that went tearing out of here a few minutes ago like \r\nhe was late for the fire? ",
        "Eve: He's coming right back. ",
        "Caleb: Ah. I get the feeling I make you nervous. ",
        "Eve: Not in the least. ",
        "Caleb: Good, because I'd like us to be friends. I heard so much about you.\r\n",
        "Eve: Like what? ",
        "Caleb: All good, I hope. ",
        "Eve: Hardly. ",
        "Caleb: Hmm. ",
        "Eve: What are you staring at? ",
        "Caleb: You're expecting a baby. You must be thrilled. ",
        "Eve: I'll tell Michael you stopped by. ",
        "Caleb: It was very nice meeting you, Eve. I hope to see you again very soon.\r\n",
        "Eve: What is it about him? Why do I get the feeling -- ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: It would seem that you're as curious about me as I am about you. ",
        "Eve: I was just making sure that you were gone. Unfortunately, you're not.\r\n",
        "Caleb: Oh. Well, give me a chance here. I'm sure if you got to know me, you'd \r\nfind I'm not the monster my brother makes me out to be. I'm just -- how do they \r\nsay it? Misunderstood? ",
        "Eve: Well, I'm not. And I'd like you to leave. ",
        "Caleb: Just a regular guy with a lot of great qualities. Kids, for instance. \r\nI just love them. ",
        "Eve: I know all about you. I know you desecrated the monastery, and I've seen \r\nwhat you've done to Michael. I'm not afraid of you. ",
        "Caleb: Eve -- Eve -- ",
        "Eve: Let go of me! ",
        "Eve: What is wrong with you? ",
        "Caleb: Where'd you get that necklace? ",
        "Eve: None of your business. ",
        "Caleb: My brother gave it to you, didn't he? Give Michael my compliments. I'm \r\nsorry if I upset you. I'll go now. ",
        "Caleb: So you gave her the family crest to protect her. But I'll figure a \r\nway. ",

        "Gabriela's Voice: You can say that again. ",
        "Gabriela: Why couldn't I do it? Why couldn't I feed on Jamal? Well, I will. \r\nNext time. ",
        "Gabriela: Jamal. Hey. It's Gabriela. I thought I could catch you on your \r\ncell, but I guess not. Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for snapping at \r\nyou earlier. I would explain, but I'd really rather do it in person. So give me \r\na call and let me know when we can get together. I'm at work. Ok. ",
        "Emilio: Hey, sis. Missed you at the family dinner last night. ",
        "Gabriela: I was busy. ",
        "Emilio: Let me guess -- the new guy in your life? ",
        "Gabriela: What I do on my own time is my business. ",
        "Emilio: What's with you, Gabby? You've gone from being this incredible, \r\nloving sister to someone I don't even know anymore. ",
        "Gabriela: I really don't have time for this. ",
        "Emilio: Why are you turning away from us? We're your family. We care about \r\nyou. Was it something we did? Is it something you found out about? ",

        "Karen: Hey, Ian. I'm still waiting to hear the rest of the story. ",
        "Ian: What story's that? ",
        "Karen: About the guy who likes Eve. I mean, he's actually moved in with you \r\nguys? ",
        "Ian: For the moment, yeah. ",
        "Karen: So who is he? ",
        "Ian: The man who married us. ",
        "Karen: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. The priest? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, the priest, but there's something off about him. ",
        "Karen: Off how? ",
        "Ian: I'm not sure. That's why I had him checked out and that's how this whole \r\nargument started. ",
        "Karen: You want to know what I think? ",
        "Ian: I really don't. ",
        "Karen: I think Eve has every right to be angry. ",
        "Ian: Is that so? ",
        "Karen: Come on, Father Michael is her friend. I mean -- and for you to be \r\njealous -- ",
        "Ian: Jealous? Who's -- I'm not jealous. ",
        "Karen: Aren't you? ",
        "Ian: No. I'm concerned. He gave her his family crest for protection. ",
        "Karen: And that's why you're upset. ",
        "Ian: That and I don't like the way he looks at her. ",
        "Karen: Come on, Ian. The guy's a priest. I mean, I seriously doubt that he \r\nhas the hots for a newly married expectant mother, who I know, as her best \r\nfriend, is very much in love with her husband. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? ",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Ian: You think I'm just being an idiot? ",
        "Karen: I think you should go home, make up with Eve, and put all this behind \r\nyou. ",
        "Ian: I can't. I'm working. ",
        "Karen: You know, it's kind of slow right now. We can handle it. ",

        "Kevin: I'm going to say this one last time -- stay away from my daughter. ",
        "Jack: You want me to stay away? Fine. I'll stay away. Only if you promise me \r\nyou'll take her home and tell her about Caleb. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I'm going to do that right away. Sure. \"Livvie, I'm sorry to tell \r\nyou, but there's a vampire on the loose and he's after you.\" ",

        "Lucy: Yes, Doc, that's a good idea. You get to take Livvie home, and Jack \r\njust gets to tell her. What have you got to lose? ",
        "Kevin: What I have to lose is my daughter to a serial killer, not Count \r\nDracula. Now, she stays where she is and that's final. ",
