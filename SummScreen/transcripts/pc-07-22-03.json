        "Ricky becomes angry when he finds Frank mourning at Karen's grave. In his opinion, Frank's self-destructive behavior is a disgrace to her memory. Frank admits to seeing her loving face at home everywhere he looks, which is why he started sleeping at the cemetery. Stating that Karen is watching Frank, Ricky urges him to stop trying to destroy the only man she truly loved. Casey congratulates Ricky, who is frustrated to see her vanish before his eyes yet again. Alison and Rafe prepare for the grand opening of Body and Soul, their new gym. After assuring Alison that they won't be bothered by their respective enemies anymore, Rafe is annoyed by the unwanted arrival of Caleb and Olivia. After gushing over what her daughter has done with the place, Elizabeth can't keep from insulting her estranged husband's latest \"concubine.\" Alison apologizes to Imani for her behavior the day before and asks whether she's still looking for an apartment, but Imani has already found one. Rafe tells Caleb that the ring is obviously responsible for the personality switch. In spite of what happened, Rafe would prefer that the ring stay where it is--out of Caleb's hands. Alison teases Jamal about his interest in Imani. After witnessing Elizabeth's attempt to convince Caleb that she's doing great without him, Chris informs her that her game needs some work. Elizabeth rewards him for his unwanted input by pouring her martini on the front of his pants. After hearing Imani's thoughts again, Jamal persuades Alison to offer her free membership for a year. Convinced that he knows Imani from somewhere, Rafe approaches Jamal for information about her. After telling Caleb that Imani must be the one using the ring, Olivia sends Imani to look for another Elixir employee. When Imani goes outside, Caleb corners her."

        "Ricky: Hey, hey! Wake up. It's the middle of the day. I said get up, you lousy bum! Frank?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: What am I doing here?",
        "Imani: Jamal? Hmm, that's strange. I could have sworn I saw --",
        "Jamal: I got to stay away from you, girl. You don't need my kind of grief. Nobody does. So, my friend, what shall I wish for now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Not yet. Where's the dustpan?",
        "Rafe: What are you doing? You swept the floor, like, 12 times already.",
        "Alison: I know. I know, I know, I know. But the designer's coming by today, and we need to check on the towels --",
        "Rafe: Hey, hey, wait, wait a second. Put down the broom and talk to me. Are you ok?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I am.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: I'm a little, you know, kind of freaked out about what happened earlier.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Try to forget about it.",
        "Alison: I can't. I switched personalities with Livvie. I could have --",
        "Rafe: But you didn't, you didn't, and she didn't, and it's over.",
        "Alison: Right. I know. For now, it feels. I mean, what if I still have some drugs in my system? You know what I mean?",
        "Rafe: Ok, I thought about that.",
        "Alison: Some of those effects, and --",
        "Rafe: And we had it checked out. They're out of your system, ok?",
        "Alison: Yeah. But, like, what if all of a sudden I freak out or I go crazy while someone's working out here and I -- you know what I mean, though? You know?",
        "Rafe: It's ok. It's ok.",
        "Alison: It's a natural concern.",
        "Rafe: Come here and sit down.",
        "Alison: It wouldn't exactly be good for business.",
        "Rafe: All right.",
        "Alison: Yeah?",
        "Rafe: Whatever happened, however it happened, it doesn't matter now. The deal still stands. Caleb and Livvie stick to their turf and we stick to ours.",
        "Alison: Right, ok.",
        "Caleb: Hey, hey! Open for business?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that's right. Although I didn't figure you for the fitness type, Caleb. I mean, but now that you're here, you should think about a lifetime membership. I mean, since you do live forever, it would be quite a bargain.",
        "Livvie: We're not here to join your stupid little gym.",
        "Caleb: We've got unfinished business to discuss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: As much as I appreciate you stopping by, I don't have any business with either one of you, so please get lost.",
        "Caleb: Oh. You don't want to figure out what happened last night?",
        "Rafe: Why?",
        "Caleb: Why? You're not curious? These two just exchange personalities.",
        "Rafe: You know what? It's over.",
        "Livvie: Well, it's not over for me. Being you is like being trapped in candy land.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sorry. Being inside your head was not exactly a party for me, either.",
        "Rafe: Do you see why it was a good idea for us to keep our distance, huh? You understand that now?",
        "Caleb: I'm perfectly fine with that as soon as we figure out what happened.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I love what you have done with this place. It's fabulous! Well, if it isn't my estranged husband and his little vampire slut.",
        "Livvie: Ha-ha.",
        "Caleb: Elizabeth. It's been a while.",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm, it has. And, you know, I've just been sitting at home, anxiously awaiting your return. We are still married.",
        "Caleb: Hmm.",
        "Elizabeth: Not that that matters to the concubine.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what? This is the last thing we need right now.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: You're right. You're right. I am here, actually, just to help Alison just celebrate this opening. It's going to be fabulous.",
        "Alison: Thank you. Good. Is your designer friend still coming today?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, sure.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Elizabeth: Yes.",
        "Alison: Ok, ok.",
        "Elizabeth: Actually, you know what? He should be here -- ooh, wow -- any minute. Listen, you know what? His new exercise line has just taken the European collections by storm. I cannot wait for you to meet him. He's one of my oldest friends. He's fabulous.",
        "Alison: Good, good, good.",
        "Livvie: Good, good, good, because I've never heard of him.",
        "Elizabeth: I don't doubt that you haven't. His styles are synonymous with class and culture.",
        "Caleb: This is fascinating, but actually, Rafe and I were having a discussion, Elizabeth.",
        "Rafe: Later. Come on.",
        "Elizabeth: I originally met him when I was in Milan.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. Your mother, she retains that unique way of annoying people.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, mother like daughter, huh?",
        "Alison: We've got business to attend to, ok? And I think that she's just trying to do the best that she can, and we're trying to do the best that we can to get things back to normal. Ok? Whatever happened yesterday happened yesterday and we're trying to move forward, ok?",
        "Livvie: But --",
        "Caleb: Sure. It's ok, Olivia. It's ok.",
        "Alison: And now I'm going to go check on the food, ok?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Check on the muffins.",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok, ok.",
        "Elizabeth: Hi.",
        "Jamal: Hey. Nice. Ali, hey, hey.",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Jamal: I'm feeling your place. This is gorgeous.",
        "Alison: Thanks so much. Thanks for stopping by. I really appreciate it.",
        "Jamal: Oh, no problem. Anything -- you need any help with anything or what? What can I do for you?",
        "Alison: No, no, I'm fine. Actually, I do need a little help, though. The only thing I can't find is the food. Yes, ok. Now I'm ok. Good.",
        "Jamal: Oh. Good, very good.",
        "Imani: Another waiter's bringing the rest of the stuff.",
        "Alison: Ok, good. Thanks.",
        "Imani: Hey, were you at the club earlier?",
        "Jamal: Me? No. No, not me.",
        "Imani: No? I could have sworn that I saw you.",
        "Jamal: No, no. Let me get this. It really looks heavy.",
        "Imani: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: There we go.",
        "Alison: Oh, I wanted to thank you, Imani.",
        "Imani: For what?",
        "Alison: For being so patient with me earlier. I wasn't really being myself, and I just want to apologize because I know I was really rude.",
        "Imani: Oh, come on. There's no need. You don't have to apologize.",
        "Alison: Are you still interested in the apartment?",
        "Imani: You know, I found another place, but thank you.",
        "Alison: That's ok. So, you said that you wanted to do some help -- you wanted to help me do some work.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah",
        "Alison: Well, I think Imani could probably use some, too.",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah? Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Alison: And this thing right over here -- she's really terrific. So, thanks.",
        "Jamal: So --",
        "Imani: Old friends, you and Alison?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. We used to be together, but now we're just friends. We're cool now.",
        "Imani: I think it's really great, you know, to be friends with someone you loved.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Imani: It says a lot for both of you.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, I guess it does, doesn't it?",
        "Imani: It was you I saw earlier, outside the restaurant, right?",
        "Jamal: You know what? It might have been me. I walk by there a lot. I got a lot of --",
        "Imani: So why didn't you come in?",
        "Jamal: I was actually on my way to the gym. I just didn't want to be late.",
        "Imani: I see. Well, if you ever want to get that smoothie --",
        "Jamal: I will hit you up, most definitely. You know what? Excuse me for a second.",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth, I heard enough, all right? You still here?",
        "Caleb: Hey, I love the place, man. I'm actually -- I'm thinking about taking you up on that membership.",
        "Rafe: Right, in other words, you're going to stay here until we hash out what happened with Alison and Livvie, right?",
        "Caleb: How about you humor me for old time's sake.",
        "Rafe: Ok, I'll humor you. I had a feeling from the second you got here, and now I know it's true.",
        "Caleb: What's true?",
        "Rafe: There's only one thing that could be powerful enough to cause this much trouble and have you sniffing around after it. The ring. That's what this is all about, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Get lost, Garza.",
        "Ricky: I'm here to visit a friend. What are you doing?",
        "Frank: I don't have to explain myself to you, drummer boy.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, right. You don't have to explain yourself to me. You don't have to explain yourself to anybody, Scanlon. Just keep doing what you're doing. It's working out fine for you, isn't it?",
        "Frank: What would you know?",
        "Ricky: I know that you brought nothing but misery to Karen's life, and you sitting here crying on her grave -- you hypocrite.",
        "Frank: Shut your mouth.",
        "Ricky: What, are you going to bite me, Frank, huh? Go ahead. I can't fight you, with your fangs and your vampire mojo that I used to think was so cool.",
        "Frank: What do you want? For me to say I'm sorry? Yeah, I am sorry. If that could be me in the ground, I would trade places in a heartbeat. That's how sorry I am.",
        "Ricky: I feel sorry for Karen, for wasting her time on the likes of you, but you know what? Whatever, because she's dead and me fighting with you is not going to bring her back, but I tell you this -- I would make that trade in a heartbeat. You for her. I'd trade a thousand of you for one of her!",
        "Frank: Yeah, whatever. You take your time, Garza. I won't bother you.",
        "Ricky: Wait a minute.",
        "Frank: What, you got more to say to me?",
        "Ricky: I heard about you almost asking Caleb to do you in.",
        "Frank: Yeah. So?",
        "Ricky: What exactly is that going to accomplish?",
        "Frank: None of your business.",
        "Ricky: I don't care what happens to you, but for some crazy reason, Karen did. And you acting the way you are now, you're nothing but a disgrace to her memory.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: So, you think the ring's behind this?",
        "Rafe: Well, it makes sense to me.",
        "Caleb: But you don't even know what it does.",
        "Rafe: I don't have to.",
        "Caleb: It's a possibility that someone got possession of the ring and without realizing it, has begun to use it.",
        "Rafe: What powers does it have? Because I'd like to know what we're up against here.",
        "Caleb: Let's put it this way -- if Joshua had known how to use it, you and I wouldn't be standing here right now.",
        "Rafe: You know what? If somebody else has it, fine. Let them keep it, because I'd rather take my chances with them than you.",
        "Alison: I think we're going to start with, probably aerobics at the first of the month, and then we're going to move on to kickboxing, because I think it's important that Rafe, you know, can show off his skills and stuff.",
        "Jamal: Hmm.",
        "Alison: You're not even listening to me.",
        "Jamal: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just admiring your --",
        "Alison: Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Equipment you have here on display.",
        "Alison: Uh-huh. I've seen you staring at her, Ms. Supermodel, Ms. Imani, ever since you walked in.",
        "Jamal: Hmm.",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I like her. But I'm not in a position to be with a woman like her.",
        "Alison: Does she know, you know, about your situation?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I told her that I was a blood brother and everything, and she seemed like she was cool with it, but just --",
        "Alison: Well, then, why are you just standing here looking at her?",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, don't mention it. Don't --",
        "Alison: Why don't you go talk to her. You're so good at it. Do it. I'm going to go get her.",
        "Jamal: No, don't. Don't.",
        "Alison: I'm going --",
        "Jamal: Don't, no, no.",
        "Alison: Please, just for old time's sake. Imani, I have to ask you a question. Jamal was wondering how you made the hors d'oeuvres, the quiche, because they taste so good. And I said that you would tell him. Ok, so tell him. Ow.",
        "Imani: Well, that was smooth.",
        "Jamal: I'm sorry about that. She's -- there's no excuse for her.",
        "Imani: It's cool. It gives me a chance to hang out with you.",
        "Jamal: Ok, I thought we talked about you and me and how it wasn't, you know --",
        "Imani: I'm not talking about a relationship, Jamal, just friends. You know, I don't really make them that easily, and I -- well, it's cool. I understand. I'm sorry.",
        "Elizabeth: Caleb.",
        "Caleb: Elizabeth. Should I be worried about you driving a stake through my heart?",
        "Elizabeth: Do you think you deserve that?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. I would. You know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.",
        "Elizabeth: That's something.",
        "Caleb: So, how are you?",
        "Elizabeth: I've never been better. Actually, that's what Georges keeps saying, you know, my European designer friend that I've gotten back in touch with. He's constantly telling me that I'm exciting and creative. So I guess I'm not only surviving, but without you, I'm thriving.",
        "Caleb: That's great, I'm happy for you, and I wish you luck with everything.",
        "Chris: That went well.",
        "Elizabeth: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: Well, if you're trying to rekindle the flame with your ex, your game needs work.",
        "Imani: So, these new energy drinks are all the rage. This one has ginseng, and they're really -- is something wrong?",
        "Rafe: Oh, no. I'm sorry. Do I know you?",
        "Imani: I guess I just have one of those faces.",
        "Rafe: Right, no, I -- because really got a feeling we've met before.",
        "Imani: You know, I just moved into town, actually, so maybe you know me from Elixir.",
        "Rafe: Hmm, yeah. That must be it.",
        "Imani: Yeah, I have to get some ice. Excuse me.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Caleb: Rafe knows.",
        "Livvie: Really? Damn.",
        "Caleb: It's all right. I'm guessing it's the cause of what happened and finding it are two very different things.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I've been thinking about that.",
        "Caleb: Oh, yeah? What do you got cooking in that pretty head of yours?",
        "Livvie: You told me to tell you if anything strange happened before I morphed into Alison's world, right?",
        "Caleb: Mm-hmm.",
        "Livvie: Well, I was at Elixir and so was that girl, too.",
        "Caleb: Go on.",
        "Livvie: And then I came here to see Alison, and she just happened to show up. But do you think it was just a coincidence?",
        "Caleb: She works at Elixir. I've seen her there. And she just happened to hit town around the time my ring disappeared.",
        "Livvie: Hmm. I guess we found our ring thief.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Thanks, Garza, but I don't need a lecture on how to honor Karen's memory.",
        "Ricky: I knew that she really cared about your sorry ass and that for some odd reason she dumped me to get back with you. Go ahead. Ruin your life by becoming a bigger bloodsucking loser than you already are. But remember this -- Karen is watching you.",
        "Frank: How do you know?",
        "Ricky: Because, Frank, the people who we love never really leave us.",
        "Frank: You know why I started coming here at night?",
        "Ricky: Why?",
        "Frank: I'd be lying at home in bed trying to sleep, and I -- suddenly she'd be there, every corner of the room, smiling, laughing, reaching out to me. Oh, you wouldn't understand.",
        "Ricky: Try me.",
        "Frank: It's killing me, Garza, seeing Karen in all the familiar places and knowing it's all just in my head. But if there was only something I could have done for her.",
        "Ricky: You want to do something for Karen's memory? Just stop trying to destroy the one guy who she truly loved.",
        "Casey: That was almost angelic of you.",
        "Ricky: Casey.",
        "Casey: I'm impressed, Ricky.",
        "Ricky: Don't do that, all right? I mean, flap your wings, give me a heads-up, something.",
        "Casey: You know, you're really not bad at this whole do-gooder thing. I was right about you after all.",
        "Ricky: He sees Karen and I see you. But I really am seeing you.",
        "Casey: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Ricky: Casey? Casey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Oh. I swore I wouldn't use this funky ring again, but I sure wish I knew what Imani was thinking right now.",
        "Imani's voice: One day I'm going to save enough money too join a cool place like this.",
        "Alison: Well, why don't you guys go ahead and just sign up and sign these, and then everything will be good with your membership, ok?",
        "Woman: Thank you very much.",
        "Alison: Thank you so much! I appreciate it.",
        "Jamal: Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Jamal: I -- I need a huge favor.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Chris: You see, I just -- I don't know why I -- I think now that we've shared martinis together I can be open with you.",
        "Elizabeth: I don't recall asking your opinion.",
        "Chris: You're being way too obvious.",
        "Elizabeth: I think you're being rude.",
        "Chris: Hmm. See, the secret is to never let them see you sweat.",
        "Elizabeth: I wasn't trying to do anything. I really do know this designer who's coming here to work with me. I wasn't saying anything for Caleb's benefit.",
        "Chris: Elizabeth, would you please admit it? You were just trying to make an impression on Caleb and it didn't work.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, since you are the expert on impressions -- ah -- oops.",
        "Chris: Well, now you're just wasting good booze.",
        "Alison: Imani, hi.",
        "Imani: Hi.",
        "Alison: I was wanting to talk to you about something. You know, earlier, I had apologized to you, but I still feel really bad.",
        "Imani: You don't have to keep apologizing, honest.",
        "Alison: Well, I want to make it up to you, so I was wondering, how would you like maybe having a free membership to the gym for the next year?",
        "Imani: Wait, that's way too generous.",
        "Alison: Well, I really want to make it up to, and plus, it would be good for my business, you know, having a pretty girl here working out. It would be good for me. So what do you say?",
        "Imani: Well, in that case, yes, thank you.",
        "Alison: Ok, good. Ok, well let me show you around. Let me show you the equipment and stuff so you know what to do and -- we have this stuff up here --",
        "[Jamal chuckles]",
        "Rafe: What's the scoop with the waitress? She says she's new in town.",
        "Jamal: Her name's Imani. She works at Elixir. Hold up, hold up, dude. Did Alison put you up to this?",
        "Rafe: I got a feeling that I've met her before.",
        "Jamal: Ok, so? So what's up?",
        "Rafe: Well, what's up is she shows up in town the same time Caleb's ring vanishes. I'm just wondering if maybe she's the one who has it.",
        "Alison: So then, on your first day when you come to the gym, I'll make sure that one of the instructors shows you all the equipment so you can use it safely, ok?",
        "Imani: Ok, thank you.",
        "Livvie: Excuse me. Hi. I think the other waiter's looking for you.",
        "Imani: Oh. Ok, I better get back to work, but thank you so, so much for this gift.",
        "Alison: You're so welcome!",
        "Imani: Thank you.",
        "Alison: You're welcome, really. Livvie, what do you want?",
        "Livvie: I don't think that's anything for you to worry about. Caleb will take care of everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: Carl, are you here?",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Caleb: Imani -- what a beautiful name, and such an innocent face.",
        "Imani: Look, I'm working. I --",
