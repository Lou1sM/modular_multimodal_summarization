        "Andy Capelli: And you checked all your daughter's usual spots? ",
        "Kevin: Everywhere. There is no sign of her or Jack. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, we told you all of this last night. Nothing has changed, so you \r\ndidn't, obviously, get any leads? ",
        "Andy: There isn't much more we can do at this point. ",
        "Lucy: But she's gone. She has disappeared. Something has happened her. ",
        "Andy: Or she ran off somewhere with her boyfriend. ",
        "Kevin: That isn't what happened! He's done something to her. ",
        "Andy: Look, Kevin, I know you don't like the guy, but there's not much --\r\n",
        "Kevin: Jack Ramsey is dangerous -- more than you can even imagine. You've got \r\nto trust me on that. ",
        "Andy: Ok. I'll put out the word, I'll check with my sources. But, Kevin, as \r\nfar as right now, your daughter hasn't been missing long enough to do anything \r\nmore than that. I'm sorry. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Welcome to our home, Olivia. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Well, good morning, sunshine. ",
        "Jack: What the hell -- ",
        "Chris: Did you sleep well? Because you should have. You had enough \r\ntranquilizer in you to knock a normal person out for about a week. ",
        "Jack: Where am I? ",
        "Chris: Well, it's not the Ritz, but it's also not that rat hole you call an \r\napartment. ",
        "Jack: I have to get out of here. ",
        "Chris: I don't think so. ",
        "Jack: I have to find Livvie. ",
        "Chris: Not anytime soon. ",
        "Jack: Look, I don't need your help. ",
        "Chris: Yeah. That's my bad. I should've told you about that. I rigged this \r\nbad boy with 230 volts. That's what they use to keep wild animals in their \r\ncages. So you're not going anywhere. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Yeah, it's nothing personal, Jack. It's just I had to come up with \r\nsome way to keep you contained. ",
        "Jack: What are you going to do to me? ",
        "Chris: I want to find out where this superhuman strength of yours is coming \r\nfrom. ",
        "Jack: You don't know what you're dealing with. ",
        "Chris: Hmm, not yet, but I'm getting closer. I drew some blood. You \r\ndefinitely have some properties that I've never seen before. ",
        "Jack: Let me out of here! ",
        "Chris: No. ",
        "Jack: Ok. Ok, Chris. What do you say we cut a deal? ",
        "Chris: Well, it's a little late for that, don't you think? ",
        "Jack: You're in the driver's seat here. I can make this thing go a whole lot \r\nfaster. Are you interested? ",
        "Chris: Maybe. ",
        "Jack: Work with me and you'll go down in history. ",
        "Chris: And what exactly does work with you entail? ",
        "Jack: Let me out of here and I'll show you what I am. ",
        "Chris: What guarantee do I have that you're not going to just bolt on me? ",
        "Jack: I help you, you help me. That's the way it works. ",
        "Chris: Well, that doesn't exactly work for me, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Well, I guess I'll have to convince you. ",
        "Chris: How? ",
        "Jack: Hmm. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Hey, Gabby. Hey. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, I wanted to see how your brother was doing. ",
        "Gabriela: There's no change. ",
        "Alison: You know, Gabriela, you could be just a little bit nicer to us. I \r\nmean -- ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I'm sorry, my brother's in the hospital. Forgive me if I'm \r\nnot a bunch of laughs. ",
        "Alison: Look, you're being a little bit -- ",
        "Jamal: No, it's ok, Ali. It's ok. Look, it's been a long night for everybody. \r\nAll right? ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Jamal: The police think that the guy who was stalking you might be the same \r\nguy who attacked Emilio. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I didn't see anybody. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby, but you were the last one to see Emilio. Did he say anything to \r\nyou? ",
        "Gabriela: Like what? ",
        "Jamal: I don't know, like maybe he knew the guy or maybe he was seeing him \r\nsomewhere, was trying to find him? ",
        "Gabriela: Why are you asking me all these questions? ",
        "Jamal: I'm just trying to get a lead on this. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, what are you, a cop now? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ",
        "Gabriela: No, I'm sorry. I guess it's just getting to me -- everything that's \r\nhappening. Emilio and I had a fight before I left. What if I never get a chance \r\nto apologize to my brother? Do you know how awful that would be? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Come on. God. Gabriela, if you are so worried about your brother, \r\nI mean, I would think that you would do something to help catch the guy who did \r\nthis to him. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, don't you think I want to do that? ",
        "Alison: No. As a matter of fact, it almost looks like you're trying to \r\nprotect the creep. Why? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: But you said this is our house. What do you mean? ",
        "Caleb: I planned it with you in mind. I tried to think of the things you \r\nmight like. ",
        "Livvie: But we don't know each other. Not -- not really. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, I got started on things long before we ever met. That's what \r\nhappens when souls are one. Do you like it? ",
        "Livvie: It's amazing. ",
        "Caleb: I thought you might think so. ",
        "Livvie: But how did I get here? The last thing I remember is being on the roof \r\nof my father's lighthouse. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you were very upset and you fainted. Thought it was best to get \r\nyou away from there. I wanted to bring you somewhere away from anything that \r\ncould bother you. ",
        "Livvie: Here. ",
        "Caleb: Where I can take care of you. ",
        "Livvie: Well, my father thinks you're a killer. ",
        "Caleb: He does? ",
        "Livvie: And Jack, he's says -- ",
        "Caleb: What does Jack say about me? ",
        "Livvie: That you're -- you're a vampire. ",
        "Caleb: A vampire? How dramatic. He really said that? ",
        "Livvie: Then it's not true? ",
        "Caleb: People always fear what they don't understand, Olivia. ",
        "Livvie: Is that what it is, then -- fear? ",
        "Caleb: Look at me. Do I look like some kind of monster to you? Have I ever \r\nhurt you? Are you afraid I would ever hurt you? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not afraid. ",
        "Caleb: Good. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Oh, I get it. So now I'm the bad guy here? ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, nobody's saying that. ",
        "Gabriela: She is! I almost got killed myself and now my brother's in there \r\nfighting for his life. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, I know, and it must be hard on you. Is there anybody that has it \r\nin for your family, that's trying to pay you guys back for something? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know, and I wish everyone would stop asking me questions. \r\nThe only thing I care about right now is my brother, so would you please just \r\nleave me alone? ",
        "Jamal: You know, we would, Gabby, but it's not just you and your brother. Ok, \r\nLivvie's missing, and maybe because of the same guy. ",
        "Alison: Look, we think that he might even -- ",
        "Jamal: He's some kind of serial killer or something. ",
        "Gabriela: Livvie? That's what you two are worried about? Well, you know, \r\nyou've got your work cut out for you there. Who knows what he's going to do to \r\nher?",
        "Alison: Ok. Jamal, let's go. Come on. ",
        "Alison: I cannot believe her. When did she get so mean all of a sudden? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, all of a sudden. ",
        "Alison: Forget about it. Let's go. ",

        "Kevin: All right, thanks, Victor. ",
        "Lucy: Nothing? Not one lead? ",
        "Kevin: It's like she vanished into thin air. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc, listen, here, have some chamomile tea. ",
        "Kevin: I don't want it. ",
        "Lucy: You need something in your stomach. You haven't eaten in a -- ",
        "Kevin: I said I don't want it. The only thing I'm interested in doing is \r\nfinding Livvie. Now, there has to be something that we're missing, a clue -- \r\nsomething. ",
        "Lucy: You're right. Ok. Let's just put our heads together and some clue will \r\ncome to us. We can do this together. ",
        "Kevin: How, with a bulletin board? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, maybe that was a little hokey. But it did help us identify Caleb, \r\nand we figured out that maybe Jack's a vampire. Let's go to the police. Maybe \r\nit's time to go -- ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Lucy: Why not? ",
        "Kevin: They'll think I've lost my mind, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: No, they won't. I'll be there to back you up. ",
        "Kevin: Like they'll believe you more than they would me? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, listen, maybe that's the problem here -- the believability issue. \r\nYou're not trying. And I know it's far-fetched, but maybe if you just tried to \r\nbelieve, then maybe you'd have a chance of getting Livvie back. Otherwise you \r\nmay never -- ",
        "Kevin: What do you want from me, Lucy? I can't just buy into all this \r\nsupernatural stuff the way you do. There has to be a reasonable explanation for \r\nall of this, and if you can't come up with one, then you have no reason to be \r\nhere in the first place. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. You know I love Livvie, too, and that's why I am willing to try \r\nanything. Doc, she's your daughter. Don't you think you owe her at least that -- \r\nto try anything, explore any possibility, no matter how implausible or \r\nimprobable or wacky or crazy or disgusting or -- don't you think you owe it to \r\nher to try? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy? ",
        "Kevin: What if I can't do what you're asking? ",
        "Lucy: I know you can because you love her so much. And because I'm going to \r\nhelp you. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, God, Lucy, when I think about it -- I just hope she's all right.\r\n",
        "",
        "Caleb: I thought you might be hungry. ",
        "Livvie: Do you know everything about me? ",
        "Caleb: Right down to the anchovies. ",
        "Livvie: You've gone through so much trouble for me. Why? ",
        "Caleb: You still don't know, do you? Do you remember what I told you the night \r\nwe first met? ",
        "Livvie: That I was your future. ",
        "Caleb: You're the one I've been looking for. And once I found you, I -- I \r\ncouldn't get you out of my mind. I've dreamt about you -- the smell of your \r\nhair, the touch of your skin. Do you know what that's like, Olivia -- to have \r\nall your thoughts filled with someone? ",
        "Livvie: I haven't been able to stop thinking about you, either. But I don't \r\nunderstand why. I love Jack. I should be with him and my family back in Port \r\nCharles. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, your family? You mean your father? The man who had you locked up?\r\n",
        "Livvie: He was worried about me. ",
        "Caleb: Because of Jack. You weren't very happy when I found you last night. \r\nBecause of Jack. ",
        "Livvie: He's been through a lot. ",
        "Caleb: But he kept all that from you, didn't he? Do you think I would ever do \r\nthat? ",
        "Livvie: I feel like there are things you're keeping from me now. ",
        "Caleb: You have the key to every part of me. All you have to do is open the \r\ndoors and you'll find the answers to everything you want. If you want. ",
        "Livvie: I do. But -- ",
        "Caleb: Then just let go. Just let go of everything. ",
        "Caleb: Let go of the past, let go of the future. Just live in the now. Let \r\nyourself experience all that feels good, all that smells good, all that tastes \r\ngood. ",
        "",
        "Jack: I was scared to let you help me before. That's why I freaked out. But \r\nyou were right. I need you as much as you need me. So just open this door and \r\nthen let's work on this together. ",
        "Chris: Is \"stupid\" written somewhere on my face? ",
        "Jack: I have to find Livvie. ",
        "Chris: Oh, Livvie. It's all about Livvie. What is it with her, anyway? ",
        "Jack: Some guy is after her. ",
        "Chris: Really? Well, welcome to my world, Jack. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Chris: The girl is a flake. One day she's all over you, and the next she's \r\njust plain over you and on to the next guy. ",
        "Jack: Shut the hell up. ",
        "Chris: What, doesn't feel so good, does it, little brother? ",
        "Jack: Shut up before I rip your throat out! ",
        "Chris: Again with the throat thing. What, do you have a neck fetish? ",
        "Jack: Chris, listen to me! Look, you used to care about Livvie. Ok? She's in \r\nbig trouble. ",
        "Chris: I let you out, you promise you'll come back? ",
        "Jack: Anything you want, man. All right, just let me out of here. All right. \r\nAll right, come on. ",
        "Chris: No, wait a minute. I just remembered -- Jack, I'm not that nice of a \r\nguy! ",

        "Lucy: What do you -- what do you have there? What is it? ",
        "Kevin: She looks so happy, doesn't she? You know, Lucy, after everything that \r\nLivvie went through with Rachel, I swore to myself that I'd do whatever I could \r\nto make sure she'd never get hurt again. Now look. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. You know what? Maybe I'm just wrong about this whole thing. Maybe \r\nJack isn't really a vampire and I got my wires crossed and they really are off \r\non some romantic escape. You know, maybe they even eloped. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, that makes me feel better. ",
        "Lucy: Come on, there's got to be something here, like a motel receipt or a \r\nconfirmation order, you know, from an airline. Maybe -- maybe -- any kind of \r\nlittle scrap of paper that -- ",
