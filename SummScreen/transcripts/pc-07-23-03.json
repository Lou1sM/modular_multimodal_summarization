        "Although glad to have signed the divorce papers, Lucy is also sad that things things didn't work out after almost ten years with Kevin. Alison is pleasantly surprised when Kevin asks for a membership application to the gym. After cattily criticizing the decor in the gym and therefore angering Jack, Reese asks for an explanation of his relationship with Alison. Informing Jack that he says nicer things about Alison than he says about her, Reese says that he can make it up to her by handing over the key to his house. Jack reluctantly gives it to her, specifying that they are not living together. He knows he's in trouble when she states that she'll see him \"at home.\" Elizabeth apologizes to Chris for pouring her martini on the front of his pants. Chris firmly believes that Georges is a fictional character she made up for Caleb's benefit, but Elizabeth insists that her European designer friend agreed to design a sports line for the gym. She's upset by the realization that he's probably not going to show up, which will simply humiliate her in front of her daughter. Getting an idea, Chris dashes off without an explanation. Olivia informs Kevin that his return to his former self isn't working for her. She hates seeing him this way, and she urges him to fight for Lucy if he really loves her. Reminding his daughter that he accepts her choices in life, he asks her to return the favor and mind her own business. Hearing her mother mention Chris Ramsey's name, Alison demands to know whether they're sleeping together, and Elizabeth states that she would rather be a nun. When Chris returns in a disguise, he seems to fool everyone but Elizabeth into believing that he's her famous designer friend from Europe. Jamal assures Rafe that Imani doesn't have Caleb's ring, and he doesn't want the slayer to screw things up for him by wrongly accusing her. Outside with Caleb, Imani maintains that she doesn't have his ring, and she doesn't appreciate being called a thief. When Caleb grabs her wrist, Jamal appears and orders him to back off. After Imani goes back inside, Jamal finally admits to both Caleb and Rafe that he has the ring."

        "Ian: All right. Are you ready for the grand opening?",
        "Lucy: I think we're running a little bit late, aren't we?",
        "Ian: Ah, what do I care? Took these guys forever to open the bloody thing, so if we're running a little late, we're running a little late.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You're right.",
        "Ian: What's wrong? You still want to go? You want to stay? What -- what do you want to do? Lucy?",
        "Lucy: Sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Ian: Hi.",
        "Lucy: Hi.",
        "Ian: Still thinking about signing those papers, the divorce papers?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I guess I am a little bit. It was a weird feeling. It's just kind of like it makes it so --",
        "Ian: What? Final? You ok with what you've done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ok. So far, so good. As long as people sign up for more memberships, I'll be --",
        "Kevin: Relax, Alison. It looks like the place is a big hit already.",
        "Alison: Hi, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Got one of those for me?",
        "Alison: Yeah. These are actually just for new members, though.",
        "Kevin: Well, great. Sign me up.",
        "Alison: Ok, cool. Here you go.",
        "Kevin: It really is me --",
        "Alison: Great.",
        "Kevin: The old Kevin.",
        "Alison: That's awesome, and it's so good to see you. And you know everybody, so, you know, just make yourself feel at home.",
        "Kevin: Thanks. Elizabeth. More apologies. Ok, well, here goes.",
        "Livvie: Daddy? Dad? Hi.",
        "Kevin: Livvie. I didn't see you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know. You know what? The return of this nice, sweet, fuzzy, old Kevin -- it's just not working for me, dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Need some help?",
        "Alison: Jack. Hey.",
        "Jack: Yeah, this place looks great. I'm so proud of you.",
        "Alison: Thanks. I'm pretty proud of you, too, Mr. Elixir.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Looks like we have our own new, big responsibilities now, don't we?",
        "Jack: Yep, we've both come a long way, huh?",
        "Alison: Yep, just as long as we don't grow up.",
        "Jack: Hey, come on, we're two of the hottest spots in town. I mean --",
        "Reese: It'd be much cooler if the walls were red and there was better lighting. Hello, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hello, Reese. Jack, thanks for stopping by. I really appreciate it. It means a lot to me.",
        "Jack: Yeah, uh-huh, it's great. Well, that was real nice.",
        "Reese: Yeah, well, it's true, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Look, I know you're still pissed off at me.",
        "Reese: Oh, what, for telling Ricky to find himself a nice, friendly, no- strings girlfriend like you did?",
        "Jack: And I said I'm sorry. All right, but don't take it out on Alison. If you want to leave, there's the door, but I'm staying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry, I can't believe I spilled my drink on your pants.",
        "Chris: Well, I'm still a bit moist, so believe it.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, I guess my head just must have been somewhere else.",
        "Chris: You know, maybe you should stop thinking so much about trying to impress Caleb with these stories of some guy you're supposed to know.",
        "Elizabeth: It's not some guy, ok? It is Georges -- the Georges -- and I promised Alison that he was going to be here.",
        "Chris: Wait, wait, the what?",
        "Elizabeth: Georges. Well, if he were American, it'd be \"George,\" but --",
        "Chris: Ok, never mind, never mind.",
        "Elizabeth: But it's not. It's \"Georges.\"",
        "Chris: Who is he?",
        "Elizabeth: He's only the top designer in Europe right now. Everyone's calling him the new Karl. He's surpassed Donatella, and I have made arrangements with him to -- to design a whole new sports line for the gym here, but I have a feeling he's going to flake on me.",
        "Chris: Oh, so, basically, Georges said yes just to get you off the phone.",
        "Elizabeth: No, I'm sure something important came up. I --",
        "Chris: Oh.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, so just, you know, just break, ok? It's kind of humiliating, and, worse than that, now I'm going to embarrass Alison and --",
        "Chris: What's the big deal? You've done that before.",
        "Elizabeth: You -- it -- oh, you know, it's a disaster. I just -- I had this plan.",
        "Chris: Ok, look, don't look so upset or people are going to think I'm going to hit you or something. They already hate me enough as it is.",
        "Elizabeth: Nobody hates you as much as they're going to hate me.",
        "Chris: Oh, no, I doubt that. Believe me, I have a long-running history. You know something, maybe I can fix this for you.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, how -- you don't even know Georges.",
        "Chris: It doesn't really matter. I think I can help.",
        "Elizabeth: Wait, wait, where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Wait, wait, there is nothing weird about Imani, ok? Look, can we just drop it?",
        "Rafe: So, what, you think it's a coincidence that she shows up in town the same time Caleb's ring disappeared?",
        "Jamal: Rafe, are you out of your mind? Dude, I mean, come on, she does not have it, ok? So what if she's new in town, ok? She has no connection to vampires whatsoever.",
        "Rafe: Hmm, that's funny, I didn't think she did.",
        "Jamal: Besides, besides, you know what, whoever took that ring would've had to have been in the mansion when Joshua died. We both know she couldn't have been there.",
        "Rafe: Well, maybe she got it later.",
        "Jamal: Look, she does not have the ring! Ok, trust me, ok? You're barking up the wrong tree.",
        "Rafe: But if she doesn't have the ring, what are you getting so worked up about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: I already told you, I don't know what you're talking about. And how did you know my name, anyway?",
        "Caleb: We all have our secrets. I have mine, you have yours.",
        "Imani: Well, I swear --",
        "Caleb: You know, I don't know how you got it, but --",
        "Imani: Got what? Do you know that this doesn't make any sense? I have never even met you! But if I'd have known when I first came to town that the great Stephen Clay was such a jerk --",
        "Caleb: Feisty. I like that.",
        "Imani: Look --",
        "Caleb: Let's just say I'm looking for something that belongs to me -- a ring. It was my father's.",
        "Imani: And you lost it?",
        "Caleb: Not exactly.",
        "Imani: But it's -- it's missing.",
        "Caleb: We both know differently.",
        "Imani: No, we don't. I don't know anything about that ring.",
        "Caleb: And I don't believe you!",
        "Imani: I don't care -- where'd you go?",
        "Caleb: I'm right here. Sorry, but you're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I am not sorry I did what I did. I'm glad. I wanted to sign those divorce papers.",
        "Ian: Ok, so then I don't -- I don't --",
        "Lucy: Right. What this is about is just it's sad. I -- I guess I'm just feeling a little bit sad because it is the end of something, and I wanted to do it and I accepted that I have to to move on, and it's the best thing. I know all that. It's just the end of theese little girl dreams that you have when you were in the white dress, you know, and the picket fence. Dreams just have to change.",
        "Ian: Go on.",
        "Lucy: Well, I was -- I was with Kevin for almost 10 years. That's a long time.",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: And I tried really hard to make it work, and it didn't. And I accept that, but it feels like some sort of failure.",
        "Ian: You can't think that way.",
        "Lucy: I know, because it sure isn't making it any easier. That's -- that's the hard part, I think.",
        "Ian: I understand.",
        "Lucy: Do you? You do, don't you?",
        "Ian: I think I do. I will try to, anyway. You know, whatever you and Kevin want to do with Christina, that's up to you. But just know that I know what it's like to lose something that you thought was going to be there forever. We have something. Something good.",
        "Lucy: Something very good. Thank you. I'm kind of glad that we sort of understand each other.",
        "Ian: Ok, all right but understand this -- whatever pain you're feeling, you know you can share that with me, you know, whatever it is. If you want you to be alone, that's fine. If you don't want to go to this party, that's fine. Whatever you want.",
        "Lucy: I want to curl up on the couch with you and stay here.",
        "Ian: All right.",
        "Lucy: No, we can't. We can't. I promised Rafe. I want to be there for my cousin for his celebration, so we have to go.",
        "Ian: Then let's go.",
        "Lucy: Ok. But I'll tell you a little secret. I think in the back of my mind I was thinking this would be a really good time to put the whole divorce thing away for good.",
        "Ian: All right. What's your plan?",
        "Lucy: My plan is we go out together, out there to that celebration, and I get to be with the man I love, and this is the start of the rest of our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Well, don't sugarcoat it, Livvie. What are you really trying to say?",
        "Livvie: It's just I liked you better before. I hate seeing you like this, saying you're sorry all over the place, acting all humble. It's like you've done something wrong.",
        "Kevin: I have done something wrong! I know what I've done. I know how many people I've hurt.",
        "Livvie: You don't have to apologize, dad. So what. They don't like us. They never will. It's like you're trying to impress them.",
        "Kevin: I'm not trying to impress anyone. I'm just trying to make things better for myself. And I was trying to make things better for you by trying to get you to work this thing out with Alison.",
        "Livvie: What I'm trying to say is being nice is overrated. Whatever happened to looking out for number one, dad, embracing the good and bad in all of us? That is the Kevin I related to.",
        "Kevin: What am I, the gipper? Honey, what did being that kind of person ever do for me? What did it ever do for you, for that matter? Nothing. Absolutely nothing, except give you a lot of paranoia, heartache. I'm right, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, yes. Ok, check this out. Elixir, Jack Ramsey, business card.",
        "Reese: Yeah, great. Great.",
        "Jack: Ok, you want to quit shooting looks over at Alison?",
        "Reese: What is it with your relationship with her, anyway?",
        "Jack: We're old friends. She was one of the first people I met when I came to town, Reese. We've been through good times and we've been through bad times together, and she'll always be a part of my life.",
        "Reese: Oh, it's so easy to say, isn't it? The words just tumble right out of your mouth.",
        "Jack: Reese, come on. Hey.",
        "Reese: Well, it's pretty ironic, isn't it? I mean, you've got all these wonderful things to say about Alison. What about me? I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Please don't tell me you're sitting here, getting all upset about this Jacques guy coming.",
        "Elizabeth: Georges, Georges. And, Alison, I -- I don't know what to tell you, honey. He promised. He promised he would come.",
        "Alison: Ok, it's ok. Look, don't get upset. I know that you really meant well, I do, but do you even really know this guy, really well?",
        "Elizabeth: Yes, of course I know him. He probably just got called off, commissioned to do something for Madonna or Oprah or somebody with one name.",
        "Alison: I'm sure. Absolutely. You're totally right, but just calm down, ok? I'm not upset, you're not upset. Just, I beg you, just eat something, please, with so much drinking. Thank you.",
        "Elizabeth: Georges, I'm going to kill you. Stand me up like this in front of everyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What's the matter, Jamal? I mean, if you're keeping something from me --",
        "Jamal: Look, there's nothing the matter, Rafe. I just don't want you screwing things up.",
        "Rafe: Screwing what up?",
        "Jamal: You got yours. Look --",
        "Rafe: What, you and Imani.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello? Hello? I finally found a girl that I like, and it's bad enough she already found out that I'm a vampire.",
        "Rafe: She knows?",
        "Jamal: Yes, yes. But now you want to go and accuse her of taking Caleb's ring? Come on, dude, what is she going to think about that?",
        "Rafe: Never mind. You're right. I'm probably -- I mean, thinking too much. I mean, it's crazy. There's no way she has Caleb's ring.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: That's stupid, right?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, cool. So we're cool then, right? Now maybe you can see her the way I --",
        "Rafe: What is it? What?",
        "Jamal: No, no, nothing, nothing. I can handle it. I'm fine. I'm cool.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Jamal: All right. Looks like Caleb has the same idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: The ring, Imani.",
        "Imani: I already told you, I'm not hiding anything. And I'm not afraid of you.",
        "Caleb: Hmm, maybe you should be.",
        "Imani: Well, maybe you think you're talking to some other girl. I've heard all the stories about Stephen Clay the rock star, Caleb Morley the vampire. Let's just get one thing clear -- I may be new to town, but I'm not a thief.",
        "Caleb: I'm impressed. Knowing what you know, and yet here you are standing up to me.",
        "Imani: Don't you come any closer.",
        "Caleb: Either you're telling the truth or you are a very, very good liar.",
        "Jamal: Hands off, Caleb. You want to talk to Imani, you got to deal with me.",
        "Caleb: Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What do you mean? I always say a lot of nice things about you.",
        "Reese: Yeah, the last time you said something nice was when I was cooking you dinner.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and I remember how good that was. Mm-hmm. Reese, I'm sorry I haven't been there lately. I mean, just -- I've been busy with the club and, you know, all this drama and, you know, it's just -- it's taken up a lot of space.",
        "Reese: That's what it feels like, Jack, like there's just too much space between us.",
        "Jack: Ok, what can I do to make it up to you? Can I buy you some jewelry, a bracelet?",
        "Reese: No. You know what I want. I told you the other day.",
        "Jack: Remind me. I don't --",
        "Reese: A key.",
        "Jack: Right. To the city?",
        "Reese: No, silly, to your house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: This is for Chris, if I can find him -- a lot of help he turned out to be. You -- oh. Hi, honey.",
        "Alison: Oh, thanks a lot, mother. You just said Chris. You don't -- you don't really mean Chris Ramsey, do you?",
        "Elizabeth: Yes.",
        "Alison: Chris Ramsey? Mother, please don tell me you are sleeping with Chris Ramsey.",
        "Elizabeth: Sleeping? Alison, no, I'm --",
        "Alison: Are you?",
        "Elizabeth: no!",
        "Alison: Do you promise?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. Please, I'd rather be a nun.",
        "Alison: Ok, that's a good response.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Uh-uh, Livvie, Livvie. Just tell me the truth.",
        "Livvie: Don't kid yourself, daddy. Things aren't exactly perfect in my life, but at least I'm with the person that I love, which is a little bit more than I can say for -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I know how much you like Lucy, and you miss her, I know.",
        "Kevin: Lucy's moved on, I've moved on.",
        "Livvie: Ugh, stop it! You're doing it again.",
        "Kevin: Doing what?",
        "Livvie: The Kevin I miss would never give up that easy. He would do everything he could to take back what matters most.",
        "Kevin: Things change, people change.",
        "Livvie: Ok, listen to me, dad, if you love her, if you miss her, if you want her in your life, then you've got to fight for her. Come on, you deserve some happiness, too. You can't take back seat to any guy who comes along, especially if it's Ian Thornhart.",
        "Kevin: I think that's all we'll say on that subject for now.",
        "Livvie: No, I'm not done.",
        "Lucy: Hey, do you see Rafe anywhere? We're kind of late. I want him to know that we're here.",
        "Ian: Just what we needed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Come on, Caleb, back off. Thank you.",
        "Caleb: So when did it become a crime to talk to somebody?",
        "Jamal: You know, she doesn't need to be making friends like you.",
        "Imani: It's ok. I can choose my own friends.",
        "Jamal: Imani, you ok or what?",
        "Imani: It's ok. The big, nasty vampire is not going to hurt me. He can't even figure me out. Besides, I don't like being called a thief.",
        "Caleb: Your words, not mine.",
        "Imani: So, Stephen, Caleb -- whatever your name is -- let's get this straight -- I don't know anything about your ring -- not yours, not your father's, nobody's. So you leave me alone.",
        "Jamal: Well, you heard the lady.",
        "Caleb: Huh. Oh, haven't you just become the noble vampire.",
        "Jamal: Caleb, she's a nice girl and she doesn't need any hassle from you for something she didn't even do.",
        "Caleb: And just how would you know what she did or didn't do?",
        "Jamal: How would I know --",
        "Rafe: Caleb, that's close enough.",
        "Caleb: I thought I smelled something. Are you one of her bodyguards, too?",
        "Rafe: Imani -- she's just starting out. Ok, she's getting her life started, she barely knows anybody. Doesn't make any sense that she would have the ring.",
        "Caleb: Huh. You know, I'm beginning to think she is hiding something for you guys to make such a big deal about this. So what is it, fellas? Why don't one of you tell me where the ring I or else I'm going to go in there and I'm going to find our girl, only this time I'm not going to be so charming about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: So, how about that key, then?",
        "Jack: All right, but just because I'm giving the key --",
        "Reese: Doesn't mean we live together. I know.",
        "Jack: Right, it means if I'm working late at the elixir and we want to hook up, you will have a key to my place.",
        "Reese: Got it. Over and out.",
        "Jack: I'm trusting you.",
        "Reese: Ok. But, you know, all of a sudden I don't feel like hanging out in hard-body land anymore.",
        "Jack: Oh, really? You have something else in mind?",
        "Reese: How about we get down to business with this hot, sexy body?",
        "Jack: All right, maybe later.",
        "Reese: Jack --",
        "Jack: No, no, no, look, I'm going to stick around, ok? But you know how to use that, and I will see you there.",
        "Reese: See you at home.",
        "Jack: Home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, wait, you're not leaving already, are you?",
        "Imani: Yeah, yeah, I -- I just get the feeling that everybody knows everybody a little too well around here, and I just --",
        "Alison: Oh --",
        "Alison: No, you should just stay and, you know, mingle with some people.",
        "Imani: Why, so you can play matchmaker?",
        "Alison: Jamal really is a great guy.",
        "Imani: Yeah, I know, I get that. I mean, I would even stay, but --",
        "Chris: [Foreign accent] Yes! George has made it! I am here!",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, the designer's here!",
        "Chris: Yes, look at it. It's beautiful. So many people, so many pitiful lives!",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, my god.",
        "Chris: Oh, yes! Martini! You are not martini, no! Yes, it's over here with the man who love Duran Duran. I love the hair! Kajagoogoo! I need martini, dry and cold. Yes!",
        "Alison: It's great! Imani, the designer's here that -- Imani? Where did you go? You were just right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Come on, now's your chance.",
