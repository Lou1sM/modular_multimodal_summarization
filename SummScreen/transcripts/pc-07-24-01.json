        "Kevin: Answer me! You knew all along what Jack was. You knew that he was --\r\n",
        "Lucy: A vampire. ",
        "Jamal: Hold on. What makes you think I even knew anything about -- ",
        "Kevin: What makes me think? What makes me think? This makes me think! ",
        "Alison: Kevin, that's mine. I just -- I have this, like, rare blood disorder \r\n-- ",
        "Kevin: All right, enough! Enough with the bogus cover stories! Enough with \r\nthe lies! ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Doc. Listen, you two, I know what you're trying to do. I know \r\nyou're trying to protect your friend Jack. But you also have your friend Livvie \r\nto protect. ",
        "Alison: Livvie? What about her? ",
        "Kevin: Jack has her. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Kevin: God knows what he'll do to her now. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, Jack would never hurt her. He loves her more than \r\nanything on -- ",
        "Kevin: You listen to me. Listen -- this thing is a vampire. You're going to \r\ntell me where he is, or help me God, I'm going to beat it out of you! ",
        "",
        "Chris: Oh, God, he's dead. He's really dead. Ok, you're a doctor. Don't \r\npanic. You can get him back. I'll get you back. Ah! Ah! What the hell -- ",
        "Jack: You still think you can take me, Chris? ",
        "Chris: Jack. Jack -- ah! ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Seven days and seven nights. Give me that much and you'll know what it \r\nis to be loved, to be so happy that you'll never want to be anywhere else. We \r\ncould be so good together. All you have to do is say yes. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. No. How can you ask me to do this? You know I love Jack. I could \r\nnever leave him. ",
        "Caleb: Jack means nothing to you! Do you understand me? Nothing! ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Doc, please, wait, let him go. Let him -- let him go. Just take it \r\neasy, Doc. ",
        "Kevin: Take it easy? ",
        "Lucy: Take it easy. ",
        "Kevin: Take it easy? My daughter's in the hands of some monster, and you want \r\nme to take it easy! ",
        "Lucy: I know, ok. Hold on. Please. Jamal, Alison, obviously this is the time \r\nto come forward and tell the truth. Just, please, tell us the truth right now, \r\nplease. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok. Ok, look, it's true. Ok, Jack's -- Jack's kind of a vampire.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Well, what -- what do you mean, \"kind of a vampire?\" ",
        "Kevin: Who the hell cares? Where is my daughter? ",
        "Jamal: Look, we don't know! I swear, we don't, Lucy. ",
        "Alison: Look, we really thought that she was at the lighthouse with you. ",
        "Kevin: All right. All right. Just tell me everything and this time, I mean \r\nfrom the beginning. ",
        "Jamal: All right, look, remember when Jack was missing for a couple of days?\r\n",
        "Lucy: You told us he was out of town. ",
        "Alison: Well, actually, it started when he and Livvie went camping in the \r\nwoods. ",
        "Lucy: In the woods. In the woods. I told you. I knew that. ",
        "Alison: Well, anyways, Livvie got really scared because Jack hadn't come back \r\nyet from gathering all the wood. ",
        "Alison: All of a sudden, he just turns up alive. ",
        "Jamal: Yep, without a scratch on him. ",
        "Lucy: That -- that's incredible. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. You're telling me that Jack died, you buried him, and \r\nthen he came back to life. ",
        "Jamal: That's what happened. ",
        "Kevin: And you didn't find this at all odd? ",
        "Alison: Well, yes -- yes, of course we did. ",
        "Jamal: Of course we did. We were freaking out, but we were just so glad to \r\nsee him. ",
        "Alison: We just thought that maybe we must have buried him alive or \r\nsomething. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait. And Jack didn't have any memory of how in the world he got \r\nout of that grave? ",
        "Jamal: Nope, none. ",
        "Alison: No. But he did start acting very, very weird after that. I mean, he \r\nstarted -- he was, like, hungry all the time. He had this awful temper. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and he had this crazy, insane strength. I mean, it was just \r\nlunatic strength. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I've seen it. ",
        "Jamal: Well, anyways, when I brought back the blood and I thought that that \r\nwas what he needed, it all kind of made a sick kind of sense. ",
        "Alison: And that is the whole story. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, no, not quite. I mean, you're forgetting one very important thing \r\nhere -- Jack had to have been bitten by a vampire, so who? ",
        "Jamal: Caleb. ",
        "Lucy: Caleb. I knew it. Caleb. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Actually, he was trying to kill him, but then Jack fought so \r\nhard that he, you know, drew blood. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. So Caleb's and Jack's blood somehow got mixed together. ",
        "Jamal: But bottom line here is that Caleb's the one that's responsible. Ok? \r\nSo until he's stopped, nobody's safe. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: I don't want to hear any more about Jack! ",
        "Livvie: You're hurting me. ",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just -- I have so much to offer you. I just \r\nwant to give you so much, Olivia. Do you know what it's like to have -- to have \r\ndreamed of something for so long and the thought of it not coming true almost -- \r\nalmost becomes too much to bear? ",
        "Livvie: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: That's how I feel about you. So you'll just have to forgive me if \r\nsometimes my emotions get the best of me. ",
        "Livvie: I know what you want, but you have to understand, for me to leave my \r\nfamily and the people I love -- ",
        "Caleb: These same people have disappointed you time and time again. Olivia? I \r\nknow you have a difficult decision to make. I know because I've -- I've been \r\nwhere you are. I know how hard it is to turn away from all the things you \r\nbelieved in, turn away from the way you thought your life would be. And right \r\nnow, you got to be feeling like you're about to step blindly off some precipice. \r\nBut if you take that step, take that leap of faith, I promise you you'll see \r\nthat you can fly. You'll experience the impossible. And I want to show you that.\r\n",
        "Livvie: I don't know. ",
        "Caleb: Tell me what would make you the most happy no matter how unattainable. \r\nTell me, Olivia, and I will give it to you. ",
        "",
        "[Chris groans] ",
        "Chris: No! You were dead! You were electrocuted! You had no pulse. How can \r\nyou be alive and what is with the fangs? What the hell are you? Something in \r\nyour blood. It's got to be. Something in your blood, it's -- it's not right. \r\nIt's not human. It's almost animal. It's like you've been -- it can't be. ",
        "Jack: Chris, I'm begging you. Please. ",
        "Chris: But what other explanation is there? Coming back from the dead, your \r\nblood is half animal, and you've suddenly grown fangs? But that's crazy. It is \r\ncrazy, isn't it, Jack? I mean, there's no such thing as vampires. But you are \r\none. Back up. ",
        "Jack: Chris, let me -- let me out, and I'll tell you everything, ok? After I \r\nfind Livvie. ",
        "Chris: It all makes sense -- I mean, your superhuman strength, coming back to \r\nlife. I mean, you came back to life. Jack, imagine the possibilities. I mean, if \r\nI could unlock the secret to your vampireness, you know, the immortality, it'd \r\nbe huge. It'd be bigger than discovering the fountain of youth. It'd be the \r\nbiggest thing I've ever dreamed of. Hey, and here -- here I always thought you'd \r\nnever amount to anything. ",
        "Jack: Listen to me -- there's this Caleb guy, the guy who did this to me. He \r\nwants Livvie, and I'm the only one who stands a chance against him. But he -- \r\nbut -- ",
        "Chris: You don't look like you stand a chance against a housefly. ",
        "Jack: I need to feed. I need blood. And you have to get it for me. Please. \r\nPlease, please. ",
        "",
        "Marcela: Out of here already? ",
        "Chris: You bet. I won't be around for a while. I'm going to take some time \r\noff. ",
        "Marcela: Oh? Really? I didn't see your vacation on the schedule. ",
        "Chris: Well, it wasn't planned, but Dr. Quartermaine is cool with it. Adios.\r\n",
        "Marcela: Off to Mexico? ",
        "Chris: Uh, no, not exactly. ",
        "Marcela: Where, then? ",
        "Chris: Well, kind of a secret. ",
        "Marcela: Ooh. Some place fun, I hope. ",
        "Chris: Well, let's just say I'm sure it'll be profitable. ",
        "Marcela: Profitable? ",
        "Chris: Don't miss me too much. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I can't believe you didn't tell us all this before. ",
        "Lucy: No, especially if you knew Caleb was after Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: And now his buddy Jack has her and it might be too late. ",
        "Alison: No, but it's not like that. ",
        "Kevin: Not like what? ",
        "Jamal: Easy, easy. We tried to tell you before -- he's not like Caleb. He's \r\nnot a full-blown vampire. ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean by that? ",
        "Jamal: Well, he hasn't actually fed on a living person yet. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, he hasn't killed. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, fine, but from what I know about vampires, that could eventually \r\nchange. ",
        "Kevin: Then why else would Jack take her? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I know a couple of weeks ago that he thought it would be a good \r\nidea to actually get Livvie out of town just to get her away from Caleb. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, but, see, this doesn't make any sense either because they \r\nchanged their minds at the last -- I mean -- I mean, we're all so tight and \r\neverything, like -- like they would have said something if they were going to \r\njust take off like that. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but they did last time. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: What are you saying? ",
        "Alison: Just that it's not like them at all to just leave without even saying \r\na word. ",
        "Jamal: I just thought of something. ",
        "Lucy: What? What did you think of? ",
        "Jamal: He didn't take his blood. ",
        "Kevin: So? ",
        "Jamal: It means something's wrong. I mean, he's got to be feeding hard core \r\nright now. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you suggesting that Jack and Livvie \r\nmay not even be together? ",
        "Jamal: Well, if they are, then they had to have been probably taken against \r\ntheir will because Jack -- he never, ever would've left his stash behind this \r\nlong. ",
        "Alison: No, because he gets really, really sick without it. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, he's in, like, so much pain and he gets so hungry that he can -- \r\nhe can barely even think straight. ",
        "Kevin: All right. Would he get hungry enough to feed on Livvie? ",
        "Jamal: No way, no. ",
        "Alison: No, Dr. Collins, no. He would never do that. He loves Livvie. He \r\nwould never do that. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I'd be more worried about Caleb right about now. ",
        "Alison: He's really obsessed. He wants to make her his bride. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and actually kind of turn her into what he is. ",
        "Kevin: All right. Do you have any idea where they might be right now? ",
        "Alison: I do know of a couple of places that they used to hang out. ",
        "Kevin: All right, we'll start there. Lucy, start at the blood banks. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'll go to G.H. right now. ",
        "Kevin: See if anybody's seen Jack -- ok. ",

        "Caleb: Tell me what you want more than anything else. ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. ",
        "Caleb: I think you do. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. If -- if I did, if I told you -- ",
        "Caleb: What? ",
        "Livvie: Never mind. You couldn't do anything to make it come true. No one \r\ncan. ",
        "Caleb: I can do anything. You just have to trust me. ",
        "Livvie: I'll tell you one thing I always wanted -- a normal family, the kind \r\nthat sticks together and takes care of each other. ",
        "Caleb: I've always wanted the same thing -- to feel like you're part of \r\nsomething, feel that kind of love. But you know we could have that together, you \r\nand me. Neither of us has to be lonely ever again. Just give me a week. Let me \r\nshow you. ",
        "Livvie: But how can a week change anything? ",
        "Caleb: Lives can be changed in a moment, in the span of one kiss. ",
        "Caleb: Just be brave, Olivia. Just let go of everything but this moment. Let \r\ngo, and tell me everything you want. ",

        "Lucy: Um, listen, you don't happen to know a Jack Ramsey, do you? ",
        "Marcela: Not well, but I have seen him around. ",
        "Lucy: You have? Today? ",
        "Marcela: No, but I did see his brother. ",
        "Lucy: Chris? Oh, where might he be? You know, he could help me. ",
        "Marcela: You just missed him, and he won't be back for a while. ",
        "Lucy: What does that mean? ",
        "Marcela: He's taking some time off. A vacation I guess, although, he wouldn't \r\nsay where he was going. ",
        "Lucy: That is kind of strange, huh? ",
        "Marcela: And sudden. He didn't even work his shift today. ",
        "Lucy: Oh -- but he was actually here. ",
        "Marcela: Well, just to see Dr. Quartermaine and stop off at the blood bank.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Did you just say the blood bank? ",
        "Marcela: Yeah. Why? ",
        "Lucy: No reason. ",
        "Marcela: Anyway, if I see Jack, I'll let you know. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks so much, Marcela. Thank you. Ok. He's here, he's gone. He \r\nleaves. Blood bank. I'm sure he wasn't making a deposit. Got to be Jack. ",

        "Chris: Rise and shine, Nosferatu. Lunch is served. ",
        "Jack: Give it to me. Give it to me. ",
        "Chris: Now, now, now. Don't get greedy. No reason we can't be civilized about \r\nthis. ",
        "Jack: Oh, I need more. More. ",
        "Chris: Um -- no can do. Well, if we're going to work together, I have to be \r\nable to handle you, and something tells me if you get a little too much of that \r\njuice running through your veins, then look out. ",
        "Jack: I can't live on what you got me. ",
        "Chris: Jack, I'm a doctor. You can trust me. I'll give you just enough to \r\nkeep that precious vampire blood of yours pumping. ",

        "",
        "Kevin: Livvie followed Caleb to a place like this? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, she tried to fight it as much as she could, but she \r\nreally just couldn't. ",
        "Jamal: Truth is, Dr. Collins, Livvie would probably follow him anywhere. ",

        "Alison: Yeah. It's kind of creepy, isn't it? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. It's all right, baby. Look, if Livvie is here, Caleb can't hurt \r\nus. ",
        "Kevin: Why do you say that? ",
        "Jamal: Because he can't kill in front of someone that he loves. ",
        "Kevin: \"Love.\" ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Funny way to think of it -- turn someone into an evil version of \r\nyourself. ",
        "Alison: Look, we will find them, ok? ",
        "Kevin: How? We don't even know where Livvie is. ",
        "Jamal: Well, let's just look around. I mean, maybe he left something. Maybe \r\nshe left something that'll lead us to her. I don't know. ",

        "Jamal and Alison: What? ",

        "Livvie: I wanted that family with Jack. ",

        "Kevin: Do you think that Chris has Jack? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, Doc, I'd bet the farm on it. The question is, where? ",
