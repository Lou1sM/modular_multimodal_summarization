        "Gabriela: I know you need more than they gave you after everything I took. I \r\njust hope it helps. I don't understand. You're my brother, Emilio. He said I \r\ncouldn't do this to a member of my own family. ",
        "Karen: Hey, Gabby, hi. ",
        "Gabriela: Karen. ",
        "Karen: How's he -- what's going on? I didn't order another unit of blood for \r\nhim. ",
        "Gabriela: You didn't? I could've -- Karen, please -- ",
        "Karen: He doesn't need it. ",
        "Gabriela: It won't hurt him, will it? I'm sorry if I misread the chart. ",
        "Karen: That's ok, Gabby. I'm sure this is hard on you. ",
        "Gabriela: More than you know. ",
        "Karen: Listen, why don't you take a break, and I'll sit with him. ",
        "Gabriela: Are you sure? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. ",
        "Gabriela: All right, well, maybe just a few minutes. Thanks. ",
        "Eve: Gabby, hi. ",
        "Ian: We just heard. Sorry. ",
        "Karen: Thanks for getting here so quickly. I asked them in for a second \r\nopinion. Why don't you take your break? ",
        "Gabriela: No, that's all right. I'll just -- ",
        "Ian: Nah -- you've been here all night. Might as well go. We'll let you know \r\nif anything changes. ",
        "Eve: He's in good hands, Gabby. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. Thanks. ",
        "Ian: Is she ok? ",
        "Karen: Gabby? Well, she's been acting a little strange, but I can't exactly \r\nblame her. ",
        "Eve: So, what, she just walked in and found him lying on the floor in a \r\ncubicle? ",
        "Karen: That's what she said. She left him for a minute. When she came back, \r\nhe had collapsed. ",
        "Ian: And he's been like this ever since? ",
        "Karen: Hasn't moved a muscle. We ran all the standard tests. Other than half \r\nof his blood supply being missing, there's really nothing else wrong with him. \r\nOh, Emilio! ",
        "Eve: My God! ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Caleb has Livvie. I found her clothes in the catacombs. ",
        "Lucy: What? Oh, no! ",
        "Kevin: That has to be where Jack is. He must be looking for them. ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. I don't think so. ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? ",
        "Lucy: Chris Ramsey checked out a six-pack of blood and took a sudden \r\nvacation. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. You think that Chris has Jack? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, Doc, I'd bet the farm on it. The question is where? ",
        "",
        "Chris: Want to trade that empty in for a fresh one, there, Jack? Get your \r\nnickel deposit back? Those cost money! ",
        "Jack: You bastard. ",
        "Chris: And watch your language, or you're going to bed without supper, young \r\nman. ",
        "Jack: Why are you doing this? Revenge, huh? ",
        "Chris: No, see, the truth is, I'm just turning an ordinary lab rat into a \r\ncash cow -- with fangs. Yeah. And it's my duty as a physician to pursue all \r\npossible research. I'm in the business of saving lives, Jack. ",
        "Jack: No. You're in the business of lining your pockets. ",
        "Chris: Well, that's a natural byproduct of saving lives. I've never hurt a \r\nliving soul -- or even a semi-living soul, like yourself. ",
        "Jack: You're killing Livvie by keeping me locked up in here. If I don't get \r\nto Caleb, you might as well be signing her death warrant. Don't you get it? ",
        "Chris: Well, if I didn't before, I do now. ",
        "Jack: What are you going to do? ",
        "Chris: Nothing. ",

        "Livvie: Mom? ",
        "Rachel: It's really me, sweetheart. ",
        "Livvie: I -- no, I can't believe it. ",
        "Caleb: I told you I'd give you what you wanted most. ",
        "Rachel: What? I don't even get a hug, baby? Come on. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, my -- Mom. God, I -- I can't believe it. It's really you. You're \r\nhere. I can't believe it. I've missed you so much. ",

        "Ian: Eve! ",
        "Eve: I'm coming! Hang on. ",
        "Karen: Double the dose. ",
        "Eve: Double? ",
        "Karen: Just do it. ",
        "Ian: Get his legs. ",
        "Karen: Got his legs. I got him. ",
        "Emilio: Go on. ",
        "Ian: Just relax. Eve, now! ",

        "Emilio: Ah, you bitch! I'm your brother, you heartless -- ",
        "Ian: Ok. What just happened here? ",
        "Karen: Let's get him into bed. ",
        "Eve: I'll get the restraints. ",
        "Ian: I got him. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Karen: I'll get the orderly. ",
        "Eve: You got him? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: All right. ",
        "Ian: Here we go. All right. Anybody want to guess what just happened here?\r\n",
        "Eve: Not even. ",
        "Karen: Can you do the restraints, please? ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "Karen: Let's go. ",
        "Eve: I'm coming. Just finish these up, please. Here. ",
        "Eve: Are you ok? ",
        "Ian: Fine. You two? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. Yeah. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, we're all ok. ",
        "Karen: Well, I would've said this was one for the books up until these last \r\nfew weeks. By the way we've been having to tranquilize and restrain certain \r\npeople -- ",
        "Gabriela: Karen -- hey, what's going on? Why's everybody out here? ",
        "Eve: Um -- ",
        "Karen: Well, your brother woke up agitated. ",
        "Ian: Is he on any kind of medication right now? ",
        "Gabriela: Emilio? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Gabriela: No. No, if he had a reaction, it was just because he's been \r\nunconscious for so long. Is he ok now? ",
        "Karen: Well, we had to put him under again. ",
        "Eve: Way under. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh. Well, I'm sure you just did what had to be done. I better go \r\nsit with him. We don't want him waking up scared again. ",
        "Ian: No, we don't want that. ",
        "Gabriela: Thank you for taking an interest. I really appreciate it. ",
        "Karen: Well, that just gets weirder and weirder. ",
        "Ian: What do you mean? ",
        "Karen: A little while ago, when I walked in, I saw Gabby giving Emilio more \r\nunits of blood. ",
        "Ian: What's strange about that? ",
        "Karen: I never ordered it. ",
        "Eve: What? She went over your head? ",
        "Karen: You know, ever since she dumped Joe, she's been acting like a \r\ndifferent person, and it's not only her. ",
        "Ian: What does that mean? ",
        "Karen: Well, first there was Jack Ramsey. We never found out what was wrong \r\nwith him, but at least he got better. Then Judge Kurland showed similar \r\nsymptoms. ",
        "Eve: Well, until we put the pieces together, we'd better keep Emilio under \r\nsedation without slowing down his recovery. ",
        "Karen: Well, what do you think about moving him into lockdown? ",
        "Ian: I think it's a good idea. ",
        "Eve: My God, this is like some sort of epidemic. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: God, I can't believe it. I can't believe you're really here. It's \r\nreally happening. ",
        "Rachel: It's because you wanted it so much, sweetheart. ",
        "Livvie: And somehow Caleb, he -- he knew. ",
        "Rachel: He's the one that brought me to you. ",
        "Livvie: But how is it possible? ",
        "Rachel: Oh. Well, just look at this place, how wonderful it is. Nothing is \r\nimpossible here, Livvie. Nothing. It's a dreamland. It's our paradise -- for us, \r\nfor all of us, all three of us -- Caleb, you, and me. ",
        "Livvie: No, but for how -- how long? How long can you stay? There's still so \r\nmany people out there that want to see you punished. ",
        "Rachel: No. No, nothing can hurt me as long as I'm here. No one would ever \r\nfind me here. Caleb would see to that. ",
        "Livvie: God, you look so beautiful. ",
        "Rachel: I am so happy to see you and to hold you. ",
        "Livvie: God. And healthy? ",
        "Rachel: I am. I'm all better. ",
        "Livvie: You mean you're cured? ",
        "Rachel: Completely, sweetheart. Completely. Now everything can go back to the \r\nway it was, huh? Isn't that what you've wanted for so long? ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yes. Mama, yes. And he knew. Somehow Caleb knows exactly what I \r\nneed and what I want. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Ok, Jack, hate to break up the party, but I have a few questions that \r\nonly a computer can answer, so don't go anywhere, ok? ",
        "Jack: Go to hell. ",
        "Chris: Without you? Wouldn't dream of it. We'll go there together, little \r\nbrother. I mean, what are big brothers for, right? Oh, by the way, you hungry? \r\nI'm going to get you a juicy cheeseburger, maybe a couple of pounds of raw meat. \r\nWash it down with a big, frothy glass of O-negative or something? What's your \r\npleasure? All right. Have it your way. I'll just make it a big, big surprise.\r\n",
        "Jack: I can't do this anymore. I have to eat. I need to get to Livvie. I love \r\nyou so much. Give me strength. ",
        "",
        "Rachel: What is it, Livvie? What's wrong? ",
        "Livvie: I'm afraid. ",
        "Rachel: Of me? ",
        "Livvie: No. I'm afraid that you're not really cured. ",
        "Rachel: Oh, honey, don't be. I am as far from crazy as any mother could be.\r\n",
        "Livvie: So, then, it really is a miracle? ",
        "Rachel: Yes, a miracle. And now this is our time together. ",
        "Livvie: For good? ",
        "Rachel: Forever. And you know what the best part about it is? The thing that \r\nyou've been most frightened of -- this family curse -- it's broken, honey. What \r\nhappened to Grandma and Aunt Grace, what happened to me -- it'll never, never \r\nhappen to you. You'll always have that balanced mind and heart that you have \r\nright now. You believe me, don't you? ",
        "Livvie: Gosh, yes. Ah, yes. You don't know how this feels. There's so much \r\nthat we've missed and so much that I've wanted to tell you. ",
        "Rachel: Tell me. Tell me everything right now. ",
        "Livvie: Do you know that Grandma has a boyfriend? ",
        "Rachel: There. You see. All things are possible. ",
        "Livvie: God, I love you so much, and now that you're back for good, we can --\r\n",
        "Rachel: Well, no, no, not -- not just yet. But soon. It won't be long. ",
        "Livvie: Wait. You mean you're not staying? ",
        "Rachel: Livvie, I'll be back. I'll be back before you know it, and I'll stay \r\nforever. ",
        "Livvie: But when? ",
        "Rachel: Sweetheart, if you want it bad enough, your heart's desire is just \r\naround the corner. We'll be together just like before, thanks to Caleb. ",

        "Lucy: What? You told him? ",
        "Kevin: That we're dealing with vampires? No, I didn't. But if finding Livvie \r\nmeans finding Jack and if Chris has Jack stashed somewhere, maybe Victor can \r\nhelp. ",
        "Lucy: Good. That's a good idea. At least it's a start, huh? ",
        "Kevin: First we find the haystack, and then we search for the needle. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Search. Search. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I've never felt so helpless in all my life. And it's all my \r\nfault because I kept brushing off all your instincts. And now -- I just wish \r\nmore than anything I could crawl inside your head and try and figure out what's \r\ngoing on because now I understand that we're dealing with things I could never \r\nfathom.

        "Kevin: Yeah, you mean the laboratory? ",

        "Kevin: Go with it. Follow the trail. ",
        "Lucy: It's really strange, but it's like it's happening right now. It's like \r\n-- it's like we're there right now. And the feeling is so incredibly strong. ",

That was some of the best blood I've ever tasted, Chris. \r\nWhere'd you get that? Know what? Doesn't matter. But gained my strength back. \r\nGot my appetite back. Great news, huh? ",
