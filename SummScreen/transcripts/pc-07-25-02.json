        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Well, happy belated birthday. ",
        "Alison: Don't say \"birthday.\" ",
        "Jamal: What? Looks like somebody did a little too much celebrating, hmm? ",
        "Alison: Not so much celebrating, but more like anesthetizing. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I heard about what happened between you and Rafe, and I'm sorry. \r\nI know it kind of had to be hard for you to go through all that. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, I've sort of accepted it. Livvie is having Rafe's baby, \r\nand, well, hell, sometimes that's just the way life goes. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, look, you don't have to front for me, ok? I mean, it's ok to feel \r\nbad. Just do me a favor -- try to remember you got a lot of friends here that \r\ncare about you, ok? Don't go shutting everybody out like you did last time. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'll try not to do that. I think that I can use all the friends \r\nI can get right now. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you're looking at one of your best. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. So, are you here alone? Because I was just -- ",
        "Jamal: Oh, well -- ",
        "Alison: Coming in to grab -- ",
        "Marissa: Jamal. There you are. I've been looking all over for you. ",

        "Rafe's Voice: An avatar cannot exist independent. ",
        "Ian's Voice: But it could be anybody? ",
        "Rafe's Voice: It has to find a human body to inhabit. ",
        "Ian's Voice: Its need for power overwhelms its need to do justice. ",
        "Rafe's Voice: Its human qualities are overtaken by the avatar's desire for \r\ncontrol. It can reproduce. ",
        "Ian's Voice: In human form? ",
        "Rafe's Voice: I have no idea. ",

        "Livvie: Damn it. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, Livvie. Get a grip. There's nothing here, ok? There's nothing \r\nhere. Oh! God, it's happening. It's moving again. You're only a few days old. \r\nWhat is happening to me? What is going on? ",

        "Marissa: Sure. ",
        "Alison: Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: So, you take care of yourself, ok? And I meant what I said. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. I'll see you. ",

        "Kate: Oh, hey. ",
        "Alison: I'm so glad to see you. It's good to see you. Can you please just \r\nsmile and pretend like you're here to see me? ",
        "Kate: What? ",
        "Alison: Do you want to sit down already? ",
        "Kate: Oh. Oh, I think I'm beginning to see the problem. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. That's the second time that I've seen her with him. I think -- \r\nI think there's something going on. ",
        "Kate: And it bothers you? ",
        "Alison: No, it doesn't -- it doesn't really bother me. I'm glad that he's \r\ngetting on with his life. It just sort of -- ",
        "Kate: It's weird. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, it is sort of weird. Sort of caught me by surprise, that's all. \r\nI don't know. ",
        "Kate: What's wrong? ",
        "Alison: You know -- oh, I've got the tail end of the worst hangover in the \r\nwhole world. ",
        "Kate: I'm sorry, you? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's kind of my first time. ",
        "Kate: Hopefully your last. ",
        "Alison: Jack got me drunk for my 21st birthday. ",
        "Kate: Nice. The gift that keeps on giving. ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Kate: Well, happy birthday. I'm sorry I missed it. ",
        "Alison: Well, don't be. It was sort of pathetic, really, but Jack and I -- we \r\nlived it up. ",
        "Kate: Oh, so, then it was worth it? ",
        "Alison: I don't feel so good, so I don't know if I'd go that far, but enough \r\nabout me. What's going on? I haven't seen you in a long time. How was your trip?\r\n",
        "Kate: Oh, it was fine. It was fine. But now I have the task of having to find \r\nan apartment. You don't happen to know of anything, do you? ",
        "Alison: Well, why don't you stay with me? ",
        "",
        "Marissa: So, I take it Alison is the ex. Cute. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, she's the ex. ",
        "Marissa: So, who -- ",
        "Jamal: I was, ok? I was the dumper then the dumpee. I had the worst of both \r\nworlds. Happy? That is what you were going to ask, right? ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, there you go. ",
        "Marissa: Well, you don't have to get so defensive about it. ",
        "Jamal: I'm not being defensive about anything. ",
        "Marissa: Ok. Well, why don't we talk about something else? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Good idea. ",
        "Marissa: Oh, you know, I was looking for you because I just saw my mom off \r\nand I wanted to tell you that you were absolutely right. Telling her about Casey \r\nwould have been such a huge mistake. She would have been devastated. She really \r\nliked you. ",
        "Jamal: Your mom? Right. ",
        "Marissa: Don't be so surprised. She said you were a keeper. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, well, that's a first, I'll tell you that. ",
        "Marissa: I really wanted to tell you something, though. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah? What's that? ",
        "Marissa: This whole Casey thing is just -- it's just such a big shock, you \r\nknow? Finding out that I had an identical twin sister who died? It felt like -- \r\nyou know, I was just pretty freaked out. And if it wasn't for you, Jamal -- I \r\njust think that you were really great the way you kind of helped me deal with \r\nall of this, so -- so thank you. ",
        "Jamal: Not a problem. I was just, you know, being a friend. ",
        "Marissa: Still got the jones for her, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Hmm? ",
        "Marissa: Yeah, Alison, the one you keep staring at like I'm not even here. \r\nAlthough if I really wanted to think about it, it's kind of rude, especially \r\nsince I think we're, you know -- ",
        "Jamal: Look, Marissa -- I'm glad that I could help out the situation with you \r\nand your mom and everything, and when my man Ricky gets back, he can tell you as \r\nmuch as you want to know about Casey, ok? I really wish you luck about tracking \r\ndown your story, but I got to be straight with you. I am not looking for any \r\nkind of relationship. ",

        "Livvie: Nothing. ",

        "Livvie: Nothing, nothing. I just dropped a glass, that's all. ",
        "Rafe: Nothing? ",
        "Livvie: Nothing. No. No, no, you know what? I just remembered -- we got to \r\nget ready. We got to go to my dad's and Lucy's for dinner tonight. ",
        "Rafe: Livvie, it's pretty obvious you're upset. Just talk to me, ok? Can you \r\ntalk to me? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Look, Rafe, I know this is not possible, but I swear I felt the \r\nbaby moving again. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: I know, I know, I know. It's only a few weeks old and there's no way, \r\nbut I am telling you I felt it. ",
        "Rafe: You heard what Ian said. It is way too early. You feel your body -- \r\nit's just adjusting, it's changing. Maybe -- maybe you're nervous. Come here. \r\nSit down. Come here a second. You know, you're nervous because -- I know you're \r\nscared. You've been scared that I'm just going to leave and you're going to have \r\nto raise this baby all on your own, but that's not going to happen. It's not. \r\nI'm not going anywhere. And as far as what you heard me and Ian talking about -- \r\nthe avatar -- we were just talking, ok? That was just stories that we were \r\ntrading about us being kids. It's not real. You know what's real? This. This \r\nlife growing inside of you. That's what's real. That's our child growing in \r\nthere, and our child is going to change our entire lives.

        "Marissa: Is it just because that you thought, you know, because my mom said \r\nyou were a keeper that -- ",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. Look, I just -- there was this vibe, ok, that you were \r\ngiving off -- ",

        "Marissa: Ok, you know what? ",
        "Jamal: Ok? ",
        "Marissa: Just so we get it clear -- I am here for my story, that's it, not to \r\nget involved with anyone. And, yes, I want to know more about Casey, so I might \r\nstay here a little longer than I thought. But you know what? I'll tell you what \r\n-- I will stay out of your way, you know, so you don't think I'm stalking you or \r\nanything, ok? ",

        "Marissa: Yeah. Thanks, because I thought you'd never ask. ",

        "Marissa: That is my cue, so I'm off to work. Oh, and, Jamal, I will pay for \r\nthat slice of pizza, so, you know, just so you don't think that this was a date \r\nor anything. ",

        "Alison: It's not like it would be a permanent situation. I mean, it's not \r\nreally for me, either. ",
        "Kate: Then why are you offering? ",
        "Alison: Because. I just -- I don't want to be alone. And maybe if there's \r\nsomebody else there to talk to, then I wouldn't spend so much time alone \r\nthinking about -- ",
        "Kate: Rafe? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. You know, I haven't seen you in a while, so I haven't -- I \r\nhaven't really told you this, but Livvie is pregnant, and they are going to \r\nbuild a life together. ",

        "Kate: Don't try to figure it out. It's the whys that will kill you. This is \r\nmy advice, and I know that this is going to be hard, but you've got to let go \r\nbecause if you keep trying to hang on to the past, pretty soon you won't know \r\nhow to stop. ",
