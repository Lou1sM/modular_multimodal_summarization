        "Lucy: Jack, please -- ",
        "Kevin: Jack, let him go. ",
        "Jack: You don't understand. ",
        "Kevin: You don't understand. The police will put you back in jail again if \r\nyou hurt him. ",
        "Jack: \"If?\" ",
        "Kevin: Jack! ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Jack! ",
        "Kevin: Think about Livvie. ",
        "Jack: He kept me away from her. He made me lose time. ",
        "Kevin: He's not worth it. ",
        "Jack: Get away from me, both of you! ",
        "Lucy: Doc, we have to do something. Do something! ",
        "Kevin: What? How? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know, but look at him! He's killing his brother! He's murdering \r\nhim! ",
        "Kevin: Jack! ",
        "Lucy: Jack! ",
        "",
        "Alison: Jamal, I mean, talk about last resorts. All right? ",
        "Jamal: Look, we looked everywhere else. Ok, Jack and Livvie -- they got to be \r\nsomewhere. ",
        "Alison: I know, but with her? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know Gabby threw a lot of attitude the last time we talked to \r\nher. ",
        "Alison: I know, I know, but the stalker matches Caleb's description. I got \r\nthat part. ",
        "Jamal: Right. So if we hang around long enough -- I don't know, the guy might \r\nshow up and -- ",
        "Alison: But the odds of that actually happening, Jamal, are worse than the \r\nlottery. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know. That's why you got to play to win, right? ",
        "Gabriela: Yes, I'm still holding for Mrs. Nielsen. Well, is anyone there \r\nwho's authorized to get into the records at your excuse for an adoption agency?\r\n",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Gabriela: Wait. No, I will not hold! You call me back. You have the number.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Oh, God. What now? ",
        "Jamal: Hey, Gabby, you got a minute? ",
        "Gabriela: No, not really. ",
        "Jamal: I see you're still kind of upset from your brother being hurt, huh?\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, you think? ",
        "Alison: Well, we just thought maybe you could use some company. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, you thought wrong. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: I was just saying having you stay is the most wonderful gift I could \r\never ask for. ",
        "Livvie: After everything you've done for me, I would've been crazy to say no. \r\nJust seeing my mother again -- Caleb, how did you do it? How did you bring her \r\nback here? ",
        "Caleb: I have special gifts most people don't, ways they would never \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Livvie: I guess I'm one of them. ",
        "Caleb: I'll try to explain. What's confusing you? ",
        "Livvie: Everything. All of this. How -- how could you just make my mother \r\nappear like that? I mean, is this some kind of a dream? Who are you, Caleb? How \r\ndo I even know you're real? ",
        "Caleb: Oh, I'm real, Olivia. Let me show you how real. ",
        "Livvie: Show me. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Jack -- ",
        "Lucy: Jack! Please, Jack, stop! Please! ",
        "Jack: No, he deserves it. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sure he does, but killing him won't get us to Livvie any sooner. \r\nWe need your help, Jack! We've got to get to Livvie! ",
        "Lucy: He's not listening. Is Chris worth losing Livvie over? Jack, Livvie. \r\nDon't let Chris hold you back. Let's go find her. Every minute counts, Jack. \r\nPlease. ",
        "Kevin: You told me vampires couldn't kill their own brothers. ",
        "Lucy: A technicality. They -- they can't feed. They can't feed. ",
        "Kevin: But no problem snapping necks? That's quite a loophole. ",
        "Jack: So you guys know about me? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Jack. Yeah. ",
        "[Chris groans] ",
        "Lucy: We sort of put the pieces of the puzzle together. Same to you, Chris.\r\n",
        "Kevin: What the heck was going on in here? ",
        "Jack: My brother decided to lock me in this cage to run experiments on me. \r\nBut I guess I lived a little longer, huh? ",
        "Chris: I was trying to save lives, keep the public safe. ",
        "Jack: You want to protect people, Chris? Here, I'll protect -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no, no! ",
        "Kevin: No, Jack -- ",
        "Chris: See? See what you get? Give that bloodsucking monster half a chance, \r\nand he just goes after the jugular. I'm just trying to keep innocent people \r\nsafe. ",
        "Jack: Safe? You want to be safe? ",
        "Chris: Kevin, Lucy -- ",
        "Jack: Huh? ",
        "Chris: Keep him away from me! ",
        "Jack: You want me to stay away from you, Chris? Where you know you'll be \r\nsafe? ",
        "Chris: Freak. You're a freak! ",
        "Jack: I am? ",
        "Chris: I should've finished -- aah! ",
        "Jack: What do you think about that, huh? I'm sorry. I should see if you want \r\nsomething to eat. Would you like me to grab you a hamburger, raw meat, anything \r\nlike that? You know what? Why don't you think about it? We'll be back. Let's go. \r\nLet's find Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. We're wasting time. ",
        "Chris: You can't leave! Don't go! I'm -- ",
        "",
        "Caleb: Still afraid I'm a figment of your imagination? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not afraid of anything about you, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Even my promise to grant your every wish? ",
        "Livvie: You really meant that. ",
        "Caleb: Anything you want, anytime you want it, all you have to do is ask. ",
        "Livvie: I can't. Caleb, I know you can do what you say you can. I've seen it, \r\nbut -- ",
        "Caleb: But? ",
        "Livvie: You've been so generous. ",
        "Caleb: I'd give you anything I could. ",
        "Livvie: But these powers of yours -- ",
        "Caleb: They scare you. ",
        "Livvie: Maybe they should, but they're just like you. They're mysterious and \r\nmagical. ",
        "Caleb: You're the magic, Olivia. It's you that made the miracle happen. ",
        "Livvie: What miracle? ",
        "Caleb: You opened my heart again. A heart that was -- that was closed to \r\neverything. I was lost. I was wandering alone without love, without light, \r\nwithout warmth. And then you gave me a reason to live again. You're the magic.\r\n",
        "Livvie: What happened to close your heart? ",
        "Livvie: Tell me. Please. ",
        "Caleb: A long time ago, there was another woman. ",
        "Livvie: And you loved her. ",
        "Caleb: One smile from her, and my soul had wings. ",
        "Livvie: But you lost her. ",
        "Caleb: I was very young. I had no patience. But I'm wiser now, and I've -- \r\nI've learned how fragile a heart can be. I just learned this too late. ",
        "Livvie: What happened? ",
        "Caleb: The night before our wedding, before we were going to take our vows --\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh, God. She died, didn't she? ",
        "Caleb: That night I knew I was finished. In the core of my being, I knew I \r\nwould never love again. I lived my life without feeling, and I knew that's the \r\nway it would always be. Until -- ",
        "Livvie: Until? ",
        "Caleb: I saw you, Olivia. And then my heart started beating again. And I knew \r\nI wanted to live forever. So you see, you are the magic. You are the magic. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Gabby! Open this door now! ",
        "Jamal: Ali, just take it easy. ",
        "Gabriela: What the hell do you want? ",
        "Alison: To find our friends, that's it. We tried to be nice about it, but, \r\nactually, I'm getting a little sick and tired -- ",
        "Jamal: Sorry, Gabby, sorry. Look, what she's trying to say is that we have \r\nsome information that makes us think that the guy that's been stalking you may \r\nbe able to lead us to Livvie and Jack. ",
        "Gabriela: What? ",
        "Jamal: Look, we know his name is Caleb. Ok, we know that he's holding Livvie \r\nsomewhere. ",
        "Alison: And he's in love with her. That's what this is all about. Whoever \r\nthis Caleb guy is, he's got a little thing for Livvie. ",
        "Gabriela: What makes you think I give a damn about any of this? And what \r\nmakes you think I have any information about this Caleb and Livvie? I mean, who \r\nwould have a thing for that boney brat, anyway? ",
        "Alison: Whoa, wait a second. ",
        "Gabriela: You know, I have wasted enough time on this stupidity. I want you \r\nboth out of here right now. ",
        "Alison: What is the matter with you? We are just coming here to tell you that \r\nthe guy who hurt your brother might be Caleb. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't want to talk to you or anybody else about Emilio or Caleb \r\nor Jack or Livvie or any of it! I am expecting a very important phone call, and \r\nit is private! ",
        "Alison: Wait -- wait, wait a second! Wait just a minute! I've had all the \r\ndoors slammed in my face that I can take today. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby, just listen -- ",
        "Gabriela: No, you just listen. Just leave right now! ",
        "Alison: No! Not until you listen to what we have to tell you! ",
        "Gabriela: Are you deaf, little girl? I said out of here! ",
        "Jamal: Get your hands off her! What's wrong -- ",
        "Gabriela: And you, too, moron! Get out of my face! ",
        "Jamal: Ow! Gabby, Gabby, my arm. What's wrong with you, Gabby? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ok, Gabby, just chill. We get the message, ok? Just back off and we're \r\ngone, ok? ",
        "Gabriela: Good idea! ",
        "Alison: What the -- ",
        "Jamal: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, just forget it. Forget it. We're out of here. \r\nCome on, let's go. ",
        "Alison: No, we're not. We are trying to find our friends and warn you about a \r\nkiller, and you treat us like -- ",
        "Gabriela: What makes you think Caleb is a killer? What makes you think he \r\never hurt anyone? ",
        "Alison: Why are you defending him? Because that's exactly what it sounds \r\nlike. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Alison: What kind of nut case are you? ",
        "Gabriela: Enough! Get out! That's the phone call I'm waiting for. Turn and \r\nwalk away while you still can. ",
        "Jamal: Do it, Spunky, now. Ok, you heard her. Look, I'm sorry. Ok? We both \r\nare sorry. ",
        "[Ring] ",
        "Gabriela: Hello? Hello? Finally. I've been trying all damn day to get you on \r\nthe phone! ",
        "Alison: What are you doing dragging me away like that? ",
        "Jamal: Look, look, just forget about it, ok? Let's just get out of here. ",
        "Alison: No. I had a few things that I was dying to say to her. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, \"dying\" is the word, ok? Let's just go. ",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? I can handle myself. What is her problem, \r\nanyway? ",
        "Jamal: Ali, listen, listen -- ",
        "Alison: What? What? ",
        "Jamal: Don't you get it? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: In a couple more seconds, her problem would've been our problem. ",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, I had a feeling about it at the hospital -- her and Emilio and \r\neverything -- but now that she's put that death grip on me, I'm sure of it. ",
        "Alison: Sure of what? What? ",
        "Jamal: Gabby is a vampire. Ok, the reason why she doesn't want to talk about \r\nCaleb, the reason why she's protecting him, is because she's a vampire. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: That was such an incredibly sad story, Caleb. So beautiful and sad, \r\nthe way it ended. ",
        "Caleb: That was then. We can add our own ending now, write our own story, \r\nmake it a happy one. ",
        "Livvie: My family is worried about me being with you because they think \r\nyou're dangerous. But if they could only see what I see and know what I know.\r\n",
        "Caleb: What do you know, Olivia? ",
        "Livvie: That you are gentle and giving. You've been hurt, and you're afraid \r\nto be hurt again. ",
        "Caleb: Call them and tell them what you know. ",
        "Livvie: You're serious? ",
        "Caleb: Let the people you love know you're not being held against your will. \r\nLet them know I would never hurt you. ",
        "Livvie: They won't understand. ",
        "Caleb: Then make them understand. You know you can. Make them understand. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Ok, where do we start? ",
        "Kevin: Well, we hoped you'd have an idea. ",
        "Jack: Why? I've been stuck in a cage. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait, wait. We know Caleb probably has Livvie, right? ",
        "Jack: Yes, I saw him take her. ",
        "Kevin: Where? ",
        "Jack: I don't know. He usually tries to find me. ",
        "Lucy: Well, that's because he usually has something that he wants from you.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yes. In this case, my daughter. He wants to make her over to his \r\nbride. He wants to make her over to -- ",
        "Jack: Dr. Collins, you can't hurt my feelings. I know what I've become. Now, \r\nI promise you I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure Caleb doesn't turn \r\nLivvie into what I am, what -- my kind, whatever. You know -- me. ",
        "Kevin: So you do have an idea? ",
        "Jack: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: Why did you just lie? ",
        "Jack: Because I knew you guys would want to come, and you can't. ",
        "Kevin: If you think we're going to let you go off and do this alone, you're \r\nwrong. Livvie is my daughter. I'm going with you. ",
        "Jack: You have to let me go alone on this. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, I can't. ",
        "Jack: Listen to me. I can bargain with this guy. I can make a trade with him. \r\nYou can't. ",
        "Lucy: What kind of trade? ",
        "Kevin: What do you have that Caleb wants? ",
        "Jack: Me. I can give him me. ",
        "Kevin: You? ",
        "Jack: Yes, why not? I mean, he says he's going to turn me or he's going to \r\ndestroy me, and at least this way I can put up a fight. You -- you guys can't. \r\nHe will kill you guys, and that'll make it that much closer for him controlling \r\nLivvie. ",
        "Lucy: He may be right, Doc. He's making some sense here. ",
        "Jack: You have to stay away from Caleb. He is dangerous. You're only putting \r\nyourself in danger when you're around him. I swear to you -- I swear on my life \r\nthat I will bring Livvie back to you. ",
        "Lucy: Doc? ",
        "Kevin: Look, I know you believe you can -- ",
        "Jack: I can. ",
        "Kevin: But not alone. If you know where to find Livvie, great, but I want to \r\nbe there when you do. ",

I'm in a cage, it's in a laborator-- hello? Hello? \r\nIt's in a laboratory, the corridor -- hello? No, I -- no, no, don't hang up. I \r\ncan hear you. I'm just not getting a good -- aah! Ugh! ",

        "Alison: God, this all makes sense now. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, how she knew more about Caleb than she ever let on. ",
        "Alison: See, all the while I thought that she was acting totally crazy, but \r\nreally she wasn't. ",
        "Jamal: No, of course she was. ",
        "Alison: No, Jamal, not for a vampire. I can't believe that we didn't think of \r\nthis sooner. ",

        "Alison: What? What? What? ",
        "Jamal: She must've bit Emilio. That explains what happened. ",
        "Alison: Wait, how can that be? That's her brother. And isn't it the rules of \r\nthe vampires that you can't feed on your own family? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah -- I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure what rules are right or \r\nwrong anymore. It's just -- but you know what? The one thing I am sure of is \r\nthat if Gabby's a vampire -- and she is -- that she can lead us straight to \r\nCaleb and then to Livvie. ",
        "Gabriela: There's no question? You have the adoption papers? Yes, I -- I \r\nunderstand. Yeah, I'll -- I'll be right over. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. \r\nThis can't be true! ",
