        "Ian: Sooner or later, we're going to have to learn to\r\n  clean up after ourselves, you and me both. \n\n",
        "[Knock on door] \n\n",
        "Ian: Especially if company's coming. Oh, hang on. How do we look? You look\r\n  lovely. \n\n",
        "Kate: Pizza delivery. \n\n",
        "Ian: Hey, come on in. \n\n",
        "Kate: Hey. Have mushroom, half pepperoni, as ordered. \n\n",
        "Ian: Well, I've had a lot of pizza delivery in my lifetime and never by\r\n  anyone looking like you. \n\n",
        "[Danny coos] \n\n",
        "Ian: Danny agrees, don't you? Yeah, mm-hmm. \n\n",
        "Kate: Wow. This is much cozier than I expected. Think of you as sort of a\r\n  bare-minimum kind of a guy -- well, not that I do think of you. \n\n",
        "Ian: Uh-huh. Of course. No, no, no. If this looks like home to you, it's\r\n  because of eve. \n\n",
        "Kate: Yeah, she did a wonderful job. \n\n",
        "Ian: Yeah. \n\n",
        "Kate: So half mushroom, half pepperoni, right? \n\n",
        "Ian: Right. Young man, you're going to sleep. You ready? Ok, I'm going to\r\n  put him down. Why don't you make yourself at home and have some wine. \n\n",
        "Kate: Oh, great. \n\n",
        "Ian: Say good night. \n\n",
        "Kate: Good night, Danny. \n\n",
        "Kate: Oh. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. \n\n",
        "Alison: Rafe. \n\n",
        "Rafe: What are you doing here? \n\n",
        "Alison: Well, I'm -- Lucy, she came -- she told me to come by to look at\r\n  some souvenirs that she brought back from London. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Hmm, really? She asked me to come by to have dinner with her and\r\n  Kevin. \n\n",
        "Alison: Oh, so then it's just the three of you? \n\n",
        "Rafe: No. \n\n",
        "Alison: Oh. So then Livvie's coming by, I suppose, to celebrate the good\r\n  news, all you guys together, a nice dinner. \n\n",
        "Rafe: How you doing? \n\n",
        "Alison: I'm so great. I really just never felt better. I'm going to be so\r\n  much better once I leave, so you guys have a nice, nice dinner. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Alison! Hey! I thought I heard you out here. Rafe, what are you doing\r\n  here? You know, you're a little bit early. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Really, because I think I'm here exactly at the time you wanted me to\r\n  get here. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Really? Oh, well -- you're punctual. That's fantastic. Well, now that\r\n  you're both here, why don't you come inside? \n\n",
        "Alison: You know, Lucy -- \n\n",
        "Lucy: Wait, Alison, I got you something. I really want you to see it. It's\r\n  really cute -- \n\n",
        "Alison: No, no, no. We can't do this, ok? I know that you meant well --\r\n  thank you for that -- but this is not right. I'm going to go, ok? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Alison, wait. Well, you know, shoot! I just wonder what that was all\r\n  about, hmm? \n\n",
        "Rafe: Hmm. You know damn well what it was about. You shouldn't have. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I couldn\u2019t have what? You know, I don't really -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: No, you shouldn't have, Lucy. And he's right. You shouldn't have\r\n  done it. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Well? Come on and answer me. I know you're not really human now --\r\n  not anymore -- but I thought you were that night. I thought -- god, I don't\r\n  know what I thought! I was desperate! Why didn't you tell me about this? God.\r\n  I can -- I can feel it moving inside of me already. This can't be. This can't\r\n  be. I want to know what it is. What am I carrying? Say something! Come on, I\r\n  know you're in there! Stop hiding! I know who you are! Please, please tell me\r\n  what kind of thing this is. What did you do to me? \n\n",
        "Shadow: What you asked for. \n\n",
        "Livvie: What? No. No, I never asked for this. I -- stop! What's happening\r\n  to me? What's going to happen? Wait! Wait. Wait. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what were you thinking? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, I was thinking that I think Rafe over there and Alison really\r\n  need to spend some time together to try and settle things -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: They are settled, Lucy! Livvie and Rafe are married. They are\r\n  expecting a child. You can't get more settled than that. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I know that, but I -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: \"But,\" \"but.\" No buts, Lucy. That was cruel.\r\n  That was thoughtless and cruel. To Rafe, to Livvie, and to Alison most of all.\r\n  So that's it. No more matchmaking, Lucy. End\r\n  of story. Finito. Period. Ok? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Fine. Ok, I admit maybe I did make a bad call. But I can't stand it.\r\n  I can't stand seeing the pain in their eyes. I can't -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: Yes, you can. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Look, dr. Collins, please, let me. It's my turn. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, Rafe, cousin -- \n\n",
        "Rafe: No, listen to me; I don't care what you see in my eyes or anyone\r\n  else's, ok? \n\n",
        "Lucy: What are you doing here? I'm trying to help you. I want to help you. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Please don't, don't, please don\u2019t. We're married. It's over. It's\r\n  done. Livvie is my wife. That was my choice. And if you think it would help\r\n  for Alison and me to see each other, I have to tell you I'm really not sure\r\n  that's the answer, so -- \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: Livvie. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Alison was here? \n\n",
        "Jack: Hey. \n\n",
        "Alison: Hi. Ok, so if we're going to get started, let's go. \n\n",
        "Jack: You're early. \n\n",
        "Alison: Yeah. I just kind of figured, you know, why sit around moping and\r\n  thinking about all the things that I can't do and start taking advantage of\r\n  all the opportunities that I can do, you know? So I brought all kinds of stuff\r\n  for pretty much anything. What do you want me in? \n\n",
        "Jack: Show me what you got. \n\n",
        "Alison: Um -- ok, I brought jeans. \n\n",
        "Jack: Ok. \n\n",
        "Alison: You know, jeans, and this cute little red top looks really cute\r\n  with that, and also these black pants. It's kind of a sexier look. And then I\r\n  brought this little skirt, but I don't know. In the case of a motorcycle, that\r\n  might not work. But I did bring this miniskirt and this super cute little\r\n  bustier if you want to do something like that. \n\n",
        "Jack: Well, I would say that you came prepared. \n\n",
        "Alison: Yeah, I did. I came prepared pretty much for anything. And I even\r\n  brought underneath stuff just in case. I don't know if you want to do\r\n  something like that with the jacket or something. \n\n",
        "Jack: What's going on? \n\n",
        "Alison: What? What do you mean? \n\n",
        "Jack: I mean what happened? \n\n",
        "Alison: Nothing happened. What do you mean, \"What happened?\" \n\n",
        "Jack: Nothing, or nothing you're ready to talk about? \n\n",
        "Alison: Let's just say that I'm really ready to get your portfolio going\r\n  and I'm ready to have some fun finally, ok? \n\n",
        "Jack: Ok. If you say so. \n\n",
        "Alison: I say so. Here, take these. And this is really cute. \n\n",
        "Ian: Sorry about that. Took a bit longer than usual to put the boy down. \n\n",
        "Kate: I hope you don't mind. I was just looking. \n\n",
        "Ian: Oh, I don't mind at all. You didn't like the wine then? \n\n",
        "Kate: Oh, you know, I'm not really very thirsty. \n\n",
        "Ian: All right. There's another bottle in there if you don't like this one.\r\n  \n\n",
        "Kate: No. You know, actually, it's one of my favorites. Yeah, Brennan and I\r\n  drink it all the time. Maybe that's why. You know, I drank almost two bottles\r\n  at Cellini's the other night. \n\n",
        "Ian: At Cellini\u2019s? \n\n",
        "Kate: Yeah, I mentioned it to you? It's that place where we always eat? \n\n",
        "Ian: Right. \n\n",
        "Kate: Yeah, rennin\u2019s a real connoisseur. I always let him choose the\r\n  wine. In fact, sometimes I let him pick the whole meal -- \n\n",
        "Ian: I can't let you do this. I'm sorry; I have to be honest with you. \n\n",
        "Kate: Ok. \n\n",
        "Ian: I was there. \n\n",
        "Kate: Where? \n\n",
        "Ian: At Cellini\u2019s. \n\n",
        "Kate: I don't understand. \n\n",
        "Ian: The other night I was there at the restaurant. I was having a drink\r\n  and I saw you. \n\n",
        "Kate: You saw me? \n\n",
        "Ian: Yes. And you were alone. \n\n",
        "Kate: I don't know what you're talking about, Ian. \n\n",
        "Ian: I saw you there at the restaurant. You were there. \n\n",
        "Kate: No. Not me. \n\n",
        "Ian: The bartender knows you, Kate. In fact, I asked him, I said, \"Can\r\n  you send a bottle of wine over to --\" I thought it was you and your\r\n  boyfriend. He says, \"No, no, that's the owner of the restaurant because\r\n  she always comes here alone.\" \n\n",
        "Kate: You were spying on me? \n\n",
        "Ian: I wasn't spying on you. \n\n",
        "Kate: Then why didn't you come over and say hello? \n\n",
        "Ian: Because I didn't want to invade your privacy. \n\n",
        "Kate: And you don't think that's what you're doing right now? \n\n",
        "Ian: We're becoming friends. \n\n",
        "Kate: No, we're not. No, we're not becoming anything. Friends don't treat\r\n  friends like this. \n\n",
        "Ian: I know what you're going through. \n\n",
        "Kate: No! No, you don't know anything about me or my life! How dare you.\r\n  How dare you do this to me. \n\n",
        "[Camera shutter clicks] \n\n",
        "Jack: Ooh. That's nice. That's really nice. Right there, right there. Hold\r\n  it right there. Nice. \n\n",
        "Alison: \"Nice\"? Wait, jack, I'm sort of playing for more, like,\r\n  you know, sexy or smoldering or sizzling or something. \n\n",
        "Jack: All right, well, why don't you give me your sexy, smoldering,\r\n  sizzling smile like that? Oh, man! Whoo! Ali, I've never seen this side of\r\n  you. \n\n",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah? Well, how about -- how about this side? Take the picture!\r\n  \n\n",
        "Jack: Oh. Yeah, right, right, right. \n\n",
        "Alison: See, it's always been here, jack. I've just -- you know, it's been\r\n  a little hidden, that's all. \n\n",
        "Jack: Right. \n\n",
        "Alison: But you'd better get used to it because I'm tired of being boring.\r\n  It was only a hobby. I want to be something better than that. \n\n",
        "Jack: Hey, would you quit talking and stand there so I can take this shoot?\r\n  \n\n",
        "Alison: Well, why don't you just get it on film and not worry about what\r\n  I'm doing. \n\n",
        "Jack: All right, all right, let's go. \n\n",
        "Alison: Because this is the beginning of the new sexy Alison, a new, more\r\n  sophisticated, sexy, turning-over-a-new-leaf Alison. \n\n",
        "Jack: Back this way. \n\n",
        "Alison: Ahem. \n\n",
        "Jack: Hey. What -- \n\n",
        "Alison: Nothing. I just -- \n\n",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no. You all right? \n\n",
        "Alison: No, I feel, like, a little -- \n\n",
        "Jack: Here, come on, come sit down. \n\n",
        "Alison: I don't know, I'm just sort of a little dizzy or something. \n\n",
        "Jack: Well, \"fine\" and \"dizzy\" are not the same. \n\n",
        "Alison: I know. I think I'm just a little dehydrated. I haven't been\r\n  drinking that much water lately. \n\n",
        "Jack: Some water. \n\n",
        "Alison: I think maybe if I just have just a little, I'll feel better. Maybe\r\n  I'll get something to eat. Do you have any muffins? I used to make muffins. \n\n",
        "Jack: Well, you just got out of the hospital, so maybe it's connected with\r\n  that. \n\n",
        "Alison: Uh-uh. I don't think so. \n\n",
        "Jack: Well, I do, and I'll believe it when I hear from a doctor, so let's\r\n  get you checked out. \n\n",
        "Alison: No! What? \n\n",
        "Jack: No, Alison, you're coming with me. \n\n",
        "Alison: No, I'm right in the middle of a photo shoot! I'm doing my big\r\n  debut! \n\n",
        "Jack: You want to come with me, or I'm going to call an ambulance. \n\n",
        "Alison: An ambulance? \n\n",
        "Jack: An ambulance. Come on. \n\n",
        "Alison: Jack, no. \n\n",
        "Jack: Let's go. No arguing. \n\n",
        "Alison: I'm fine. \n\n",
        "Jack: We'll continue this later. \n\n",
        "Alison: But I need to change. \n\n",
        "Jack: Ok, come on. \n\n",
        "Alison: I'm not sick. \n\n",
        "Jack: I know. \n\n",
        "Alison: I swear. \n\n",
        "Jack: I know. \n\n",
        "Alison: I'm really -- \n\n",
        "Jack: I know, I know. \n\n",
        "Livvie: So that's why the door was wide open, because Ali just left? \n\n",
        "Rafe: No, it's no big deal. Lucy just asked her to come by to pick up some\r\n  stuff, that's all. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Oh, that's all? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Yes, that's all. That's the truth, honey, really. She was here and\r\n  she's gone. So right now it's just us, its just family. So why don't we just\r\n  sit down, we'll relax; we'll have some dinner. I made your favorite --\r\n  spaghetti a la Collins. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Mmm. \n\n",
        "Lucy: And -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: And I think maybe you should pour the wine, don't you, Rafe? Would\r\n  you do that r me? \n\n",
        "Lucy: You know, I'm thinking we should chat. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I need you in here. \n\n",
        "Rafe: So -- you can have all the spaghetti a la Collins you want, but there\r\n  will be no wine for you, Mrs. Kovich. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Well, I could really use a glass right now. I should've known that\r\n  Ali wouldn't stay out of our lives like you asked her to. \n\n",
        "Rafe: It wasn't like that. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, Rafe, it was. She was here. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Well, she's not here now, all right? What's the matter? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Nothing. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Are you sure? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Ok, here we go, here we go. Haven't you poured that wine yet? Come\r\n  on, chop, chop, chop. Except sparkling water for you, young lady. Now, I've\r\n  got your favorite right here. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Well, I can't wait. I am so glad that we are all together like\r\n  this. What? Ok. Because, you know, that's what counts, us being together. And\r\n  whose ever idea it was, it was a really great idea, and I'm just wishing that\r\n  we all can be really close. It's just going to take time, I know, and we've\r\n  definitely got plenty of time. I'm just so glad to be a part of it, this\r\n  wonderful family. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, actually, if you were to ask me, I'd say we're all lucky to be\r\n  part of this family. So -- ok, a toast. Rafe, Livvie, here's to you. Here's to\r\n  your marriage, here's to your future. Lucy? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Oh. Oh, oh. Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, whatever. \n\n",
        "Kevin: You're about to embark on the greatest adventure of your lives.\r\n  Believe me, I know. So I know it's been a little bit rocky to get here, but\r\n  from here on in, let's just all promise each other it's going to be a lifetime\r\n  of smooth sailing. \n\n",
        "Livvie and Rafe: Smooth sailing. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. What'd you say? Smooth. There. See? Smooth sailing. You\r\n  know, smoothing sailing reminds me of babies, and babies remind me where they\r\n  come from -- well, it's a blessing -- and they come from angels. See, babies\r\n  are blessings that come from angels, and I believe in angels, Rafe. Tell me\r\n  something, do you believe in angels, because I really do believe in angels. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Ahem. We prefer to think in human blessings, Lucy. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, most of us do. So -- hey, have you had any time to think about\r\n  names yet? \n\n",
        "Rafe: Hmm. No, not yet. I mean, it's always been a tradition in the Kovich\r\n  family, actually for hundreds of years that, the firstborn -- \n\n",
        "Livvie: Ow. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Livvie? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Moving. It kicked. \n\n",
        "Kevin: It's a little early for that, isn't it? \n\n",
        "Livvie: No, it did. I know it did. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, that's impossible. Rafe, come on; let's get her to the\r\n  hospital. \n\n",
        "Rafe: It's ok, I'll take her. \n\n",
        "Lucy: No, Rafe, we can all go together if we have to. \n\n",
        "Rafe: I appreciate everything you're doing to help, but really, if you want\r\n  to help, then please just back off, ok? We don't need any more attention.\r\n  We'll call you as soon as we hear anything. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Honey? \n\n",
        "Livvie: No, it's ok, dad, don't worry. \n\n",
        "Rafe: We'll call. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Drive safe. \n\n",
        "Lucy: What are looking at? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Guess. \n\n",
        "Ian: Pack quite a punch there, counselor. \n\n",
        "Kate: You deserve it. \n\n",
        "Ian: Deserve I? For what? For telling you that you didn't have to lie to\r\n  me, you don't have to hide things from me? \n\n",
        "Kate: Hell, I don\u2019t. \n\n",
        "Ian: I'm not judging you. Just I -- I felt sorry for you, that's all. \n\n",
        "Kate: You felt sorry for me? You think I'm so pathetic that I have an\r\n  imaginary boyfriend? \n\n",
        "Ian: Can you just listen to me? \n\n",
        "Kate: No, you know, I have heard enough. You set people up and then you spy\r\n  on them. You are disgusting. \n\n",
        "Ian: Whoa, whoa, hang on a second. \n\n",
        "Kate: Move. \n\n",
        "Ian: I'm not letting you go. \n\n",
        "Kate: Not letting me? \n\n",
        "Ian: I'm not letting you go, not like this. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I didn't really do or say anything wrong, per se. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Oh, you mean besides inviting Alison over here and being the ice\r\n  queen at the dinner table? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, doc, you know what I'm trying to do here. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Oh, like hell, Lucy. We've been over this. Now, don't make me take\r\n  sides. She's my daughter. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I know. I don't want you to take sides. But I do think I know Livvie\r\n  pretty well. \n\n",
        "Kevin: And I think maybe that's the problem. Stop thinking of Livvie as the\r\n  Livvie that you knew. Start thinking of her as a newlywed and a young mother\r\n  who's scared to death about the child she's carrying. \n\n",
        "Lucy: So you're saying you really believe Livvie can change? \n\n",
        "Kevin: I think events like marriage and pregnancy tend to feed into the\r\n  maturing process, yes. I can't believe that Livvie is looking for trouble\r\n  right now. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Where did you tell dr. Neumann to meet us? \n\n",
        "Rafe: The lounge. She said she'd be here as soon as she can. \n\n",
        "Livvie: What does that mean? \n\n",
        "Rafe: It means she's on her way. Now, Livvie, listen to me, I know how\r\n  upset you are. \n\n",
        "Livvie: No, you don't, Rafe. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Yes, I do, and you're not alone. I'm here with you. I know how much\r\n  this baby means to you. \n\n",
        "Livvie: To us. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Yeah, to us, and it's all going to be ok, I promise. \n\n",
        "Livvie: No, how do you know that? Nobody knows that, Rafe. Nothing. No one\r\n  knows -- \n\n",
        "Rafe: What? \n\n",
        "Livvie: No, please, please, get the doctor, Rafe. \n\n",
        "Rafe: All right, I'll find her. You just wait. Wait right here. \n\n",
        "Alison: I don't mean to say it again, but I am right, I am fine. \n\n",
        "Jack: No, the neurologist said you needed rest. \n\n",
        "Alison: Well, I'm not tired. \n\n",
        "Jack: Alison, I don't care. We're going to take you home and you are going\r\n  to get in bed. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Alison. \n\n",
        "Alison: No, not \n\n",
        "Jack: Stop. Don't argue. Oh, well, look who it is. If it isn't mommy\r\n  dearest. Well, I would congratulate you, but I don't really think you're ready\r\n  for motherhood yet. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm sure, jack; I couldn't care less about what you think.\r\n  And if you don't mind, I'd like a minute alone with Ali, please. \n\n",
        "Jack: I don't think so. \n\n",
        "Alison: No, that's ok. I'll -- I'll talk to her. Why don't you go get the\r\n  car and bring it around front and I'll meet you there, ok? \n\n",
        "Jack: Yeah. Two minutes, tops -- \n\n",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. \n\n",
        "Jack: You're not there, I'm coming back. Good luck. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, thanks. Look, Ali -- \n\n",
        "Alison: No, before you start to go off on whatever it is that you want to\r\n  talk to me about, just know that Rafe and I have talked and he's made his\r\n  intentions very clear. I will leave the both of you alone. And I've accepted\r\n  that. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Oh. Yeah, I'm sure you have because that's probably why you were\r\n  still hanging around at the lighthouse, right? I mean, that's how you were\r\n  letting us be. \n\n",
        "Alison: Lucy asked me to come over and -- \n\n",
        "Livvie: That's right, Ali, blame it on Lucy. \n\n",
        "Alison: You know what, she asked me to come over there and look at a few --\r\n  it doesn't even matter why I was there. It wasn't my fault and nothing\r\n  happened. \n\n",
        "Livvie: But not because you didn't try. But it's not going to happen. Rafe\r\n  is never going to go back to you because he's mine -- mine and my baby's, and\r\n  it doesn't matter -- \n\n",
        "Alison: Are you not listening to me? I told you that I would leave the both\r\n  of you alone. What more do you want from me? \n\n",
        "Livvie: I'm just saying that you can't have my husband. Do you understand\r\n  that? It's never going to happen, ever. \n\n",
        "Alison: I never said that. What is the matter with you? \n\n",
        "Livvie: I can't do this. Stop it! Don't touch me! \n\n",
        "Alison: What are you talking about? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Don't do this to me! \n\n",
        "Alison: Livvie! Livvie! \n\n",
        "Rafe: Livvie? Livvie, are you ok? Are you ok? Livvie? \n\n",

        "Kate: There are 10,000 bars in Manhattan. \n\n",
        "Ian: And I went to the one that you recommended. I thought we were becoming\r\n  friends. \n\n",
        "Kate: Yeah, I thought so, too, but I guess I was wrong. \n\n",
        "Alison: Is she going to be ok? \n\n",
        "Rafe: Alison, Alison, stay away from her, all right? Now! Go away! \n\n"
