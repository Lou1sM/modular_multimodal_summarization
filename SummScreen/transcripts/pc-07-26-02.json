", "", "", "Alison: Yeah. I just kind of figured, you know, why sit around moping and  thinking about all the things that I can't do and start taking advantage of  all the opportunities that I can do, you know? So I brought all kinds of stuff  for pretty much anything. What do you want me in? ", "", "", "Jack: Show me what you got. ", "", "", "Alison: Um -- ok, I brought jeans. ", "", "", "Jack: Ok. ", "", "", "Alison: You know, jeans, and this cute little red top looks really cute  with that, and also these black pants. It's kind of a sexier look. And then I  brought this little skirt, but I don't know. In the case of a motorcycle, that  might not work. But I did bring this miniskirt and this super cute little  bustier if you want to do something like that. ", "", "", "Jack: Well, I would say that you came prepared. ", "", "", "Alison: Yeah, I did. I came prepared pretty much for anything. And I even  brought underneath stuff just in case. I don't know if you want to do  something like that with the jacket or something.

I was just looking. ", "", "", "Ian: Oh, I don't mind at all. You didn't like the wine then? ", "", "", "Kate: Oh, you know, I'm not really very thirsty. ", "", "", "Ian: All right. There's another bottle in there if you don't like this one.  ", "", "", "Kate: No. You know, actually, it's one of my favorites. Yeah, Brennan and I  drink it all the time. Maybe that's why. You know, I drank almost two bottles  at Cellini's the other night. ", "", "", "Ian: At Cellini\u2019s? ", "", "", "Kate: Yeah, I mentioned it to you? It's that place where we always eat? ", "", "", "Ian: Right. ", "", "", "Kate: Yeah, rennin\u2019s a real connoisseur. I always let him choose the  wine.

I've just -- you know, it's been  a little hidden, that's all. ", "", "", "Jack: Right. ", "", "", "Alison: But you'd better get used to it because I'm tired of being boring.  It was only a hobby. I want to be something better than that. ", "", "", "Jack: Hey, would you quit talking and stand there so I can take this shoot?  ", "", "", "Alison: Well, why don't you just get it on film and not worry about what  I'm doing. ", "", "", "Jack: All right, all right, let's go.

", "", "", "Jack: Some water. ", "", "", "Alison: I think maybe if I just have just a little, I'll feel better. Maybe  I'll get something to eat. Do you have any muffins? I used to make muffins.

She was here and  she's gone. So right now it's just us, its just family. So why don't we just  sit down, we'll relax; we'll have some dinner. I made your favorite --  spaghetti a la Collins.

", "", "", "Lucy: You know, I'm thinking we should chat. ", "", "", "Kevin: Lucy, I need you in here. ", "", "", "Rafe: So -- you can have all the spaghetti a la Collins you want, but there  will be no wine for you, Mrs. Kovich. ", "", "", "Livvie: Well, I could really use a glass right now. I should've known that  Ali wouldn't stay out of our lives like you asked her to. ", "", "", "Rafe: It wasn't like that. ", "", "", "Livvie: Yeah, Rafe, it was. She was here.

And  whose ever idea it was, it was a really great idea, and I'm just wishing that  we all can be really close. It's just going to take time, I know, and we've  definitely got plenty of time. I'm just so glad to be a part of it, this  wonderful family. ", "", "", "Kevin: Well, actually, if you were to ask me, I'd say we're all lucky to be  part of this family. So -- ok, a toast.

", "", "", "Kevin: You're about to embark on the greatest adventure of your lives.  Believe me, I know. So I know it's been a little bit rocky to get here, but  from here on in, let's just all promise each other it's going to be a lifetime  of smooth sailing. ", "", "", "Livvie and Rafe: Smooth sailing. ", "", "", "Kevin: Lucy? ", "", "", "Lucy: Oh, right. What'd you say? Smooth. There. See? Smooth sailing. You  know, smoothing sailing reminds me of babies, and babies remind me where they  come from -- well, it's a blessing -- and they come from angels. See, babies  are blessings that come from angels, and I believe in angels, Rafe. Tell me  something, do you believe in angels, because I really do believe in angels. ", "", "", "Livvie: Ahem. We prefer to think in human blessings, Lucy. ", "", "", "Kevin: Well, most of us do. So -- hey, have you had any time to think about  names yet? ", "", "", "Rafe: Hmm. No, not yet. I mean, it's always been a tradition in the Kovich  family, actually for hundreds of years that, the firstborn -- ", "", "", "Livvie: Ow. ", "", "", "Rafe: Livvie? ", "", "", "Livvie: Moving. It kicked. ", "", "", "Kevin: It's a little early for that, isn't it? ", "", "", "Livvie: No, it did. I know it did. ", "", "", "Kevin: Well, that's impossible. Rafe, come on; let's get her to the  hospital. ", "", "", "Rafe: It's ok, I'll take her. ", "", "", "Lucy: No, Rafe, we can all go together if we have to. ", "", "", "Rafe: I appreciate everything you're doing to help, but really, if you want  to help, then please just back off, ok? We don't need any more attention.  We'll call you as soon as we hear anything. ", "", "", "Kevin: Honey? ", "", "", "Livvie: No, it's ok, dad, don't worry. ", "", "", "Rafe: We'll call. ", "", "", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: Drive safe. ", "", "", "Lucy: What are looking at? ", "", "", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Guess. ", "", "", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Pack quite a punch there, counselor. ", "", "", "Kate: You deserve it. ", "", "", "Ian: Deserve I? For what? For telling you that you didn't have to lie to  me, you don't have to hide things from me? ", "", "", "Kate: Hell, I don\u2019t. ", "", "", "Ian: I'm not judging you. Just I -- I felt sorry for you, that's all. ", "", "", "Kate: You felt sorry for me? You think I'm so pathetic that I have an  imaginary boyfriend? ", "", "", "Ian: Can you just listen to me? ", "", "", "Kate: No, you know, I have heard enough. You set people up and then you spy  on them. You are disgusting.

", "", "", "Kevin: Oh, like hell, Lucy. We've been over this. Now, don't make me take  sides. She's my daughter. ", "", "", "Lucy: I know. I don't want you to take sides. But I do think I know Livvie  pretty well. ", "", "", "Kevin: And I think maybe that's the problem. Stop thinking of Livvie as the  Livvie that you knew. Start thinking of her as a newlywed and a young mother  who's scared to death about the child she's carrying. ", "", "", "Lucy: So you're saying you really believe Livvie can change? ", "", "", "Kevin: I think events like marriage and pregnancy tend to feed into the  maturing process, yes. I can't believe that Livvie is looking for trouble  right now. ", "", "", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: Where did you tell dr. Neumann to meet us? ", "", "", "Rafe: The lounge. She said she'd be here as soon as she can. ", "", "", "Livvie: What does that mean?
