Get out of my way.", "Ian:I'm not letting you go, not like this.", "Kate:I have no intention of discussing my private life with you.", "Ian:Kate, what I --", "Kate:You follow me to a restaurant, and then you jump to conclusions because you seethat I'm not with my boyfriend, and then you pump the bartender for information?", "Ian:I did what?", "Kate:I do not give a damn what you have to say.", "Ian:No one followed you anywhere. I went into a bar to have a drink.", "Kate:There are 10,000 bars in Manhattan.", "Ian:And I went to the one that you recommended. I thought we were becoming friends.", "Kate:Yeah, I thought so, too, but I guess I was wrong.", "Ian:I guess so because friends don't lie to each other, do they?", "Kate:Now, are you going to get out of my way, or do I have to scream bloody murder toget out of here?", "Ian:No, go. Sure, go, go. And keep running when someone catches you in a lie. It'svery mature.", "Kate:Oh. Oh, you're going to lecture me on maturity? You know what? I don't thinkwe're done here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marissa:So, you think he's going to make it out of surgery?", "Jamal:Maybe, maybe not. If he does, he's one lucky pimp. I tell you, if we hadn'tfound him, he'd probably be dead.", "Marissa:You know, I know this guy's a really bad dude, but, man, Jamal, you saw what wasleft of him, right?", "Jamal:Yeah, brutal is what it was.", "Marissa:Yeah.", "Jamal:I never thought a comic book hero would put the beatdown on somebody like that.Hey.", "Doree:Ok, you two.", "Jamal:Any word on that pimp?", "Doree:He's still breathing. But we still have a few questions for you.", "Marissa:Oh, great, because you know what? I've got some questions for you, too.", "Officer:Easy, miss. You're not on a school field trip.", "Jamal:Look, I don't know what you want us to tell you, officers. We only found theguy, we didn't see him beat him up or anything.", "Doree:But you suspect that --", "Marissa:It's the shadowy avenger.", "Doree:You sound sure about that.", "Marissa:It's got to be. So any idea who it is yet?", "Doree:Look, there's been no confirmation this so-called vigilante was ever actuallyinvolved --", "Marissa:But the guy that's in there got totally pounded exactly --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris:But not totally enough. He's -- he's going to make it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Doree:Right. Call it in, jerry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jerry:I'm on it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marissa:So, Dr. Ramsey, you must be pretty psyched, saving the life of the man who was--", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris:I just did my job, ok? If there were any real justice in this world, that guywould be on his way to the morgue right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Victor:I hope I'm not too late for dessert.", "Lucy:Too -- dessert? What?", "Victor:Fresh peach. Monk told me that Rafe and livvie were coming for dinner, and Marywas baking pies today, so I -- Lucy, what's wrong?", "Lucy:Oh, nothing. They were here. They left. Rafe had to take livvie to the hospital.", "Victor:Oh, good heavens.", "Lucy:No, it's ok. I think it's just, you know, first pregnancy jitters.", "Victor:So you think everything's ok with livvie?", "Lucy:Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t. Oh, victor, listen-- doc is upstairs, and I really, really -- I just don't want him to hear this.I mean, I don't want him to know that we had this conversation. Could we justnot ever say that we had this conversation but still have it?", "Victor:Oh, dear. All right. My -- my lips are sealed, but my ears are open.", "Lucy:Ok, good. I don't think livvie is ok. I think she's headed for big trouble.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison:I told you that I would leave the both of you alone. What more do you want fromme?", "Livvie:I'm just saying that you can't have my husband. Do you understand that? It'snever going to happen, ever --", "Alison:I never said that.", "Livvie:Oh!", "Alison:What is the matter with you?", "Livvie:I can't do this.", "Alison:What is --", "Livvie:Stop it!", "Alison:What are you talking about?", "Livvie:Don't touch me!", "Alison:What are you -- ow!", "Livvie:Don't do this to me!", "Alison:Livvie! Livvie!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe:Oh, god. Livvie, are you ok?", "Alison:Oh, my god.", "Rafe:Livvie?", "Alison:Livvie? Livvie?", "Rafe:Help!

Now, go away!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Captioningmade possible by ABC, Inc.]", "Marissa:Oh, wait -- hold on, doctor. You don't really mean --", "Chris:You heard me.", "Marissa:Yeah, but doctors usually don't want their patients --", "Doree:Dead?", "Marissa:Right.", "Doree:Well, write this one down -- Chris Ramsey isn't your typical doctor.", "Chris:Yeah, and that guy in there is not your typical collar, and you know it.", "Doree:He's still innocent until proven guilty, doctor.", "Chris:Oh, I see. So I should just keep my mouth shut week after week and patch up allthe girls he sends in here who look like they've been hit by a Mack truck. Isthat it?", "Doree:Chris, we don't know that --", "Chris:The guy takes their money, and he beats the hell out of them. In fact, he justlives to beat up women. If you ask me, he got everything he deserved.", "Doree:Oh. So you think the police should just quit and let this shadowy avenger runthe whole town?", "Chris:That's exactly what I think. It's the smartest thing you've ever said.", "Doree:Oh, really?", "Chris:Yes.", "Doree:Well, I can think of --", "Chris:As a matter of fact, I am for whoever keeps the streets of this town safe, andthere's a lot of other people who feel the same way. It's just about time thatsomebody stood up and said so, ok? That's that. And you and you and you canquote me. Hi. Chris Ramsey.", "Marissa:Anything you say.", "Reporter:Doctor, we're set up if you're ready to give that interview on that vigilantehero.", "Chris:You bet I am.", "Doree:Wait a minute. When did you become spokesman for this psycho?", "Chris:Doree.", "Doree:I want to hear it, Chris. Come on, what's in this for you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie:Rafe, if we lose the baby --", "Rafe:Shh. Take it easy. It's ok.", "Livvie:Oh -- ow!", "Deniece:Livvie, you need to calm down. Just breathe deep.", "Livvie:My god, I fell so hard! I fell so hard!", "Rafe:No, it's going to be ok. It's going to be ok. It's all right.", "Dr.Neumann: Livvie, what happened? My pager just went off.", "Rafe:She fell down the stairs.", "Dr.Neumann: Let me take a look.", "Deniece:I'll get the lab draw tray.", "Rafe:What about the baby?", "Livvie:The truth, doctor, please.", "Dr.Neumann: Well, in an early stage of pregnancy with such a hard fall, there couldbe a serious problem.", "Livvie:My god!", "Dr.Neumann: We're going to need to do some tests on you, and we should run a bloodtype test on you in case your wife has any internal hemorrhaging.", "Rafe:But there's a chance, right? I mean, the baby's going to be ok, right?", "Livvie:Ow!", "Dr.Neumann: Well, I promise, we'll do what we can.", "Livvie:Rafe, please --", "Rafe:All right.", "Livvie:Please, promise me -- promise we'll try again, please.", "Rafe:I know. I promise.", "Livvie:You have to -- you have to promise me, please!", "Rafe:Ok -- ok, yes. Yes, I promise.", "Livvie:Ok. Ok.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack:Hey, Alison.", "Alison:Oh, my god. Thank god you're here. It was so awful.", "Jack:What? What happened?", "Alison:As soon as you left to go down to the car, livvie started arguing with me, andshe fell.", "Jack:She fell?", "Alison:She fell all the way down the stairs.", "Jack:Well, is she all right?", "Alison:I don't know.", "Jack:Well, what about --", "Alison:The baby -- I don't know.", "Jack:Oh, my god.", "Alison:Jack, no matter what I think about livvie, I would never want anything bad tohappen to her or this baby. That's Rafe's baby.", "Jack:Well, no, of course not.", "Alison:It was an -- it was an accident. I never meant for anything to happen, I swearto you.", "Jack:I know. I know you didn\u2019t.", "Alison:I was just about to tell her and I was trying to tell her that I was going tostay away from her and from Rafe and I was going to leave them alone, but shestarted, like, yelling at the top of her lungs and making this huge scene,flailing her arms and everything else. And it was like she was, like, pushingme, almost like she wanted me to push her back or something, like she reallywanted to fall down the stairs or something.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe:Is that what you want to think, Alison?", "Alison:Rafe.", "Rafe:That make you feel better?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kate:I don't know what kind of fools you're used to dealing with, doctor, but youhave no right to question me about my private life.", "Ian:That's not what I was doing.", "Kate:Is your life really so pathetic that you need to follow me around?", "Ian:Hey, hey, hey! You're the one who keeps telling me about this great guy of yoursand how hard it is to have a long-distance relationship, and then you tell meabout this wonderful evening you spent with him. Well, so I asked you about itbecause I thought maybe you'd want to talk about it. I was wrong. You didn'twant to talk about it, so I'm sorry. I'm sorry.", "Kate:Does this \"I'm so concerned about my friends\" act really work for you?", "[Pagerbeeps]", "Ian:What's the matter with you? This is not an act.", "Kate:Saved by the bell.", "Ian:It's the hospital. I got to go.", "Kate:Yeah, another friend in need?", "Ian:You know, I don't have time for this right now. I got to wake up my son, get thebabysitter, and get to work.", "Kate:No, no, don\u2019t.", "Ian:Don't what?", "Kate:Don't wake the baby, I'll watch him.", "Ian:You're going to watch my boy after what we just --", "Kate:Yeah, yeah, after everything that you did. You know, I don't like you, Ian, butDanny is a great little kid. So just -- just go, ok? You said you had a hardtime putting him to sleep. Just let him be. I can make more calls to myimaginary boyfriend.", "Ian:Ah. All right. Ok, I get it. No more questions about your private life. So, whatis this, you're trying to make me feel guilty?", "Kate:You know, it's not all about you, Ian. I like Danny, even though I think hisfather is an ass. How's that for honesty?", "Ian:It's a start. Does it feel strange?", "Kate:Oh, Ian, if you only knew.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris:I have a reporter waiting. What do you want?", "Doree:Out with it, Chris. What are you really up to here?", "Chris:I'm not up to anything. Ok? I meant every word I said. I think this vigilante'sthe best thing to happen to this town in years.", "Doree:So sit back, let him take the law into his own hands --", "Chris:You know what? I think you're just concerned because he's making your jobirrelevant.", "Doree:No, we just don't know if we can trust --", "Chris:Or is it that because you're angry with me because we're not seeing each otheranymore?", "Doree:Chris, this isn't personal.", "Chris:Oh, no, doree, everything is personal. Excuse me.", "Doree:Right.", "Chris:Hey, why don't we get this interview started.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marissa:Jamal, they'll scoop me. You know, out of nowhere, we've got reporters all overthis place, and if I don't get my -- hello?", "Jamal:What?", "Marissa:Did you hear me? They are stealing my ink.", "Jamal:Marissa, you don't even work for a newspaper. What are you talking about?", "Marissa:Not yet, but you know what? If I get this story, I can work anywhere I want. AllI have to do is figure out who this vigilante is, and then -- hello? Earth toJamal.", "Jamal:What?", "Marissa:Help here.", "Jamal:No, look, I'm just thinking that no one's even mentioned -- I mean -- it'sobvious they haven't even talked about what's going on here.", "Marissa:What?", "Jamal:Look, this shadow guy -- every time he comes up. What's his M.O.?", "Marissa:Jamal, that's simple -- he's chasing bad guys.", "Jamal:Yeah, I know that, but not just any bad guy. Ok, now, work with me, ok? Thinkabout it. The first time, it was this guy who beat up his wife, right?", "Marissa:Right.", "Jamal:The second time, it was those thugs who harassed Mary. Now, it's that pimptonight.", "Marissa:They were all threatening women.", "Jamal:And Mr. Vigilante -- he makes them pay.", "Marissa:That's -- that's the link! The shadowy avenger protects women.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison:Rafe, I didn't mean that like that.", "Rafe:No, I know what you meant. You think she fell on purpose, that she deliberatelytried to lose the baby. You know what? She's in there crying her eyes out. Howcould you even think that's possible?", "Alison:Rafe, everyone wants this baby to be ok. Everybody does. I do, jack does --everyone does. It was an accident, I'm telling you.", "Rafe:I'm beginning to wonder.", "Alison:Wait. Are you saying that you don't believe me? Do you think that I actuallypushed her?", "Jack:Come on, Rafe, like Alison would do something like that. I mean, maybe they werearguing.", "Rafe:Ok, let's hear it. Why were you arguing in the first place? I mean, you knowshe's pregnant, she's upset. Why couldn't you just walk away? Why are you evenhere?", "Jack:Because I brought her here because she wasn't feeling well. And that's when weran into your lunatic wife.", "Alison:Hey, listen; stop it, both of you. Don't -- don't argue. Ok? Everybody wants thesituation to be ok. And Rafe is right. I should not have been arguing with her.And the only thing that will make this situation any better is that if thedoctor comes out and says that she's fine.", "Rafe:Nobody knows anything yet. Dr. Neumann's going to run some tests, but it doesn'tlook good. Everything would probably be fine if -- if you never showed up.", "Alison:Rafe --", "Rafe:Just leave me alone, Alison. Leave both of us alone. Ok?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy:I believe Rafe and Alison belong together, and livvie has done nothing but lieto everybody, especially Rafe. She's lied to Rafe about everything. And somebody-- not saying me -- but if somebody doesn't do something, I think the wholething could be headed straight for a big disaster.", "Victor:You know, I remember very clearly the night that monk told me that livvie washis daughter and my grandchild.", "Lucy:What?", "Victor:We talked a lot about how different livvie would be if he had been there for herearlier, just exactly the same thing that I've always wondered about my sons.", "Lucy:Oh, victor.", "Victor:Well, I talked about all my regrets. It was the kind of conversation we reallyhaven't had in a long time, since before I met Mary. And at the end of theconversation, monk said, \"You know, maybe livvie is a second chance forboth of us.\" He was a little nervous about tonight.", "Lucy:Wait a minute. He was nervous about this dinner?", "Victor:He so much wanted it to feel like a normal family dinner.", "Lucy:Oh, thus the peach pie.", "Victor:Well, I wanted to do something nice at the end of the evening for my son and mygranddaughter and my great-grandchild that she's carrying because whatever elseshe is, livvie is family.", "Lucy:So I suppose any other father-in-law probably would have just said, \"Mindyour own business.\"", "Victor:I don't think that ever occurred to me.", "Lucy:No, because you happen to be the best darn father-in-law a girl could have. AndI love you very much. Oh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie:Tell me, doctor, please.", "Dr.Neumann: Your cramping concerns me.", "Livvie:And?", "Dr.Neumann: And we'll know more when we get the tests back. For now, just stayfocused on keeping your baby alive.", "Livvie:Yes, with all my heart.", "Dr.Neumann: I'll send your husband back in. And, livvie, a little prayer neverhurts.", "Livvie:Ok.", "Livvie:Well, I'm sorry I couldn't let you survive, but I didn't know what your realdaddy was or what kind of a monster you could be. But don't worry, I'll tryagain. And this time, Rafe will be your daddy. You know, I had to fix it theonly way I could because I had no other choice.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kate:Hey, sweetheart. Hey, it's me. I miss you so much. I wish more than anything Icould be with you right now. No one understands. No one could possiblyunderstand.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marissa:That's it, Jamal! He protects women -- of course.", "Jamal:Well, it sure seems like it.", "Marissa:Oh, and it is so romantic.", "Jamal:What? Well, let's not forget this guy is beating the hell out of these guys, ok?", "Marissa:So?", "Jamal:So?", "Marissa:Yes.", "Jamal:Well, it's not like he's some sir Lancelot or anything like that, not by a longshot.", "Marissa:Wait -- what did you say?", "Jamal:We still might be dealing with some kind of psychopath running around kickingeverybody's butt.", "Marissa:No, no, no -- the name, the name. What did you call him?", "Jamal:Sir Lancelot. Why? What? What?", "Marissa:Ah, yes! That is my headline!", "Jamal:You\u2019re what?", "Marissa:My first big story -- \"Lancelot comes to port Charles.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reporter:So do you think he's good for the people of port Charles?", "Chris:Oh, absolutely. He's doing a real public service. It's a lot like the portCharles police department, except this guy always gets his man. But if I could,I would shake his hand. Thank you and keep up the good work.", "Reporter:Dr. Ramsey, just a couple more questions.", "Chris:You know, that would be fine, but we do have to kind of wrap this up because Ihave patients to save, you know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Doree:The way he's been going on, you would think he was the vigilante himself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian:Is that right?", "Rafe:An avatar cannot exist independently. It has to find a human body to inhabit, awilling and receptive host.", "Ian:So it could be anybody?", "Rafe:And you'd never know who it is just by looking at it, but gradually its humanqualities are overtaken by the avatar's desire for control.", "Ian:Sounds like the two of you have something in common.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy:Doc, you know, of all people, how hard it is for me to apologize, but I need todo that, so I'm going to try. I'm really sorry for the way I behaved, and I -- Ifeel that it's possible, yes, that Rafe and livvie should be together. And I --damn! I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. Ok, all right.Uh-uh. Can't go that far. I need to think of something a little more plausible.I know. Victor came by today. We had a lovely chat, doc. And, you know, hepointed out to me I haven't really been fair to livvie, and I need to be fairbecause livvie is your daughter. And livvie is also a manipulative little witch,and I'd like -- no. Uh-uh. It's not working. You need to help me here. I can'tquite figure out what I'm supposed to say that I could get away with and that isbelievable that I could do in my heart. So help me. Ok, something I can livewith, something I can really do. Doc, I'm going to try and mend fences withlivvie, and I'll make it work because after all, there is a little teeny babyinvolved and no one wants to see that baby harmed. There.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison:Please, god, please, please, please let this baby be ok.", "Jack:Alison, what do you say we get out of here? There's really nothing that you cando.", "Alison:I know, but I just -- I want to know if everything's going to be --", "Jack:You will know. But say it's good news. Ok? Then you get to sit and watch Rafeand livvie play happy married couple. And if it's bad news, then you're going tobe the one that gets the blame.", "Alison:I know. But I just want to --", "Jack:Alison, this is not a place for either one of us right now. This is the firsttime I've ever agreed with Rafe. But you need to leave both of them alone.", "Alison:Jack, it is not that --", "Jack:Alison, Rafe does not want you here. Come on. Let's go.", "Alison:No.", "Jack:Come on. Let's go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie:Is Alison still here?", "Rafe:I told her to leave.", "Livvie:Rafe, don't blame her. She didn't make me fall.", "Rafe:Don't even think about her. How are you feeling?", "Livvie:Strange, a little. And scared.", "Rafe:I know. It's ok, though. We're going to get through this -- together. I'm notgoing anywhere.", "Livvie:No, and you promised me, Rafe -- and I trust you -- that we're going to have ourbaby. We're going to try again.", "Rafe:I know we will.", "Dr.Neumann: Ah, I'm glad you're both here. We have the test results.", "Rafe:Doctor, I just want to say before that that both of us are very grateful for allthe help that you've given us. And -- and we're ready, you know, whatever --whatever it says, so go on, tell us.", "Livvie:Please.", "Dr.Neumann: Well, I hope you're both prepared for good news because so far,everything seems to be just fine.", "Rafe:Thank god!", "Livvie:You mean --", "Dr.Neumann: That little one's got its heart and soul set on making its way into theworld, livvie. It's quite a fighter.", "Rafe:Oh, a fighter. I guess he takes after his father a little bit, huh?", "Dr.Neumann: Congratulations to you both.", "Rafe:Thank you, doctor.", "Livvie:My god.", "Rafe:I know. I know, I know. This is so wonderful, isn't it?", ">>Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"port Charles: Torn.\"", ">>On the next \"port Charles\" --", "Rafe:Why do you seem so --", "Livvie:So what?", "Rafe:Disappointed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris:Someone else gets to play hero around here. Maybe you can't handle that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison:You're just what the doctor ordered, jack Ramsey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack:I'm glad."], "Transcript Author": [], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNdK0Do9w_A"}
