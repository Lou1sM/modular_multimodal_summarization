        "Jamal: What? You're my sister? ",
        "Gabriela: That's right, Jamal, we're blood -- if you'll pardon the \r\nexpression. ",
        "Jamal: No, this is some kind of stupid trick. ",
        "Alison: Gabby -- ",
        "Gabriela: What do you think, Alison? Am I kidding? ",
        "Alison: No. Jamal! Ow! ",
        "Jamal: You get your hand off of her or I'm driving this stake straight \r\nthrough your heart. ",
        "Gabriela: Is that any way to talk to your family, Jamal? ",
        "Jamal: You think I don't mean it? ",
        "Alison: Gabby, please! ",
        "Jamal: You better let her go. ",
        "Alison: Ouch! ",
        "Gabriela: I never cared much for blue blood, anyway. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, let's get out of here. ",
        "Alison: Wait, Jamal. Wait. What if she's telling the truth? What if Gabby is \r\nyour sister? ",
        "Jamal: She's not my sister. She's a damn vampire. ",
        "Gabriela: Sorry, little brother, but one has nothing to do with the other. \r\nLook, see for yourself. ",
        "Jamal: What is it? ",
        "Gabriela: My adoption papers. Yeah, it was a shock to me, too. But that's not \r\nthe only surprise. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, my God. ",
        "Gabriela: Seems you and I got the same daddy. ",
        "Jamal: How can that be? ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, Jamal, that is your dad's name. Oh! Gabby! ",
        "Gabriela: This is the last time you get in my way! ",
        "Alison: Gabby, you can't bite him, not if he's family! ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, I figured that out. But we vampires got a lot of tricks up \r\nour sleeve, and you're not going to like any of them! ",
        "",
        "Eve: Caleb wants our baby. That lunatic is after our child. ",
        "Ian: All right, all right. Let's slow down for a minute here. A vampire? Is \r\nthat what you said, Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Ian: Ok, that's ridiculous. And you're upsetting Eve. ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry, but you know me. I wouldn't upset anybody if I didn't have a \r\nreason. ",
        "Ian: I agree with you. I know Caleb's got problems. There's no question. But \r\nI don't think being a vampire is one of them. And what about you? You're buying \r\nthis? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, I'm buying this, and we don't have time to talk about all the \r\ndetails. We're asking you to trust us. ",
        "Ian: Trust you? To trust you? You're telling us that Caleb is a vampire who \r\nis after our child. You need to get some rest, both of you. ",
        "Kevin: Maybe you didn't hear me! You want to pop me, go ahead. My daughter's \r\nlife is on the line! Now, I don't give a damn what you believe or what you don't \r\nbelieve. All I know is that the best chance we have of finding Caleb is you and \r\nEve, and until we do, you're not going anywhere. ",

        "Jack: Livvie. No. No. Livvie. No. No! ",
        "Jack: I'm going to kill this guy. No. ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. Oh, my -- it's -- it's not -- it's not her. Oh, thank God. \r\nBut she looks just like her. My God. What has he done to you? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Do it, Caleb. I want to feel it, everything you described, everything \r\nyou promised. ",
        "Caleb: Feel what, Olivia? ",
        "Livvie: You. Your fangs in my flesh. I want you to make me yours. ",
        "Caleb: Why? ",
        "Livvie: What's wrong? ",
        "Caleb: Nothing. ",
        "Livvie: Why did you stop? ",
        "Caleb: I want you so bad. You must know this. But not like this. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb, what do you mean? ",
        "Caleb: We have to wait. ",
        "Livvie: No, I don't want to wait. The time is now. ",
        "",
        "Ian: What are you doing? You think that's going to help you find Livvie? ",
        "Kevin: You don't understand, Ian. Caleb has Livvie this minute. ",
        "Lucy: And he's going to hurt her. That much we know for sure. ",
        "Kevin: Which is why we don't have time to debate this. ",
        "Ian: Go to the police. ",
        "Kevin: You think we haven't tried that already? ",
        "Lucy: They wouldn't help us. ",
        "Kevin: The truth is they couldn't even if they wanted to, but you and Eve \r\ncan. ",
        "Lucy: Please, if you don't want to do this for Livvie, for us, then at least \r\ndo it for your child. ",
        "Eve: Why do you keep saying that? Why would somebody want to hurt our baby?\r\n",
        "Ian: Don't listen to them. You're losing it. ",
        "Lucy: No, you're going to listen to me because this isn't about just my tarot \r\ncards. This is about what Michael told you, Eve, about wearing that necklace to \r\nprotect you from Caleb. This is also about the judge and Emilio and Jack -- all \r\nthe things that happened -- ",
        "Ian: And that proves that he's a vampire? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, this is getting nowhere! Look, just tell us where Michael is. If \r\nhe can lead us to Caleb, at least it's a start. ",
        "Eve: He's probably at the monastery. ",
        "Lucy: The place you and Ian got married. ",
        "Kevin: How do we get there? ",
        "Ian: I'll take you. I want to have a word with that boy anyway. ",
        "Lucy: Let's go. ",
        "Ian: I'll have Frank look after you. ",
        "Eve: No! If you think you're parking me with some babysitter, you're wrong. \r\nIf Caleb is after our son, I want to know about it. ",
        "Kevin: Come on. I'll drive. ",
        "Eve: I want to hear it from Michael himself. ",
        "Ian: What are you doing? I said I'd protect you. ",
        "Eve: I know you will. I know you will. But this couldn't hurt, right? ",
        "Kevin: Let's go! ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: What are you waiting for, Caleb? I'm ready to step into the life \r\nyou've shown me, experience what it feels like to have you drink from my blood.\r\n",
        "Caleb: All in good time. ",
        "Livvie: I don't understand. Why isn't now the right time? Are you having \r\nsecond thoughts about me? Did you change your mind? ",
        "Caleb: No. I want you more with every minute. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Then what is it? I'm right here. ",
        "Caleb: There's something I need to tell you, something important. ",
        "Livvie: No. I don't need to hear it. ",
        "Caleb: You do. For you to truly be mine, there can be no secrets between us, \r\nOlivia. ",
        "Livvie: But you already told me what you are. ",
        "Caleb: There's more. It's about the woman I loved before you. ",
        "Livvie: What does she have to do with us? ",
        "Caleb: She was so much like you. It was so easy to adore her, to want nothing \r\nmore than to make her happy. ",
        "Livvie: Was she pretty? ",
        "Caleb: Not as pretty as you. But she had the same long, dark, beautiful hair. \r\nI remember brushing it till it shone like silk. ",
        "",
        "Caleb's Voice: \"I can hardly describe my elation when at last she agreed to \r\nbe mine. I couldn't wait to make her my bride. The day before our wedding, I'm \r\nbeside myself with joy.\" I went to her that morning, gave her the gift I had \r\nmade for her. I couldn't contain my excitement. I wanted to share everything \r\nwith her right then in that moment, so strong was my faith in her love. What \r\nhappened next was what I most feared. She screamed and pushed me away. Her eyes, \r\nonce filled with love, were now filled with terror and disgust. No amount of \r\nreassurance could convince her I was still the man she wanted to spend her life \r\nwith only seconds before. She told me to get out, to never come near her again. \r\nI couldn't bear the thought of losing her, the thought of her thinking of me as \r\nsome frightening, hideous creature. If only I was able to show her, make her see \r\nhow wonderful and extraordinary it could be, I was sure she would no longer fear \r\nme. But she wouldn't listen. She pushed me away again, and this time, I lost \r\ncontrol. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: I killed her. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, I'm not going to let this happen. I won't. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: So, do you want to leave? ",
        "Livvie: No. I want to thank you. ",
        "Caleb: Thank me? ",
        "Livvie: For trusting me enough to tell me everything. ",
        "Caleb: You're not afraid? ",
        "Livvie: No. Caleb, I'm not like her. I know exactly what and who you are, and \r\nI don't care. I want all of you, all of what you've shown me our life together \r\nwould be like. ",
        "Caleb: You really mean that? ",
        "Livvie: With everything I am. I cannot imagine my life without you. ",
        "Caleb: Olivia, marry me. Marry me on Friday. ",
        "Livvie: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: Yes? ",
        "Livvie: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: I'm going to give you everything you ever dreamed of. ",
        "Livvie: And I'll try to be patient. ",
        "Caleb: It'll be worth the wait. It'll be worth it. I'll make all the \r\narrangements. You're tired. You should get some rest. ",
        "Livvie: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: You have made me so happy. I never thought I could feel this way \r\nagain. ",

        "Jamal: Well, while you're deciding, why don't you tell me why you were coming \r\nafter me?",
        "Gabriela: Because Caleb told me to. ",
        "Alison: Why would he want Jamal? ",
        "Gabriela: Because Jamal was helping to feed Jack. Caleb hates Jack. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah? And how does Caleb feel about you? ",
        "Gabriela: Caleb loves me. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby, I don't know about that. ",

        "Gabriela: I like who I am. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, this is not you. I mean, not really. I know \r\nbecause I know you. You were a good person. You cared about your family, all \r\nyour friends, your patients. ",
        "Alison: Remember when I was sick last summer and I was in the hospital? \r\nGabby, you totally helped me, you were there for me. You were strong and you \r\nwere kind, and I always appreciated that. I'll always remember that. ",
        "Gabriela: That person is gone. I'm better now. Stronger. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, Gabby, you know that's not true. You know what Caleb did to \r\nyou is wrong, ok, because deep down you are the same person. I mean, your heart, \r\nyour soul, your compassion. I know it's got to be killing you inside, Gabby, but \r\nit's not too late for you. Gabby, it's -- Gabby, it's not too late for us. \r\nGabby, you know I always wanted a sister. ",

        "Ian: Yeah, so he'd have a place to house his brother. ",
