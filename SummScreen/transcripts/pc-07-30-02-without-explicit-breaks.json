        "Alison:\r\n  Well, what are we going to do, jack? Where are we going to go?",
        "Jack:\r\n  I don't know. Anywhere but here, waiting to find out if Livvie's baby ok.",
        "Nurse:\r\n  Alison Barrington?",
        "Alison:\r\n  Yeah, that's me.",
        "Nurse:\r\n  I heard about you and Mrs. Kovich on the stairs.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Yeah?",
        "Jack:\r\n  Look --",
        "Nurse:\r\n  Both Mrs. Kovich and the baby are as healthy as can be.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Oh, good. Thank you so much for telling me that. I really appreciate that. Oh,\r\n  this is good. This is good news.",
        "Jack:\r\n  That's great news, ok?",
        "Alison:\r\n  No, this is better than good news. This is fantastic. Now I can try and go\r\n  patch things up with -- ouch!",
        "Jack:\r\n  No, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Why?",
        "Jack:\r\n  Rafe said stay away. Just because the baby's all right doesn't change\r\n  anything.",
        "Alison:\r\n  But, jack --",
        "Jack:\r\n  Hey, you know what?",
        "You\r\n  need to loosen up.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Oh, I am --",
        "Jack:\r\n  No, you're coming with me. No buts. Let's go, elevator. I think I've got a\r\n  place that will work and will help.",
        "Alison:\r\n  I --",
        "Jack:\r\n  Come on, let's go.",
        "Alison:\r\n  I don't --",
        "Jack:\r\n  You're coming with me.",
        "Ian:\r\n  Quite a show back there, Ramsey.",
        "Chris:\r\n  Just call it the way I see it.",
        "Ian:\r\n  And what makes you an expert in the shadow department?",
        "Chris:\r\n  What, the guy pounds the bad guys back under the rocks they crawled out from.\r\n  What more do I need to know?",
        "Ian:\r\n  We need to know what its motives are, so maybe it's enough of the hero\r\n  worship, ok?",
        "Chris:\r\n  Whoa. Whoa, whoa.",
        "Its\r\n  motives? You think this an it? Ian, this is a courageous man who takes\r\n  pleasure out of pounding the scum of society in the name of justice.",
        "Ian:\r\n  We don't know that.",
        "Chris:\r\n  Of course we do. Look at everything he's done.",
        "Ian:\r\n  I have. He takes justice into its own hands, no judge, no jury. What?",
        "Chris:\r\n  Are you jealous?",
        "Ian:\r\n  Am I what? What? Jealous?",
        "Chris:\r\n  Jealous, yeah. I mean, you know, someone else gets to play hero around here.\r\n  Maybe you can't handle that.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Is there any changes at all, dr. Neumann?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Only for the better. I'll be right back and we'll take another good\r\n  look at that miracle growing inside you.",
        "[Door\r\n  opens and closes]",
        "Livvie:\r\n  You know what I need.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  How could you have survived that fall? I mean, I tried so hard to do something\r\n  about that, and --",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Hey.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Rafe.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  So, I called your father on the way in and told him and Lucy the good news.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Great. Thanks.",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Oh, how nice, daddy. You're just in time for a listen.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  A listen to what? What do you mean?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Well, I thought you both might like to hear its heartbeat.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Really? We could do that? That's great. Do you want --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Wait. Dr. Neumann, isn't it -- isn't it a little too soon? I mean, isn't the\r\n  baby too small to have a heartbeat just yet?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Well, if we listen closely, we just might be able to --",
        "[Heartbeat]",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: There we are. Can you hear it?",
        "[Rafe\r\n  laughs]",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Oh. Oh, my god. That's -- that's our baby? That's the heart beating.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  My -- my god. Yeah, it is.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Wow.",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Only --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  What?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Is something wrong with it?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Well, something's a little odd.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Odd? I -- I don't understand. What --",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Well, it's louder and stronger than --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Than what?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Stronger than any other heartbeat this young. It's almost as if that\r\n  awful fall energized it or --",
        "[Captioning\r\n  made possible by ABC, Inc.]",
        "Ian:\r\n  What's going on with you, Ramsey?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Well, an avatar cannot exist independently. It has to find a human body to\r\n  inhabit -- a willing and receptive host.",
        "Ian:\r\n  But it could be anybody?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  And you'd never know who it is just by looking at it, but gradually, its human\r\n  qualities are overtaken by the avatar's desire for control.",
        "Ian's\r\n  voice: Its need for power overwhelms its need to do justice.",
        "Chris:\r\n  Hey, boys! Yeah, I was pretty impressive in that interview, wasn't I? Hey,\r\n  check out the mug, the good side in tomorrow's paper.",
        "Ian:\r\n  You don't have a good side.",
        "Chris:\r\n  Hey, I heard that! Mr. Jealous.",
        "Ian:\r\n  You'd think the doctors in this hospital are a little too busy to deal with\r\n  this kind of circus, wouldn't you?",
        "Colleen:\r\n  Yeah. Not Ramsey. He's been taking a lot of time off this month.",
        "Ian:\r\n  Is that right?",
        "Colleen:\r\n  Yeah, check it out.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Come on, come on. We're almost there. Alison, just come on.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Jack?",
        "Jack:\r\n  Don't fight me on this.",
        "Alison:\r\n  I don't -- I don't think this is a very good idea, sneaking into a carnival\r\n  late at night like this.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Hey, listen to me. The carny owes me. Besides, I think it's a great place for\r\n  you to come and forget about rafe for a while, ok?",
        "Alison:\r\n  Ahem.",
        "Jack:\r\n  All right, glad you agree. Now, where is that? I know it's got to be around\r\n  here somewhere.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Can't we just go see a really good movie or something?",
        "Jack:\r\n  Aha! Bingo! Ha-ha!",
        "Alison:\r\n  Jack, please.",
        "Jack:\r\n  All right. You ready?",
        "Alison:\r\n  I'm so --",

        "[Carnival\r\n  music plays]",
        "Alison:\r\n  Oh, my gosh.",
        "Jack:\r\n  All righty. Step right up! Step right up! We're going to watch the amazing\r\n  Alison unleash holy hell! It's one of the greatest strength shows ever!",
        "Alison:\r\n  Jack --",
        "Jack:\r\n  Guaranteed to blow out every aggression, transgression, obsession, and\r\n  depression right here.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Where did you learn how to talk like that?",
        "Jack:\r\n  I worked a few odd jobs in my day. Now, little lady, you ready?",
        "Alison:\r\n  Fine, carny boy. You win. I'll do it, but I don't really know what to do.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Well, you just stand right over here and you just got to hammer away. Got it?",
        "Alison:\r\n  I can do that.",
        "Jack:\r\n  All right.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Oh!",
        "Jack:\r\n  Come on. You can do it.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Yeah. This is really heavy, and I feel really stupid, so I don't want to do\r\n  this.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Ok, hey, all right. First, let me do it, and then I'll show you.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Yeah.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Ok?",
        "Alison:\r\n  You go.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Because in my research of therapy and on all this, when it comes to releasing\r\n  it, you just got to let it go --",
        "Alison:\r\n  Please be careful.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Because the hammer really works.",

        "Jack:\r\n  Ha-ha! How about that?",
        "Alison:\r\n  Oh, good for you!",
        "Jack:\r\n  Yeah.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Who were you thinking about when you did that, hmm?",
        "Jack:\r\n  No one really important. Only the girl of my dreams, which is now the girl of\r\n  my nightmares. But, hey, your turn. Come on.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Fine.",
        "Jack:\r\n  You can do it. I want you to just let it go, knock that dingy right off that\r\n  thing.",

        "Jack:\r\n  I guarantee you'll feel 120% better.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Ok.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Let's go.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Ok. If I throw my back out, you get the chiropractor bill. I'm going to send\r\n  this bell to --",
        "[Bell\r\n  clangs]",

        "Alison:\r\n  Oh, I did it! I did it! Oh, good for me! Oh, good for me! Good for me!",
        "Rafe:\r\n  I don't really understand. What are you saying? Is the baby's heart too\r\n  strong? I mean, it's healthy, right? Should we be concerned or --",
        "dr.\r\n  Neumann: No, no. It's just a little surprising how strong the heartbeat is.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  There's nothing for us to do?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Except get yourself better. Focus on that.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  So we can go home?",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: Not quite yet. Things seem to be absolutely fine right now, but you\r\n  did take a nasty spill. So I don't want you thinking about leaving till\r\n  morning at the earliest. I want you where I can check up on you, ok?",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Ok.",
        "Dr.\r\n  Neumann: In the meantime, count your blessings.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Well, yeah, thank you. Thanks, doctor. Wow. So I guess somebody besides Dr.\r\n  Neumann is looking after that little guy, huh?",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Hmm. somebody must be.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Yeah. You know, I know I didn't exactly shout my joy from the rooftops when I\r\n  found out you were pregnant, but when I found out that we might lose him, I --\r\n  well, there's nothing I want more than for this baby to pull through.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Are you sure that's what you really want?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Of course that's -- well, why do you seem so --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  So what?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  I don't know. Like you're down.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Do I?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Yeah, yeah, and you've seemed that way since we found out that the baby was\r\n  going to be ok. I mean, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Think I was what?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  I don't know. You were disappointed.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Come on! Just a little bit.",

        "Alison:\r\n  Nana would never let us because I was a Barrington.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Sounds like Amanda.",
        "Alison:\r\n  I know. But I used to catch her late at night watching old movies -- you know,\r\n  the kinds with all the couples. They would go to all the amusement parks and\r\n  the lights would be flashing and they would ride all the rides and they'd play\r\n  and they'd finally kiss and they'd love each other, and there was always some\r\n  beautiful, handsome hero --",
        "Jack:\r\n  Of course.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Who could sing.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Of course.",
        "Alison:\r\n  You know, he would always win the beautiful pink or white stuffed animal. It\r\n  was very romantic.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Hmm.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack:\r\n  Well, I'm not much of a singer, but I tell you what -- I can really play these\r\n  games, all right?",
        "Alison:\r\n  Yeah?",
        "Jack:\r\n  Yeah.",
        "Alison:\r\n  Can you win me a turtle? No. I want a unicorn.",

        "Ian:\r\n  Yeah, her heart rate's back to normal. You got her here just in time.",
        "Frank:\r\n  I was lucky we were in the neighborhood and we got the call.",

        "Ian:\r\n  Well, you ever talked to him about it?",
        "Frank:\r\n  Not that I remember. You know, there was that one time --",
        "Ian:\r\n  Ok.",
        "Frank:\r\n  Ok, when that shadow guy helped out my mom in the park.",
        "Ian:\r\n  I remember that, yeah.",
        "Frank:\r\n  And I mentioned that I thought it was cool what he'd done to those hoods --\r\n  you know, hanging them up by their feet, and I was laughing about it, and\r\n  Ramsey, he went off on me.",
        "Ian:\r\n  What do you mean, he went off on you?",
        "Frank:\r\n  Well, he said it wasn't something I should be laughing about, that this guy\r\n  doles out just punishment and I should be out there thanking him instead of\r\n  laughing at him, which wasn't what I was doing at all. It was weird.",
        "Ian:\r\n  That is weird.",
        "Frank:\r\n  Well, so what do you think is going on?",
        "Ian:\r\n  I don't know. Maybe he just needs to find a life for himself.",
        "Frank:\r\n  Yeah. I think you're right. Later.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Disappointed?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Easy.",

        "Livvie:\r\n  How could you ever even think that I --",
        "Rafe:\r\n  All right, I'm sorry. It was a stupid thing --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Just get away, rafe!",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Livvie, listen!",

        "Rafe:\r\n  Listen, please, I am sorry. I am sorry. I am so sorry.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  No, it's probably you that was thinking, not really wanting this baby. That's\r\n  what you were doing.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Ok, fine, you're right, you're right. I've been conflicted about things, about\r\n  lots of things.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Like me and the baby.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Yeah. I have. That's true, but that's all going to change now. From now on,\r\n  you and that baby are my number one priority, and I know I've said that\r\n  before, but I was really just doing that to take care of you. And now for the\r\n  first time, I really feel it inside of me, and you got to believe that --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  I know, I know.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Because it's true. It is so true.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  I do. I do. Oh, I'm just so tired.",

        "Livvie:\r\n  Please, please. I'm fine. I'm going to be ok. But there's a lot of stuff that\r\n  needs to be taken care of back at the apartment, like grocery shopping and\r\n  errands and stuff like that, and I was thinking maybe you could take care of\r\n  that for you and -- I meant, for all of -- for all of us.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Well, if you change your mind --",
        "Livvie:\r\n  I'll call.",

        "Alison:\r\n  I think so. You're just what the doctor ordered, jack Ramsey. Hmm.",
        "Jack:\r\n  I'm glad.",
        "[Alison\r\n  giggles]",
        "Alison:\r\n  Just what he ordered.",
        "Chris:\r\n  Yeah. No, I've seen the property. It's perfect. Yeah. No, no one is to know\r\n  about this, no one at all. Well, I can't really discuss it right now, but I\r\n  have someplace to be. But my schedule should be getting easier. Yeah, I'm\r\n  considering giving up my medical practice. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to devote\r\n  myself full-time to more rewarding activities. You know what I mean?",
        "Ian:\r\n  Rafe. Hey. You got a minute?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Oh, actually, can it wait? After everything that happened, I just left Livvie\r\n  --",
        "Ian:\r\n  No, it's only going to take a second, but it's more important.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  All right. Ok.",
        "Ian:\r\n  Tell me everything you know about the avatar, how he chooses a host.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Like I said, he chooses someone willing to let him in.",
        "Ian:\r\n  Ok, but it could be someone who wants to be a hero.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  No doubt about it. That's why it's so insidious.",
        "Ian:\r\n  All right, what do you mean?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Well, the more attention the avatar receives for fighting and punishing evil,\r\n  the more the host starts to believe its own hype, and in the end, it just gets\r\n  out of hand.",
        "Ian:\r\n  But the host knows? He knows he's the avatar?",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Yeah, definitely, but where is all this coming from? Do you have a lead? Do\r\n  you know who the host is?",
        "Ian:\r\n  No, no, I don\u2019t. I just -- I want to know what I'm looking for, that's all.",
        "Rafe:\r\n  Ok, well, just let me know if anything turns up, all right?",
        "Ian:\r\n  I will. Thanks. Colleen?",
        "Colleen:\r\n  Yes, doctor, I realize that this is really short notice, but Dr. Ramsey's\r\n  checked out again. No, I don't know where he is. Thanks.",
        "Ian:\r\n  That's becoming a bad habit, Ramsey. What are you up to?",
        "Livvie:\r\n  I know you're here, and I know you can hear me. Look, answer me, damn it! Come\r\n  out and show yourself! Fine. Then you're just going to have to listen because\r\n  a lot has happened in the past 24 hours, and this baby I'm carrying shouldn't\r\n  still be alive. But the doctor said not only was it ok, but it's even stronger\r\n  than it was before, and I want to know why! You have to tell me! I need to\r\n  know what is growing inside of me! Is this -- is this baby human? Come out\r\n  here!",
        "Avatar:\r\n  You should not be here.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  Damn you. I need you to tell me what is growing inside of me right here and\r\n  right now, or I'm going to tell everybody in port Charles who you really are!",
        ">>\r\n  Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"port Charles: Torn.\"",
        ">>\r\n  On the next \"port Charles\" --",
        "Lucy:\r\n  Livvie. Oh. I thought she was supposed to stay in bed.",
        "Livvie:\r\n  I warn you -- I'm going to blow your cover sky-high.",
        "Avatar:\r\n  Say nothing, or I will reveal that I am the true father of your child.\n"
