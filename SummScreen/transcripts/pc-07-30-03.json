        "Alison lets Caleb know in no uncertain terms that his attempt to kill Jamal wasn't a good move. Caleb offers to have the band play at her fashion show in a mutually beneficial arrangement that would bring business to the gym and give the band a chance to try out a new song. Lucy is dumbfounded by Rafe's determination to stay out of whatever Caleb is planning. She doesn't understand how he can do it, but Rafe explains his promise to Alison that they will have a normal life. Because of what she's sensing in the universe, Lucy intends to cancel plans for a picnic, but Rafe urges her to go on the picnic and give Christina the normal life that Lucy won't give herself. At the hospital, Ian pages Chris to broach the subject of dealing with the aging process. Kevin overhears and agrees to keep the secret if it will benefit his daughter, who is also a vampire. When Lucy and Christina arrive to take Ian on the picnic, Christina invites Kevin to go with them. At Body and Soul, Reese tells Jack that she's been too busy to even think about returning his calls. After talking about their families, Ricky invites Reese over for some arroz con pollo that his mother gave him. Jack tells Jamal about his girlfriend's abrupt change of heart, and when he mentions making a wish involving her, Jamal fills him in on the ring's powers. Unconvinced, Jack tests Jamal's theory by asking Reese what would have happened if he really had proposed. Contrary to last night, Reese isn't interested in a long-term relationship with him. Jack is annoyed with Jamal for not telling him about the ring's powers sooner, because he would have made his wishes count. Pointing out that the ring is dangerous, Jamal says that he's glad it's at the bottom of the river. When Alison takes Caleb to see Rafe, she's surprised when her fiance agrees to let the band play."

        "Jack: Hey. Chugging the water, huh?",
        "Reese: Hey, how's it going?",
        "Jack: Good. How are you? Things cool with you?",
        "Reese: Yeah. Couldn't be better.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I just haven't heard from you. You haven't been returning my phone calls. In fact, you've kind of fallen off the face of the earth.",
        "Reese: Oh, god! It totally went out of my head. I've just been working on this new material and I've just been so crazy busy. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Hey, well, you can always make it up.",
        "Reese: Oh, you're sweet.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Reese: But there's something I need to take care of. Ok? Excuse me.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Let's try that heavy bag, work off some of that tension you got carrying around.",
        "Jack: Hey, what's up, dude?",
        "Jamal: What's up? Hey -- we cool, or what?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, we're always cool. I gave you the ring, you tossed it.",
        "Jamal: Yep.",
        "Jack: End of the story, and it looks like it's the end of the story with her, too.",
        "Jamal: What, you and Reese?",
        "Jack: No, I think it's just -- ok, one minute she's worshipping me at my altar. And then the next, she's -- well, she's moving on.",
        "Jamal: Well, you know women. Got to love them.",
        "Jack: No, Jamal. I mean, she was kind of smothering me, you know? I mean, she wanted to move in, she wanted to take over my closet --",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Jack: She wanted to pick out china patterns, the whole nine yards. And so, I kind of wished that she'd maybe move on, find something else, maybe someone else --",
        "Jamal: Wait, wait -- you wished for this?",
        "Jack: Well, yeah. You know, I thought it might make it easier on me.",
        "Jamal: Oh, man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Well page him again, would you?",
        "Chris: Hey, is that you paging me?",
        "Ian: Where the hell have you been? You were supposed to be here an hour ago.",
        "Chris: Oh, sorry.",
        "Ian: What the hell is that?",
        "Chris: I got caught up. What?",
        "Ian: That.",
        "Chris: What -- oh, it's mud. Just getting a facial.",
        "Ian: Facial? A mud facial?",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah, we all have our priorities. What do you want?",
        "Ian: Yeah. Well, my priority is dealing with this curse. The synthetic blood is a great step in the right direction.",
        "Chris: Yes, it is a great step.",
        "Ian: But now what we need to do is deal with the aging process of the vampire.",
        "Chris: You're talking about a cure.",
        "Kevin: He's talking about dying.",

        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Lucy: There you are. Finally. I have been waiting and waiting and waiting for you.",
        "Rafe: Yeah? You felt it, too, didn't you?",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy, did I, stronger than ever. All right, what does it mean?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. What do you think?",
        "Lucy: I think Caleb -- that's what I think. So -- so what? What about him?",
        "Rafe: It probably has something to do with the ring.",
        "Lucy: Ok, the ring. Right. So, what are we going to do about it?",
        "Rafe: We're going to -- we're -- we're not going to do anything.",
        "Lucy: What -- we're not? What has happened to you?",
        "Rafe: I just -- I can't -- I can't do this anymore, ok? This guy has me scratching every time he has an itch and I just don't want to do it.",
        "Lucy: What? We fight vampires. That is your calling. What are you talking about?",
        "Rafe: Um -- ok. Apparently, you're not hearing me. It's over, all right?",
        "Lucy: Rafe, wait a minute. Ok, ok, just suppose I heard you and I allow you to say \"it's over.\" The question is, why?",
        "Rafe: Because -- because I promised. I promised Alison, ok? I promised her I'd stop this whole war, I'd let it go, so that's what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What do you want, Caleb? Why are you here?",
        "Caleb: And how are you, Alison?",
        "Alison: I'm actually fine, but I don't really care to see you and I think that if you're here to see my mother, I don't think she wants to see you, either.",
        "Caleb: And here I was -- I thought we made real strides on the Fourth of July, and as an aside, I don't really have any interest in Elizabeth anymore.",
        "Alison: Then I'm going to ask you again -- why are you here?",
        "Caleb: I have a proposition for you.",
        "Alison: I promise you -- whatever it is, the answer is absolutely no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Alison knows what you do and what you are and who you are.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah, to a point, but she thinks this whole thing between me and Caleb is -- it's personal.",
        "Lucy: Of course it's personal. You -- you two have been trying to off each other for god knows how long.",
        "Rafe: You know what? It's more than that. Ok? She believes -- and you know what? I'm not entirely convinced that she's wrong -- that I've just been fighting this war for so long that it's -- it's just -- it's -- it's sunken into me. It's a part of me and I can't let it go, so I made her a promise.",
        "Lucy: Uh -- ok. A -- a promise? What -- what do you mean? What kind of promise?",
        "Rafe: Lucy, look at this place. I mean, thanks to you, you gave us the lease for this, and Alison and I, we -- we did it, you know? This -- this is -- this is our gym, you know? It's our -- it's our business, it's our home. Do you know how amazing it is that it even happened at all?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I do. It is amazing. You worked very hard and I'm very, very proud of you.",
        "Rafe: No, but you know what? But here's the thing, it -- it would've happened a lot sooner, but our lives were on hold, you know? And they -- they were on hold, why? Because first, we were fighting Caleb. Then we were fighting with Caleb -- and stop me when you sense a pattern here.",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. I -- I sense a pattern. I get what you're saying, but we have all had to do what we have to do and we all, all of us, make sacrifices.",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine, fine. We all make sacrifices, that's great, but you know what? It stops here. Absolutely stops here. I mean, because of Caleb, everything in our lives gets put in second place. I mean, Alison and I -- our lives aren't ever going to get started because we're always going to be fighting another demon. Don't you think people have a right to grab a hold of their future? Make it happen, make it real?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I do, especially you two. You deserve happiness because you are so brave and so selfless and you know -- you know I believe in you more than anybody else does. I do.",
        "Rafe: I can feel a \"but\" coming --",
        "Lucy: Well, I have to -- yeah, ok. The \"but\" is -- Rafe, come on! The slayer in me does not understand what you're doing here. The slayer in you -- this has got to be wrong for you because right now, you know, while we're sitting, Caleb is dreaming up something, he's getting stronger --",
        "Rafe: It doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter. Look, Caleb -- Caleb and I, we made each other a promise. We promised that we would let each other live in peace.",
        "Lucy: Oh, right! And this feeling -- you know how strong it is and it's evil!",
        "Rafe: Ok, but --",
        "Lucy: You feel it!",
        "Rafe: No, believe me. Everything in me is screaming to just find Caleb and fight him to the finish, but I -- I promised Alison that I would give her my best version of a normal life, so that's what I'm going to do, ok? Look, I have to try.",
        "Lucy: Right. Ok, ok! Of course you do -- you have to try. You know, you're forgetting something, though -- I tried normal. I did once. It didn't quite work, but I -- I do still wonder what it would feel like. I -- I get what you're saying not to have to wake up in the morning wondering when that rush of the battle is going to come on, that you have to run out and do something to save the world or -- or what crisis is going to befall you all of a sudden that you've got to take care of that minute. Yes, I wonder, ok?",
        "Rafe: See, but the good stuff, the good part of life -- I mean, to -- come on! Don't you want to know what that feels like?",
        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, and I've been trying. I -- I had this whole little picnic planned with Christina and Ian today and then this feeling swept over me about Caleb and so I thought I'd better cancel that picnic --",
        "Rafe: No, don't --",
        "Lucy: And not go.",
        "Rafe: Don't. Lucy, don't. Don't cancel it, ok? You take your daughter and you go on a picnic. All right? You give her the life that you don't give yourself.",
        "Lucy: This is crazy. Ok.",
        "Rafe: A little bit.",
        "Lucy: I will go on the picnic because I guess the end of the world can wait for five minutes. Oh, cousin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You want to hear me out before you make up your mind?",
        "Alison: You attacked one of my very good friends the other night.",
        "Caleb: You have so many \"very good friends,\" it's sometimes hard to track. I assume you're talking about Jamal.",
        "Alison: Yes, I'm talking about Jamal, all because of this stupid ring. You nearly snapped his neck just because you could, so forgive me if I don't want to hear anything you have to say. As a matter of fact, I really couldn't care less if I ever even saw you again.",
        "Caleb: I thought I could help you out.",
        "Alison: And how's that?",
        "Caleb: My services -- as a musician. I thought you might like to have The Stephen Clay Experience play at your fashion show.",
        "Alison: Why would you offer something like that?",
        "Caleb: Hey, do you want the show to be a success or not? And no matter what you think of me, i know you like my music.",
        "Alison: Well, I like a lot of things that aren't good for me. I like chocolate and fudge and a lot of things.",
        "Caleb: And if you'd like a good turnout at the gym, you'll let us play because you can't buy the kind of press you'd get from us.",
        "Alison: Right, and what's in it for you?",
        "Caleb: A step towards a peaceful co-existence.",
        "Alison: Oh. So this is just, like, a measure of good will. Is that it?",
        "Caleb: Of course not. No, I -- I want something, too.",
        "Alison: Of course you do.",
        "Caleb: I'd like to try out the band's new single, something we've been working on. I've been looking for a live venue, something obscure where I could get some feedback. So what do you say? I get my showcase, you get your fashion show.",
        "Alison: Well, in that case, then I have a proposition for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not checking out any time soon.",
        "Kevin: No, but you two are cooking something up, aren't you? And I'll bet we won't find it in any journal of American medicine.",
        "Chris: This is really none of your business.",
        "Ian: It's all right. I took what you said to heart and I'm -- we're trying to find a way to make this -- this curse a little less eternal, if that makes sense.",
        "Kevin: You mean like a reverse fountain of youth?",
        "Chris: Well, well, you win the prize.",
        "Ian: I'm asking you to keep quiet about it.",
        "Kevin: You mean to Lucy? Ian, I have to say, you're just getting started. That's no way to run a relationship -- keeping secrets from your lover.",
        "Ian: That doesn't concern you.",
        "Kevin: Actually, I do have a personal stake in this and not because of Lucy but because Livvie is one of you, too. So, if my daughter can benefit from this, your secret's safe with me.",
        "Chris: Well, I'll leave you two to play nice and I'll keep you posted.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Chris: Hey, Lucy, Christina.",
        "Lucy: Hi, Chris.",
        "Christina: Daddy!",
        "Kevin: Ah, Christina! Oh, my gosh! Oh, look at you! You're getting so much bigger all the time. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: That's good.",
        "Ricky: Right here from the hit?",
        "Reese: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ricky: I'm ready.",
        "[Reese giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Dude, I -- I can't believe this.",
        "Jack: Yeah. What?",
        "Jamal: I mean, you wished for some space with Reese, but now, you barely exist to her.",
        "Jack: Yeah? So what?",
        "Jamal: Well, you made the wish the night you had the ring, right?",
        "Jack: Hey, Jamal, what are you getting at?",
        "Jamal: Well, \"someday\" has now happened.",
        "Jack: Ok, speak English because I have no idea what you're saying.",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm saying you wanted to know what the ring did, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Well, Reese didn't just stop digging you for no reason at all. It's the ring, dude. Look, look, the ring has this power to make wishes come true.",
        "Jack: Come on, dude.",
        "Jamal: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Jack: That's nuts, seriously.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know it's nuts, but check this out for nuts, dude -- I'm in my room, right? And I'm feeling lonely and wishing there was somebody in my life and Imani literally drops through the roof onto my bed.",
        "Jack: Because of the ring?",
        "Jamal: That's what I'm saying. Look, I'm in the bike shop and I wish for a pile of cash -- boom, there it is right there. I want to know what Imani's thinking and I can literally hear her thoughts. I'm like, it's crazy.",
        "Jack: Ok, ok, ok, so -- so you're saying that I lost my girl because --",
        "Jamal: Because you asked for it. And your wish has come true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: So, are you really ok?",
        "Ricky: Yeah. Look, I'm sorry I was such a jerk the other night.",
        "Reese: Don't worry about it.",
        "Ricky: I was pretty over the top, huh?",
        "Reese: I know what it's like when people try to cover their soft spots and I know you have them.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, you got one, too.",
        "Reese: So, really, what was the problem?",
        "Ricky: It's Casey. I've been seeing her a lot lately.",
        "Reese: Oh, so she's back from --",
        "Ricky: No. See, that's just it -- she's not back, at least I don't think she is.",
        "Reese: But you just said --",
        "Ricky: I know. I said I've been seeing her, but I don't know if it's real or something I'm making up in my mind because I miss her so much.",
        "Reese: Wow! So you're, like, hallucinating or something.",
        "Ricky: I don't know. All right? All I know is it can't be too good to be talking to somebody who's not really there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rafe yells]",
        "Rafe: That's for you, Caleb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: I don't know, Reese. Maybe I'm having some sort of nervous breakdown.",
        "Reese: Or maybe you're just lonely. I know how that feels.",
        "Ricky: Yeah. Maybe. I mean, I keep seeing her. I mean, I -- dancing with her, kissing her.",
        "Reese: What? You can tell me.",
        "Ricky: You think she's just laying low or am I just this -- this big loser who misses this girl so much that I'm making her up?",
        "Reese: The fact that you're talking about yourself in the third person is not a positive sign.",
        "Ricky: This is having such a weird effect on me. I mean, I actually went to see my parents.",
        "Reese: I didn't realize they lived so close.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I got parents and I got a ton of brothers and one older sister.",
        "Reese: Wow. Have they ever come see us play?",
        "Ricky: Reese, I'm like the bad boy in the family, all right? I've been in and out of trouble my whole life. I even went to jail. It's not exactly the kid that parents like to brag about.",
        "Reese: People change, you know?",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, it's all relative. My sister's a nurse. One of my brothers is a paramedic, the other one's a teacher. My brother Luis just graduated high school and he's got some sort of scholarship to a college. Me, I'm a drummer in a band. Not exactly the stuff that impresses my parents.",
        "Reese: Wow, I couldn't imagine what it's like to be in a big family like that. Growing up, it was just me and my mum, you know. Quite quiet. A bit like a tomb.",
        "Ricky: That sounds pretty bad.",
        "Reese: Oh, don't get me wrong. It wasn't as bad as it sounds. There was lots of love. Just not that much joy.",
        "Ricky: You know, this time around, my mom sent me home with, like, a week's worth of food. She makes the meanest arroz con pollo.",
        "Reese: Excuse me?",
        "[Reese laughs]",
        "Ricky: Don't worry about it. It's great. Hey, we got some time before rehearsal. How about a little home cooking?",
        "Reese: Sounds exotically, interestingly lovely.",
        "Ricky: All right.",
        "[Reese giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, so you're telling me the truth, that this ring really makes dreams come true.",
        "Jamal: It's crazy, huh?",
        "Jack: Yeah, too crazy.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Jack: There's only one way to find out, too. I'll be back.",
        "Jamal: Handle it.",
        "Jack: Hey, Reese.",
        "Reese: Hey! I was just heading out. Got to go to rehearsal.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Can I talk to you for a minute? I just want to clear things up between us.",
        "Reese: Yeah. Ricky, I'll be right there. What's going on?",
        "Jack: Hey, look, I know you're busy, all right?",
        "Reese: No, it's all right.",
        "Jack: No. Ok, last night, when you saw that ring, you thought --",
        "Reese: Yeah, that you were going to propose, yeah. It was a mistake. It's cool.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, ok. But what if it wasn't?",
        "Reese: Sorry?",
        "Jack: What if I would have asked you to marry me? What would you have said?",
        "Reese: Well, that's a bit odd, isn't it? Because you didn't.",
        "Jack: I know, but what if I would have?",
        "Reese: Look, Jack -- I really like you. I really do.",
        "Jack: Good, because I really like you, too.",
        "Reese: It's just that lately I've just been seeing our relationship through different eyes.",
        "Jack: But we do have a lot of fun.",
        "Reese: We do.",
        "Jack: So I don't see where you're coming from.",
        "Reese: I just -- we're not into this long-term, \"hearts locked together for eternity\" type thing. Do you know what I mean?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.",
        "Reese: Listen, Jack, you're a really great guy, you really are. I'm sorry.",
        "Jamal: See you later.",
        "Reese: Bye.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "Jack: Last night, Reese would have carried me over the threshold.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Like I said, huh?",
        "Jack: Dude, you're right. I mean, you are right about that ring.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Hey, did you want to -- I'm sure you could get back with her if you really tried hard.",
        "Jack: No, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, that's not what's ticking me off.",
        "Jamal: Well, what?",
        "Jack: I could have wished for anything I would have wanted. And how cool would that have been? But why didn't you tell me this? Why did you --",
        "Jamal: Because I think it's dangerous, that's why.",
        "Jack: No, Jamal, it's a gold mine, and you --",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, no, no, no. That thing is dangerous, ok? It's the reason why Caleb went after Imani. It's the reason why I almost took you out, man. I have no problem with that ring being at the bottom of the river where it can't hurt anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Is everything ok?",
        "Ian: Not to worry.",
        "Christina: We're going on a picnic, daddy. Me, mommy, and Ian.",
        "Kevin: Oh!",
        "Ian: I've been looking forward to it all day.",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, that sounds to me like you've got big, big plans, so why don't you go and have a great time and I'll call you tomorrow?",
        "Christina: Don't go, daddy. You should come with us. Tell daddy to come with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Caleb came to me with an offer.",
