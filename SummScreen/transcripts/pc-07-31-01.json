        "Alison: You haven't said very much, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Well, there's not much to say, Spunky. I mean, first I find out \r\nGabriela's a vampire and now I find out she's my sister. ",
        "Alison: I know. I know. I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, it's ok. I mean, I'm just a little -- I'm a little \r\nshell-shocked right now, you know? ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Jamal: Maybe I should've stayed or something. I don't know, it's just -- ",
        "Alison: To do what, Jamal? She said she was going to kill us. Ok, Gabriela -- \r\nshe's not human. ",
        "Jamal: I know what she is. She's a vampire and she's dangerous. She's under \r\nthat freak Caleb's spell. But still -- ",
        "Alison: I know. I know, she's family. Ok, Jamal, I know this has got to be \r\nvery strange, ok, and very awkward for you, but I think you just need to give \r\nyourself some time to -- smoke. Smoke. ",
        "Jamal: Smoke? I don't smoke, Spunky. ",
        "Alison: No, I -- I smell smoke. It's -- it's in that building over there. \r\nCome on! Come on! ",

        "Karen: Frank, I'm sorry, but this place is like a ghost town. There's no Ian, \r\nno Eve, Kevin's canceled all his appointments, and I can't even reach Chris. ",
        "Frank: Well, didn't he take a vacation? He's probably shacked up on a beach \r\nsomewhere twisting the wings off flies or whatever else Ramsey does for fun. ",
        "Karen: Well, we're so understaffed, even Ramsey would be a welcome sight. ",
        "Frank: I'm sensing our date is not happening. ",
        "Karen: Can I take a rain check? ",
        "Frank: Well, yeah, sure. I could probably get the mariachi band to serenade \r\nyou another night, and just because I had to sell my truck to get reservations \r\nat that that new restaurant -- ",

        "Alison: Jamal, hurry up. Where is all this smoke coming from? ",
        "Jamal: I'm coming, I'm coming. Right here, under the door. ",

        "Jamal: Right here. ",

        "Jamal: Ow! It's wired. We can't get in. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. We have to get him out of there! ",
        "Chris: The dial -- ",
        "Alison: What? What? ",
        "Chris: The switch on the desk. ",
        "Alison: Where? Where? ",
        "Chris: Next to the microscope! It's a dial! Turn it down. There's keys up \r\nthere. ",
        "Alison: Here the are. Hurry. Hurry. Jamal, hurry, hurry, hurry. Sit down. Sit \r\ndown. I'll get you some water. ",
        "Jamal: Chris, you ok? ",
        "Chris: I yelled for hours. Nobody came. ",
        "Alison: Oh, God, here, drink this. ",
        "Chris: I just set the fire to try to set off the alarms, but the stupid thing \r\nmust be broken. ",
        "Chris: Your good friend Jack threw me in there. ",
        "Alison: Jack? Wait, was he with Livvie? ",
        "Jamal: Where'd he go? ",
        "Chris: No. Where did he go? I have no idea. I was too busy trying to keep his \r\nfangs away from my throat. And yes, I know all about Jack. He took off with Lucy \r\nand Kevin. They went looking for Livvie. I was just stuck in here too busy \r\ntrying to save my own life. ",
        "Jamal: We've been looking for him. How'd he end up here? ",
        "Chris: I don't know. ",
        "Jamal: This cage -- this cage was for him, wasn't it, Chris? ",
        "Chris: Look, it was to contain him. ",
        "Alison: You locked him in a cage? Oh, God, we should call the cops and \r\nhave them lock you up for kidnapping! ",
        "Chris: Kidnapping, huh? Kidnapping a vampire? Go ahead, give them a call. Be \r\nmy guest. That'd be great. Meanwhile, Jack's out there stalking dinner. ",
        "Jamal: He's not like that. ",
        "Chris: Uh-huh. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, look, he's fighting it, ok, and plus there's others out there \r\nthat are much more dangerous. ",
        "Chris: What, is there something in the water? How many vampires are there?\r\n",
        "Jamal: Know what? Just stay out of this. Mind your business. Come on. I may \r\nbe Jack's only hope for a cure right now. ",
        "Alison: Look, we don't know where Jack is! ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but you said there were others. Are there or are there not? \r\nBecause I need to know. Guys, all I need is one specimen and maybe I can reverse \r\nall this. What, unless you want to wait for the townspeople to round up Jack \r\nwith their torches. ",
        "Jamal: Gabriela. All right? She's one, too. ",
        "Chris: Gabby? Oh, wow. The blood bank. Of course. It makes sense. ",
        "Jamal: We got to find her and help her, too, ok, before she gets in too deep, \r\nbefore she hurts herself or somebody else. ",

        "Frank: Stop saying you're sorry. I know how busy you are. ",

        "Karen: Hmm. ",
        "Frank: We'll pick this up tomorrow, ok? ",
        "Karen: Yeah, well, it seems like we're always waiting for tomorrow, and I \r\nhate it. So I'm going to round up the troops, get some nurses in to help, hmm?\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Karen, I need to see you. ",
        "Karen: Hey, great. Perfect timing. I was just going to page you to ask you if \r\nyou could save my life and do a shift tonight? ",
        "Gabriela: Audrey Hardy's not in her office. I'd like you to accept this. ",

        "Ian: I thought I'd seen everything. You -- you were bitten by -- and now \r\nyou're -- ",
        "Jack: Yeah. You couldn't have said it better. ",
        "Michael: So you all know about Caleb. ",
        "Lucy: Uh -- yeah, we sure do. We sort of put the pieces together about Jack, \r\nand those red eyes and fangs were the final tip-off. ",
        "Ian: Michael? ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. We need your help. He has my daughter. ",
        "Jack: I still wouldn't trust this guy. This is his home, right? Meet his new \r\nroommate. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Ian: You knew about this? ",
        "Michael: Her name's Olivia. She and Caleb were to be married. Then she found \r\nout what he was. ",
        "Lucy: Wow, it's really a swell wedding present for a new bride, huh? ",
        "Michael: She wanted nothing to do with him and they fought. He killed her. \r\nBut he loved her. He couldn't part with her. ",
        "Kevin: Olivia. Livvie. Oh, my God. ",
        "Jack: Caleb wants Livvie to take Olivia's place. ",

        "",
        "Karen: I really think you should think this through. I thought you loved \r\nbeing a nurse. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, well, things change. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, people, too. ",
        "Frank: Does this have anything to do with your mystery man, the one you \r\ndumped my brother for? ",
        "Gabriela: You know, this has nothing to do with Caleb, ok? Nursing is a \r\nthankless job and I'm tired of it. So are you going to accept that or what? ",
        "Karen: You and Audrey should discuss this further. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, fine, I'll shove it under her door myself. Should've known \r\nbetter than to ask you for anything. ",
        "Frank: What is wrong with her? ",
        "Karen: I don't know. ",
        "Frank: It -- it's like she's become someone else. ",
        "Karen: No, Frank, it's like this whole hospital, this whole town has been \r\nturned upside down. ",
        "Alison: Hey. You guys, have you seen Gabriela? ",
        "Karen: Actually, you just missed her, which is probably just as well. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, why? What did she do? ",
        "Karen: She handed in her resignation. What did you think? ",
        "Alison: Oh. Uh, nothing. I -- she hasn't been acting like herself lately, so \r\nI didn't know. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you got that right. Well, I'm going to check on Emilio, all \r\nright? ",

        "Kevin: What did you give my daughter to protect her? ",
        "Michael: I'm sorry. I suspected Caleb had found someone new. I didn't know \r\nwho she was. ",
        "Kevin: Then help me find my daughter. Where would Caleb take her? ",
        "Michael: He could be anywhere. ",
        "Ian: He's not going to help you, Kevin. He's protecting his brother. The good \r\nfather has built a sanctuary in here for a monster. He's built a mausoleum for \r\nthe girl they killed! ",
        "Eve: Ian. ",
        "Ian: You knew what your brother was capable of and you knew that he was \r\nlooking for Olivia number two and that he was going after our baby, and you did \r\nnothing. ",
        "Michael: Because you all would've died trying to stop him. I'm the only one \r\nwho can. ",
        "Jack: Then why haven't you? ",
        "Michael: You've lived with this for what, Jack, a few weeks? I've lived with \r\nCaleb my whole life. You can't destroy him. He's got powers beyond your wildest \r\ndreams. But there is a small human side to him, and I think I can reach it. ",
        "Kevin: Well, while you're getting in touch with this animal's human side, \r\nwhat about my daughter? ",
        "Michael: I swear -- I swear to you, I'd do anything I can save her. And, Eve, \r\nI'd die before I let Caleb take your child. ",

I mean, you know, we've been thinking about it, but we -- \r\nwe don't want something that the other kids are going to make fun of. You know \r\nhow they like to make up rhymes, like \"Rob the slob\" or \"Dirk the jerk,\" you \r\nknow, and -- and I'm not going to let anyone -- anyone -- hurt this baby.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I know. Hey, you could go with a Mother Nature kind of name, you know, \r\nlike Oak or Tree or Pollen or Ocean Breeze. ",

Or maybe you didn't open your mouth because you're a coward. \r\nAnd I'm looking at you and I can see that. But now I'm thinking maybe you didn't \r\nopen your mouth because you wanted everything to play out the way that you'd \r\nplanned it. ",
        "Michael: What are you talking about? ",
        "Ian: You gave Eve a necklace to protect her, protect the baby. It wasn't \r\nthere to protect me, now was it? So maybe you were hoping that your brother \r\nwould come, take care of me, and you can have Eve all to yourself. ",
