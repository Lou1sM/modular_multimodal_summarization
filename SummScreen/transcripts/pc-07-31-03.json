        "For Christina's benefit, Ian officially invites Kevin to join them on the picnic, and Kevin accepts the invitation. Jamal asks Imani out for pizza, and she agrees on the condition that he let her treat him. Alison is annoyed with Rafe for giving Caleb the go-ahead to play at their fashion show. Olivia doesn't like the idea either, but Caleb assures her that everything will be all right. Alison becomes angrier to hear Rafe talk about the necessity of finding the ring, but Rafe maintains that no one can have a normal life unless he can keep the ring out of Caleb's hands. Alison doesn't want Caleb's band at their show, and she would rather not have the show at all. She reluctantly agrees not to cancel it, since so many people are looking forward to it. Caleb takes Olivia to the Pizza Shack, where he explains that his father's voice validated much of what he already knew. The music is the key to getting his ring back, which is why he wants to play the gig at the fashion show. He will use his new song to ensure that whoever has the ring will bring it to him, and he intends to make that person pay a heavy price. Christina thoroughly enjoys the outing with her mommy, daddy, and Ian. She takes pictures of them and runs off to see a bunny that passed by earlier. As Christina sits alone by the edge of the river, she reaches into the water and pulls out Caleb's ring."

        "Alison: Wait a second, let me get this straight -- you do think that this is a good idea for Caleb's band to play at our fashion show?",
        "Rafe: No, not just a good idea. It's a great idea.",
        "Caleb: Smart man.",
        "Alison: Stop. What's going on here? You guys are up to something. What is it? Tell me, please?",
        "Caleb: Is fair-hair always this paranoid?",
        "Rafe: Look, we have a truce, right?",
        "Caleb: Truce, absolutely.",
        "Rafe: Right, so we made our peace. Right now, making this gym succeed is our number one priority. And the way I see it, having the band play could only be good for business.",
        "Caleb: I think it's good for both of us.",
        "Rafe: Right, good for --",
        "Livvie: What is good for both of us?",
        "Caleb: Well, the band is going to perform our new single at their fashion show next week.",
        "Livvie: Really? I think that's the worst idea I've ever heard.",
        "Alison: I'm sure I will regret saying this, but for once I agree with Livvie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal's voice: I know, it can be kind of dangerous being able to have anything you want. No, this is safer this way.",
        "Jack: Well--",
        "Jamal: Gone.",
        "Jack: There you go. The current will probably take it out to the sea.",
        "Jamal: Stupid piece of metal. I'm glad I drowned that thing. Mess with me, Jack? Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: Daddy can come to our picnic, huh, mommy?",
        "Lucy: I hadn't thought about that, exactly.",
        "Kevin: You know what, honey, that is so nice of you to invite me to go on your picnic, but I have lots and lots to do today, so why don't you go along and have a great time with mommy and Ian, and you and I will have a special picnic sometime soon.",
        "Lucy: That's a very nice idea, pumpkin head. You know, you and daddy could have a great, special picnic, just the two of you.",
        "Christina: But what if it rains?",
        "Kevin: Oh, honey, we'll just pick another day, that's all.",
        "Lucy: And, you know, I guess there's always tomorrow.",
        "Ian: We don't know that. No guarantees for that.",
        "Lucy: That's very generous.",
        "Ian: The child wants her dad. I think she should have that.",
        "Kevin: Look, I really don't think that's necessary.",
        "Ian: I'm extending an invitation to you to join us on our picnic.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Hey, pumpkin head, what is this face? Come here! Did you hear what we get to do? Daddy's coming, Ian's coming, I'm going, and tiger's going. We're all going on the picnic together. Do you want to do that? Ok, come on, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Uh-oh, where's Christina?",
        "Christina: Look, mommy, it's a tent.",
        "Lucy: A tent? I can't find Christina. Where could she be?",
        "Ian: We can't eat until we put this down.",
        "Kevin: Christina? Going to get you!",
        "[Kevin growls]",
        "[Christina giggles]",
        "Kevin: There you go, it's all yours.",
        "Lucy: Oh, don't let her wander off, ok?",
        "Kevin: I'm way ahead of you.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. All right, this is -- it's going.",
        "Ian: No, this is great.",
        "Kevin: Ok, the good news is I can still outrun her.",
        "Lucy: Good. Uh-oh. Oh, no. What are you doing? Cheese.",
        "Kevin: Hey. I didn't know you were a photographer!",
        "Christina: Ian showed me how!",
        "Lucy: Yes, he did.",
        "Kevin: He did? Oh, that's great.",
        "Lucy: It is. It's --",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: It's great. He taught her how to take pictures, and you're teaching her how to draw, and I am giving her impeccable style taste kind of tips, and so I have the most artistic little girl in all of Port Charles. Don't I, don't I, don't I? What?",
        "[Christina whispers]",
        "Lucy: Ok, we have a request from the person on my lap for the three of us to be in a picture together, with me in the middle. Ok, let's try it. You want us to move over by that log?",
        "Kevin: Ok, yeah.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Christina: Mommy, bunny!",
        "Lucy: Uh-oh, I'm on it. Bunny! Can you finish setting up?",
        "Ian: Sure.",
        "Lucy: All right.",
        "Ian: Ahem.",
        "Kevin: I think it's time for some wine.",
        "Ian: Yep.",
        "Kevin: So, whatever possessed you to invite me to this thing, anyway?",
        "Ian: Well, your daughter wanted you here.",
        "Kevin: Well, here's to making the best of a bad situation.",
        "Lucy: Hey, pumpkin head. You can't just wander off like that even though you see a bunny, ok, because mommy worries, and it's not really, really that safe down here by the river, ok? So let's not do that again. Stick with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Well, that has to be the most self-serving idea I've ever heard. The only one who gets anything out of him performing at your place is you.",
        "Rafe: You know what, for once, I wish you would just think about it before you open your big mouth.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, of course you'd stick up for Alison.",
        "Alison: Wait, why me? What are you talking about me for?",
        "Livvie: Well, this is obviously your brilliant idea.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. I actually hate this idea.",
        "Livvie: Oh, then whose is it?",
        "Caleb: Mine. I approached her.",
        "Alison: And I approached Rafe on it, and I didn't expect in a million years that you would actually go for something like that.",
        "Rafe: It's just some music for the fashion show, ok?",
        "Livvie: \"Just some music\"? You should be falling all over yourselves to get someone as good as Caleb performing at your cheesy fashion show.",
        "Alison: This is going to get very complicated. Don't you see that?",
        "Caleb: Look, hey, you know what, it doesn't have to get complicated. Relax. In the end, it's my call where we play and where we don't play.",
        "Rafe: And I think it'll be fine. It'll all work out. You know, we can keep it simple, right?",
        "Caleb: Simple? You bet.",
        "Rafe: Then let's go with it.",
        "Caleb: I'll have my people call you with some arrangements.",
        "Rafe: Great.",
        "Alison: Hey, hey, hey. Rafe, wait, I want the truth.",
        "Rafe: What truth?",
        "Alison: What is going on? Look, we both know that the success of our fashion show doesn't depend on whether or not Caleb's band's going to play.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah? Come here. Come here.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: Why'd you come to me with the proposal then?",
        "Alison: Because I wanted him to see how serious we were when we told him to get lost. What is it? What's going on?",
        "Rafe: That's what I intend to find out.",
        "Alison: Great, here we go. You're totally falling into your old ways again. Why are you doing this? You cannot resist the game.",
        "Rafe: No, Alison, you know what, it's not a game. It never was. But you are right about one thing -- Caleb is up to something.",
        "Alison: I thought you guys had an agreement.",
        "Rafe: Look, I'm trying. I know I promised you I would avoid him. I was even telling Lucy a little earlier that I owed you a life without Caleb. But then in he walks, right, and not alone. He's brought here by you. So you tell me, how do I avoid that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Ok, Caleb, what is going on in that head of yours?",
        "Caleb: It has been a very productive day.",
        "Livvie: Ok, well, why don't you tell me about it?",
        "Caleb: You like what I do?",
        "Livvie: Yeah.",
        "Caleb: This?",
        "Livvie: Mm-hmm. But listen, I really need to know --",
        "Caleb: Hey, I promise you, it's going to be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Oh, sorry.",
        "Ian: Go ahead.",
        "Kevin: No, no, no. Go ahead, take it.",
        "Ian: You applied to be reinstated at the hospital then?",
        "Kevin: Oh, yeah, yeah. You? You working up to a full schedule or --",
        "Ian: Yeah, I'm just part-time now.",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: Takes a while.",
        "Lucy: Alison told me that you -- you volunteered to paint the scenery for the fashion show. That's nice.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well --",
        "Lucy: George. That George guy, he's an interesting fellow.",
        "Kevin: Kind of an artist's prerogative, isn't it?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, it's kind of weird because he claims he knows me and he looks really familiar to me. There's something about him that is very familiar.",
        "Kevin: I don't remember you mentioning him from your designer days.",
        "Ian: Designer days?",
        "Lucy: I -- I played at it, tried.",
        "Kevin: No, don't sell yourself short. She was brilliant.",
        "Lucy: I was ok.",
        "Kevin: Seems I recall you wanted to design a line of children's clothes, too, didn't you?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I did, for Serena and Christina. They were kind of my inspiration. But then when Christina was taken away, I -- I couldn't, I couldn't do it.",
        "Kevin: Want some more chicken?",
        "Ian: No, I'm good. What about some bread or something?",
        "Kevin: No, really, I'm stuffed. Couldn't eat another.",
        "Lucy: Wine?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: Oh, yeah, yeah.",
        "Lucy: Ok. There you go. Ah, and some for you.",
        "Kevin: Thank you.",
        "Kevin: That's because we're on our third glass, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Well, \"fun\" is too strong a word, but, you know, I could call it almost kind of having fun -- here.",
        "Ian: All right, enough of this. Hands up, who's really having a good time here?",
        "Christina: I'm having fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Jamal: I should have known you were a dancer.",
        "[Imani scoffs]",
        "Imani: Hardly. Although I wanted to a long time ago.",
        "Jamal: Well, you're very -- you're very graceful with the leg and -- flexible. You see I'm very experienced at giving compliments, huh?",
        "Imani: No. No, I'm just so out of shape, you know?",
        "Jamal: Hmm.",
        "Imani: But yoga's really helping me.",
        "Jamal: Oh, yoga? Right.",
        "Imani: Yeah. Obviously, I'm really not good at taking compliments, so thank you.",
        "Jamal: My pleasure. You -- I think you should --",
        "Imani: Um -- have you tried yoga?",
        "Jamal: I can't say that I have, but I've done some stretching.",
        "Imani: No, it's really, really amazing. You know, it pulls together the whole mind-body connection, you know?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I can imagine.",
        "Imani: Which is really great sometimes if you're not really feeling comfortable in your body.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to hear more about that sometime. That would be cool. Maybe over that smoothie that we talked about.",
        "Imani: Ooh. You think you're ready to handle it now, huh?",
        "Jamal: I'm ready. I'd like to know more about feeling comfortable in your body.",
        "Imani: Really?",
        "Jamal: Oh, wait. Forget I said that. I didn't even mean it like that.",
        "Imani: No, that's cool. I think I know what you meant.",
        "Jamal: Alright, well, make it dinner then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: That was Caleb's idea and he came to me. It wasn't the other way around.",
        "Rafe: I know, I know. But here's the thing -- it doesn't matter how it happened, it happened.",
        "Alison: Isn't this supposed to be, like, separate? They're supposed to have their lives and we're supposed to have our lives?",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm, I know, normal, right?",
        "Alison: Yes, normal. But I don't think Caleb's band playing at our show is normal at all, and I don't want to do it.",
        "Rafe: Well, then I guess you shouldn't have asked for my opinion.",
        "Alison: Oh, I guess I shouldn't have asked for your opinion. That's fine. I don't want to do this show at all.",
        "Rafe: Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Alison: Hey, look, let me tell you something, ok? I'm just trying to convey something to you. Having a line of our own clothing is not worth stirring up trouble with Caleb. So if this place is going to be a success, then that's fine, we'll go ahead and we will struggle a little bit if that's what we have to do. We've done it before, we can do it again.",
        "Rafe: Ok, do you think that's the answer? Do you really think that's the answer? I mean, if it doesn't happen here, it's going to happen someplace else. Do you know that the base of the promise that we made to each other is the idea that we weren't going to let Caleb get in the way of us doing anything that made us happy, right?",
        "Alison: I know. But you opened up the door and invited him in.",
        "Rafe: You know, keep your friends close, enemies closer.",
        "Alison: All the more reason to cancel. I'm serious.",
        "Rafe: Wait a second. I mean, you said it yourself, this show has taken on a life of its own, right? I mean, and people are invested in this, especially your mother, and that's all because of you.",
        "Alison: Right. Ok, so there's always a price to pay, isn't there? It's never easy.",
        "Rafe: I guess not. Look, I'm trying. I am trying to keep this promise that we made to each other. But you know what, this is bigger than us. I mean, the fact is Caleb is a vampire and I am a slayer. And no matter what truces we make with each other, none of that matters until we find that ring and we make sure that it's safely out of Caleb's hands.",
        "Alison: Oh, god --",
        "Rafe: Until then, there's going to be no normal, not for anyone.",
        "Alison: Here we go with the ring again. Again, Rafe. Come on.",
        "Rafe: This ring -- it's our biggest threat right now. So we got to keep Caleb where we can see him. So we have him do the show. So what. So he might surprise us. You know, he might just put on a regular gig. But you know what, if my instincts are right, something's going down. And if it's going to happen, I'd rather it happen here, where we can do something about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Ok, cough it up. I want some info.",
        "Caleb: There's not much to tell, really.",
        "Livvie: Try again. Your band, a multimillion-dollar act, is debuting their new single at Alison's cheesy fashion show.",
        "Caleb: Don't jump to conclusions.",
        "Livvie: Well, what am I supposed to think? Somehow, it always comes back to Alison.",
        "Caleb: When are you going to trust me when I say she means nothing to me and you are everything?",
        "Livvie: So you're not just doing charity work. Then what's in it for us?",
        "Caleb: In a strange way, playing the cheesy fashion show is the next step in getting the ring back.",
        "Livvie: Does this have anything to do with what happened to you in the woods, in the fire?",
        "Caleb: Yes.",
        "Livvie: Ok, well, you didn't quite tell me what happened.",
        "Caleb: It was my father's voice. And it validated much of what I already knew. The music is the key to getting what I want. It draws people to me.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, it does. I've seen it and I've felt it.",
        "Caleb: So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to draw the holder of the ring right into our arms.",
        "Livvie: So this is what you were planning all along? Why didn't you tell me? There's more, isn't there?",
        "Caleb: There is more. I was also reminded of how generous I have been lately to these mortals. Sound familiar?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, it does. I think I've said the same thing to you.",
        "Caleb: So I have a plan now. Whoever has the ring will bring it to me, and then --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: I want to go see the bunny.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Ok. But listen, stay right where I can see you, ok? Don't wander off. I'll be watching you.",
        "Kevin: She's the reason I'm here. I love that little girl and I cherish every breath she takes. Having said that, I'd rather be anywhere else on earth.",
        "Ian: Oh, me, too.",
        "Lucy: I'm having the time of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: Dinner is big, you know, and it's not really like a smoothie, is it?",
        "Jamal: Ok, look, it's not big, ok? It's just pizza. Pizza, maybe a smoothie --",
        "Imani: Pizza?",
        "Jamal: But pizza.",
        "Imani: I do. I do like pizza.",
        "Jamal: And you can have it any way you want -- vegetarian, the works, pepperoni.",
        "Imani: Ok.",
        "Jamal: All right?",
        "Imani: Ok. But on one condition.",
        "Jamal: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Imani: I'm buying. I owe you.",
        "Jamal: If you insist.",
        "Imani: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Hey. You know I'm making sense.",
        "Alison: I know. What I'm --",
        "Imani: Oh, hey. You guys know that everybody's talking about this fashion show?",
        "Rafe: Yes, I know.",
        "Imani: So I'll see you guys there.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Imani: And don't worry, I will make sure that there's plenty of food this time.",
        "Alison: All right, yeah. Ok, bye.",
        "Imani: Bye.",
        "Alison: Ok, fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, we won't cancel this. I don't want to disappoint anybody else.",
        "Rafe: What about not disappointing yourself?",
        "Alison: Look, I want this to be a success, Rafe, I really do.",
        "Rafe: All right, well, then just think about it, ok? Maybe Caleb's big old plan will turn out to be nothing, and then it'll be good for us anyway.",
        "Alison: I know, but with Caleb, there's always the next plan.",
        "Rafe: I know. I know, but you got to know I'm watching out after us.",
        "Alison: I know you are. I'm just -- I mean, I'm worried. I'm worried about the time when it's going to be more than we can handle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: The Stephen Clay Experience is going to play a brand-new song that I'm just putting the finishing touches on.",
        "Livvie: Oh. And that's how you're going to get the ring.",
        "Caleb: And that's it. I'm going to draw in the holder of the ring, and once I've gotten it back, then they are going to pay a heavy price.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Christina? Hey, pumpkin head, you need to get back over here to the picnic blanket.",
        "Christina: So pretty. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alison: Oh, Rafe, you really shouldn't have.",
        "Rafe: If I thought to send you flowers, I would have sent you 10 dozen, but I didn't. I didn't send them.",
        "Caleb: As long as that ring is in somebody else's hands, anything could happen.",
        "Christina: I wish mommy and daddy could kiss, too."
