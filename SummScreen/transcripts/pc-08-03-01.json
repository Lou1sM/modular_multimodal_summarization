        "Ian: Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Why are you packing your medical bag? ",
        "Ian: I'm going to make sure we have enough of everything because we're \r\ngetting out of here. And no argument from you, please. ",
        "Eve: Are you sure this is the right thing for us to do? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I do. I never thought I'd say this -- and God strike me down for \r\nsaying it now -- but rumor has it there's a vampire roaming around Port Charles, \r\nand I'm not taking any chances. ",
        "Eve: So we just run away? ",
        "Ian: My da taught me how to fight anyone except women and vampires, so here \r\nwe are. ",
        "Eve: Ok. So we -- we take this seriously. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: And we don't take any chances. So where are we going? ",
        "Ian: I'm going to the one place I know with enough goodness to protect us \r\nall. ",
        "Eve: Tirama Island. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. The only place in the world where our son will be safe. ",
        "Eve: Where we'll all be safe. ",
        "Ian: I hope so. God, I hope so. ",
        "",
        "Jack: No, Alison, go to the next one. That's not it. ",
        "Alison: Jack, do you want to do this? ",
        "Jack: Sorry. Go ahead. ",
        "Alison: Standing over me isn't going to make this modem go any faster. ",
        "Jack: Ok, well, how many maison de la noces can there be, huh? ",
        "Jamal: All right, just hang on, ok? We'll find out where Caleb's got Livvie. \r\nWe will. ",
        "Jack: When? Huh, Jamal? After he turns her into some bloodsucking killer? ",
        "Jamal: Jack, chill. Ok, we got a complicated program right here running on \r\nlast year's equipment. Ok, why don't you go in the alley and pace or -- break \r\nsomething out there? Look, we're checking all the search engines, all right? If \r\nthere's a match anywhere in the web, trust me, Ali will find it, ok? ",
        "Jack: Jamal, we're running out of time. I can feel it. ",
        "Jamal: Look -- ",
        "Jack: I've got to get -- ah. ",
        "Jamal: Jack, just save your energy. You're going to need it for Caleb, ok?\r\n",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Look, I'm going to get some more to \r\neat. ",
        "Alison: Again? ",
        "Jack: Alison, would you get off my back please? Did you get some more of \r\nthose blood packets from the hospital? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, they're chilling. ",
        "Jack: Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, Jack, you know, you -- you've been putting a lot of that stuff \r\naway, more and more. ",
        "Jack: So? ",
        "Jamal: So -- so can your body handle it? ",
        "Jack: Look, how the hell do I know, Jamal? ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, hey -- ",
        "Jack: All that matters is me getting strong to fight Caleb. All right? Saving \r\nLivvie's life -- that's all that counts. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: No. Mama, don't, please, or I'm going to start crying, too. ",
        "Rachel: I just can't help it. You look so beautiful. ",
        "Livvie: I am so glad that you're here. ",
        "Rachel: Thank you. Thank you for the most incredible gift you can give a \r\nmother. Oh, and speaking of gifts, Caleb left you something. Something special \r\nfor his bride on a special day. ",
        "Livvie: What is it? ",
        "Rachel: I don't know. Open it up. ",
        "Rachel: Oh. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, gosh. Mama, look how beautiful. ",
        "Rachel: Oh, you deserve this, sweetheart. You know, your husband -- he knows \r\nthat it takes someone special with grace to sparkle as brightly as this does. He \r\ncould just shower you with diamonds and you'd still be the rarest gem of all.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh, look at me, Mama. It's my wedding day. ",
        "Rachel: Yes, sweetheart. And now you're ready. ",

        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: You hungry maybe? ",
        "Kevin: Haven't had time to think about it. ",
        "Lucy: You have to eat. Obviously, things aren't going so well. ",
        "Kevin: It's not going at all. Caleb could've taken Livvie any one of a \r\nthousand places, and it will take me days to go through these documents we took \r\nfrom the monastery. ",
        "Lucy: It's ok. I think we have some time here. I have a feeling about that.\r\n",
        "Kevin: But how much time, Lucy? A week? An hour? ",
        "Lucy: What are you doing? Where are you going? ",
        "Kevin: I'm going to find Jack and see if there's anything more to go on. ",
        "Lucy: No, you're not. Jack said he would call us. He'd come find us if he had \r\nanything. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Lucy: You're not just going to sit -- please. ",

        "Kevin: Hi, Victor. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Victor: Something terrible. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Victor: I went out this morning to put some flowers on Abe Kurland's grave, \r\nbut he wasn't there. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Victor: It -- it was all dug up, and -- and the lid of his coffin had been \r\nbroken open. ",
        "Kevin: And the judge wasn't there. ",
        "Victor: Somebody stole the body? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. Oh -- ",
        "Kevin: No one stole anything, Victor. ",
        "Victor: What do you mean? ",
        "Kevin: Abe took off on his own. ",
        "Victor: What -- what are you saying? ",
        "Kevin: You better sit down, Victor. ",
        "Lucy: And you're going to need some water to drink. ",
        "Victor: I don't want some water. What -- ",
        "Lucy: Well, you'll need it. Here, take this. ",
        "",
        "Abe: The rings are exquisite. ",
        "Caleb: Wait till you see the bride. You know, I've waited lifetimes for the \r\nperfect moment, perfect woman to have a family with. And having you join our \r\nextended family has made this an even happier day, Judge Kurland. ",
        "Abe: Thank you, Caleb. I've performed thousands of weddings in my time, but I \r\ncan't tell you how much I'm looking forward to this one. ",
        "Caleb: You sure you're up to it? ",
        "Abe: Never felt better, especially for a dead man. ",
        "Caleb: You know, it's -- it's nice to know that death is just a figure of \r\nspeech in our world, isn't it, Judge? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Hey, sweetheart. Any luck? ",
        "Alison: How's Jack? Is he doing any better? ",
        "Jamal: No, not in my opinion. ",
        "Jack: Anything new? ",
        "Alison: No, no -- oh, Jack. Please, will you -- ",
        "Jack: What? What the hell -- what the hell's her problem? ",
        "Jamal: Why don't you slow down a little bit? You're starting to guzzle this \r\nstuff. ",
        "Jack: Hey, Jamal, I know the more I drink, the stronger I get. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know that. ",
        "Jack: And it's all about Livvie now. ",
        "Jamal: I know, but you can't keep guzzling this stuff -- ",
        "Jack: Look, Jamal, if I keep drinking this, I'll be able to handle Caleb. I \r\ngot to save Livvie's life! ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok, ok. ",
        "Jack: What? ",

        "Livvie: Mama, it's already perfect. Come on. ",
        "Rachel: Just one more time. There. Oh, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: No. Mama, don't. Please, not again. ",
        "Rachel: Don't worry, I won't. It's just that I am so happy. Honey, this is \r\nwhat I always wanted for you -- to find a wonderful man that would keep you \r\nsafe, give you everything you ever wanted and more, to love you beyond your \r\ndreams of true love. Oh, sweetheart, it's all right there just waiting. You go \r\nout there and you grab it and you hold on tight and never let go. You hear me?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yes. Mama, I hear you. ",

        "Rachel: Well -- I guess it's time. Your new life, eternal love. ",
        "Caleb: Olivia. ",
        "Caleb: There isn't a woman in all the world with even half your beauty, half \r\nyour soul, beyond my wildest dreams. You sure you're ready? ",
        "Livvie: If you'll have me. ",
        "Caleb: There's just one more thing you need to know before we can start. For \r\nyou to be my wife, for us to live together through the ages bound as one in an \r\neverlasting covenant, you must become as I am. ",
        "Livvie: As you are. ",
        "Caleb: For that to happen, you must leave your world and enter mine. It's \r\ntime for you to come to me, Olivia. It's time for you to cross over to the other \r\nside. ",
        "Livvie: The other side. ",
        "Caleb: Look at me. Look into my eyes. Are you sure you understand what I'm \r\nsaying? ",
        "Livvie: Understand. Of course, my love. You're telling me I must die.",

        "Victor: But the evidence was all around me. ",
        "Kevin: Evidence? What evidence? ",
        "Victor: Abe. Abe. Everything he did, everything that happened to him from the \r\nmoment he came in from the woods. I should've been able to see the symptoms. ",
        "Kevin: From where, old movies? ",
        "Victor: No, from the time I was stationed in eastern Europe. We heard a lot \r\nof stories, we all did, but, of course, no one would admit believing any of \r\nthem. Except I always thought all of the locals all telling the same stories -- \r\nthere's got to be some truth in -- my God -- vampires in Port Charles? ",
        "Lucy: Yep, and the worst kind. ",
        "Kevin: What kind is that? ",
        "Lucy: The out-of-their-minds kind. ",
        "Kevin: The worst of it is, Victor, he has Livvie. ",
        "Victor: What? Monk! ",
        "Kevin: He's lured her off somewhere. ",
        "Victor: To kill her? ",
        "Kevin: To marry her. ",
        "Victor: Well, we -- we've got to find her! ",
        "Kevin: Well, we're open to suggestions! I mean, what did the villagers in \r\neastern Europe do when they had to crash a vampire wedding? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, Doc, I -- I have something I've been needing to tell you. Um, \r\nsomething about the wedding you really need to know. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: In order for Livvie to be Caleb's bride, he has -- he has to turn her.\r\n",
        "Kevin: You mean into a vampire? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Victor: It's not going to happen. Not to my granddaughter. Not while I can do \r\nanything about it. ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: What you're saying to me is that my daughter's wedding is actually her \r\nfuneral, is that it? So if we don't find them and stop them, Livvie will die.\r\n",

        "Livvie: A child? ",
        "Caleb: \"Dying\" is a -- is a word used by people who don't understand the \r\npossibilities. To sad and ordinary souls, it's the end. But to the \r\nextraordinary, it's just the beginning. A second birth. With one last breath, \r\nwe're born again into a new and vibrant way of life filled with power and \r\nknowledge, with all senses working at the highest level. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb. ",

        "Livvie: Yes. Please. ",
        "Caleb: But to walk by my side, Olivia, you must say goodbye to this mortal \r\nlife. You must surrender to a peaceful sleep. But when your blood mixes with \r\nmine, you'll wake up in a world where anything is possible, and we'll be soul \r\nmates, you and I, forever. ",
