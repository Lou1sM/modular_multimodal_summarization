        "While painting at the gym with Kevin, Christina wishes that she could paint as well as her daddy. Kevin is amazed to see her wonderful new artwork. When Lucy admits that she kissed Kevin, Ian goes into denial, thinking that it couldn't possibly have happened. He fills her in on the research to restore his mortality. When Kevin arrives with Christina, Ian takes the little girl outside so that Kevin and Lucy can speak privately. Although Lucy denies that the kiss meant anything, Kevin knows that something is happening between them. Alison is appalled to see that she and Caleb made the front page of the morning paper. Olivia seems to take the photo better than expected, but Caleb doesn't know that she's plotting her revenge against Alison. Against her better judgment, Alison agrees to let Olivia be a model in the fashion show. She asks Caleb not to hurt anyone, but he is prepared to do what it takes to get his ring back."

        "Lucy: Please come home. Please? Come home, come home. I need to tell you. I just want to talk about it, and then maybe it'll feel ok.",
        "Lucy: Ugh.",
        "Ian: Hey!",
        "Lucy: Hey. I missed you.",
        "Ian: Oh, I missed you.",
        "Lucy: I called you four times and you didn't call me back --",
        "Ian: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: So I wondered why.",
        "Ian: I was in the lab, I was working, and I -- we came up with something. I got to tell -- where are the kids?",
        "Lucy: Carmen has Danny in the park, and Christina's with Kevin.",
        "Ian: With Kevin? Alone?",
        "Lucy: I thought it would be ok. They enjoy being together.",
        "Ian: All right, but you told me that --",
        "Lucy: I know, and I think that still and I worry, but I think it's going to be -- it's fine.",
        "Ian: Fine, is it? Well, are you -- I mean --",
        "Lucy: The word is \"fine.\" That's what I said -- everything is fine, and it's fine.",
        "Ian: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on? Talk to me, all right?",
        "Lucy: I kissed him.",
        "Ian: You kissed who?",
        "Lucy: Kevin. I kissed Kevin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: You're happy.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I always am when I'm with you, honey.",
        "Christina: Mommy, too?",
        "Kevin: Yep, and with mommy, too. You know what? I've got to go clean these brushes off. Are you going to be ok here for a few minutes? You'll stay right here? Ok. I'll be right back.",
        "[Kevin whistles]",
        "Christina: Now I can whistle, too.",
        "[Whistle]",
        "Christina: I wish I could paint as good as daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You know what? You might want to slow down. I mean, I'm sure it'll be ok. The show's not till tonight. We've been at it since dawn.",
        "Alison: I know, I know, I know, but I still have, like, a thousand things that I still need to do. My list, it is not done.",
        "Rafe: Ok, there's something that's not on that list that you really need right now. Ok, no arguments, all right? I'm going to get you some breakfast. You grab a chair. I'll toast you up a bagel, get you some coffee, juice. A paper here.",
        "Alison: What is it?",
        "Rafe: Hmm.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Hi.",
        "Caleb: Hi, beautiful.",
        "Livvie: Hmm --",
        "[Livvie giggles]",
        "Livvie: What was that for?",
        "Caleb: I need a reason now to kiss my girl?",
        "Livvie: No, but I --",
        "Caleb: But what?",
        "Livvie: I -- I don't know. You just seem a little tense or something. Is there anything wrong? Are you all right? Alison? Is it Alison? Is she bothering you?",
        "Caleb: No. It's got nothing to do with Alison. It's got everything to do with this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: What do you mean, you -- you kissed Kevin? I'm -- what did he do?",
        "Lucy: No. He didn't do anything. I kissed him. But it didn't mean anything, and I don't know how -- I don't know why it happened. I don't know really what happened, but it did, and I stayed up all night thinking I wasn't going to tell you because I don't want to hurt you or make you think it meant anything, but then I knew I can't keep anything from you because we can't have any secrets between us. I don't want that. And because you are the one person who sees inside my soul. I know if I kept this from you, that would be like putting up a wall, so, I don't want any secrets. That's why I just need you to say something back. Anything.",
        "Ian: No, I'm --",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Ian: No secrets, huh? You're right. We shouldn't have secrets from each other. Me, I'll tell you mine. I just realized just now that my greatest fear is losing you. I think I could face almost anything in this world as long as I'm with you. This -- well, god, this place is filled with angels and vampires. You're the only thing that makes me believe that any of this is real. I've known you a thousand years and I love you, and I know you love me, and we've been through so much. And now -- this kiss -- it doesn't fit anywhere. Doesn't fit. So, since it doesn't fit, it means it's not real. And if it's not real, that means it didn't happen, and that's good, because if it had happened, you wouldn't be the woman that I thought you were. And I'm not wrong about you. I'm not. I can't be.",
        "Ian: So, let's have lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: Look, daddy.",
        "Kevin: Honey, how did you do that? Well, this is really good. This is amazing! Remind me to tell your mother that we have to get you into some art classes real soon.",
        "Christina: Can we bring mommy to see?",
        "Kevin: Well, sure. I don't see why not. Ooh -- but right now I have to get you home, and I still have to change my clothes. I promised your mommy that we wouldn't be late. I mean, we don't want mommy to be mad at us, or you, but we know that would never happen because she loves you so much.",
        "Christina: She loves you, too!",
        "Kevin: Well, you'll have to talk to her about that. In the meantime, I have to get you home. She's probably already waiting for you. Bye, now.",
        "Christina: Bye.",
        "Rafe: Thanks for the help, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, this is so awful.",
        "Rafe: I --",
        "Alison: \"The Stephen Clay new squeeze\"?",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right, easy. Ok, ok. Easy.",
        "Alison: Ok, let me explain this. It's -- what if --",
        "Rafe: You know what? You don't have to, ok?",
        "Alison: No, please, I want to. I said -- I want to, I want to.",
        "Rafe: It's fine, really.",
        "Alison: I was -- I was just -- I was there and I spilled a drink on myself and I needed to borrow a shirt of his because I was soaking wet, and then I was just trying to, like, peek at his song, and it just -- Rafe, I'm sorry. Please talk to me. Hey.",
        "Rafe: Hmm? I was just waiting for you to finish explaining.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: I know that this isn't what it looks like.",
        "Alison: Of course you know that because you know me better than that. But this is so disgusting. How could somebody write something like that?",
        "Rafe: No. Look, it's just another of Caleb's attempts to get me all worked up.",
        "Alison: No, no, I don't think it is because he would have no idea that somebody was going to be there.",
        "Rafe: You keep believing whatever it is you want to believe, but I've been watching Caleb for a long time, and I know exactly what this kind of thing means.",
        "Alison: What do you mean, what it means?",
        "Rafe: Well, I've told you that I think he's up to something, right? Well, this is it, except this is just the beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You can't always believe what you read in the papers.",
        "Livvie: Of course not.",
        "Caleb: Of course not.",
        "Livvie: Yeah. That's how the press treats celebrities. They cook up all kinds of rumors and then start a bunch of stuff.",
        "Caleb: That's right.",
        "Livvie: Hey, that's the price I get for being with a big, sexy rock star like you.",
        "Caleb: Oh --",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on. Honey, what were you expecting?",
        "Caleb: From you? I guess I was sort of expecting the usual.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, the usual. No, not this time. Not anymore. No more meltdowns over Alison, because I think I finally realized you love me. I know, you love me, and there's nothing in this world that's going to come between us. I understand that now.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I'm -- I'm starting to think that you do realize that.",
        "Livvie: And I understand why you have to play at the fashion show tonight. It's not about Alison. It's about us and about you getting your ring back, and playing your new song is going to do that. I just -- I want to help any way I can. And if that includes eliminate --",
        "Caleb: I love you, maybe more in this moment than I ever realized. This is big for us.",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to pretend. You do know how I feel about Alison. I ju -- I realized that it has nothing to do with you unless I make it. And besides, I don't think anyone can get to you the way I do.",
        "Caleb: Nobody can. Nobody ever will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: We're going to need to talk about what -- yes -- what would happen --",
        "Ian: It's over, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: How is that possible?",
        "Ian: It's over. This conversation's over.",
        "Lucy: What just happened here?",
        "Ian: I've had this nightmare.",
        "Lucy: About me and Kevin?",
        "Ian: It's a terrible dream, you know.",
        "Lucy: It -- it doesn't mean anything. The kiss or him --",
        "Ian: In this dream, I finally realize what immortality really means. It means outliving you. It means outliving all the people I love.",
        "Lucy: That was your dream?",
        "Ian: I want to grow old with you. I want to watch you grow more beautiful every year. That's what I wanted to tell you when I came through that door, you know? That's what I wanted to say -- that Chris and I are working on a serum to bring back my mortality, because that's what I want.",
        "Lucy: That's what I want. More than anything I've ever wanted, I want us. Can't you understand that?",
        "Christina: Hey, mommy, we're home, me and daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ok, I knew there was going to be trouble as soon as we told Caleb that he was going to be a part of this fashion show.",
        "Rafe: There was going to be trouble whether we let him play or not.",
        "Alison: No. Maybe --",
        "Rafe: See, this way we can keep an eye on him and we'll be ready when it starts, all right?",
        "Alison: \"When it starts.\" I mean, isn't it unavoidable? I don't suppose maybe you could just sort of walk away from it.",
        "Rafe: Hmm. I don't think you really want me to do that, ok?",
        "Alison: Rafe, come on.",
        "Rafe: Just think about this, ok? Caleb got to come back here because I did. I'm here with you now because that kind of balance exists, ok, so it's my responsibility to make sure he's stopped, and that's exactly what I'm going to do, ok? And we're going get through tonight perfectly. It'll be fine, no matter what Caleb throws at us, all right? Come here.",
        "[Livvie chuckles]",
        "Caleb: Oh, it's nice to see the front page didn't ruin your big romance.",
        "Alison: Why are you guys here so early?",
        "Caleb: I like to do an early sound check when I play. It's part of the job.",
        "Livvie: So, Alison, about tonight -- the designer -- are they bringing in a bunch of models and stuff from out of town, or what's --",
        "Alison: No, no, I wanted to make it fun and kind of causal, so I asked some friends.",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, and you didn't ask me?",
        "Alison: No, I'm sorry. I thought that you would probably just decline, so --",
        "Livvie: Well, why don't you try me?",
        "Rafe: Livvie, what are you doing?",
        "Caleb: Hey, easy, Rafe. You know, I'm playing here for free. I think the least you could do is hear what she has to say. She's trying to help out.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'm serious here. I would really love to be a model in your fashion show.",
        "Alison: Livvie? Come on.",
        "Livvie: What's wrong, old friend? Are you afraid I might steal the show?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm really, really sorry.",
        "Christina: Can daddy have lunch with us?",
        "Kevin: You know, I would have knocked, but she just opened the door and --",
        "Lucy: It's all right. It's ok.",
        "Christina: Can daddy stay?",
        "Kevin: Actually, no, honey. I have a lot of work to do --",
        "Ian: No, why not? I think you guys still have a lot to talk about. Come on. What do you say we go play outside, huh?",
        "Christina: Ok.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: No secrets. And you're not wrong. So, how'd this morning go?",
        "Kevin: Amazing. Incredible, really. She -- she painted this amazing painting. I mean, really, you have to see it.",
        "Lucy: That's good. I'm very glad it went so well.",
        "Kevin: But that's not why Ian thought we should talk, not about Christina, is it?",
        "Lucy: No, it's not.",
        "Kevin: Well, ok. Out with it.",
        "Lucy: I really don't want to hurt you, and I just want to explain.",
        "Kevin: You kissed me, and now you're confused.",
        "Lucy: It did not mean anything. I hope you can understand that.",
        "Kevin: I understand that you stumbling around trying to hand me a load of bull is just that, because something did happen between us, Lucy, and we both know it.",
        "[Christina growls]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Come on, Livvie, what's really going on here?",
        "Caleb: Oh, Rafe. Paranoia is such an unattractive quality. May I have a banana?",
        "Alison: Livvie, why would you want to be in the fashion show here? I mean, especially with it being in our gym?",
        "Livvie: Well, Caleb is right. It just sounds like it would be a whole lot of fun.",
        "Rafe: Or maybe you really did get upset about this picture in the paper and you decided you didn't want to stay too far away from Caleb, right?",
        "Livvie: I always want to stick close to Caleb. I don't need any picture in the paper to make me do that.",
        "Caleb: Thank you, sweetheart.",
        "Livvie: You're welcome. Alison, I'm being serious with you. I want to be in this show. Are you going to let me model for you? Yes or no?",
        "Alison: Yeah -- no, that's fine. We can just figure out later what you will wear.",
        "Livvie: Excellent, that's perfect.",
        "Alison: I'm going to go check on the sound check.",
        "Caleb: Hey, you know what? I'll be right back.",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Caleb: I'm going to check on this, too.",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Ahem.",
        "Livvie: I can't wait. Can you?",
        "Rafe: Caleb set this up, right? This picture?",
        "Livvie: Rafe, believe it or not, Caleb doesn't sit up at night trying to think of ways to get at you.",
        "Rafe: Hmm.",
        "Livvie: And this would have been very hurtful to me, too, and he wouldn't do that, not intentionally. Now, why don't you tell me the truth.",
        "Rafe: Oh, ok, the truth about what?",
        "Livvie: You're worried about Alison, aren't you? You think your sweet little Ali has the hots for Caleb.",
        "Rafe: You know what? This conversation's over. It was really nice to talk to you.",
        "Livvie: Ok, then, bye-bye. You did go and see Caleb, and you were half undressed, and, no, Alison, it was not an accident. It's time for an accident of my own. Oh, yeah. This is going to be one hell of a fashion show.",
        "Alison: You know, look, I promised the crew -- they'll set it up when they get back. I think they're just probably on a break or something, ok?",
        "Caleb: No, they'll be back. Don't worry about it.",
        "Alison: Right, right. How am I really supposed to relax at all today, though, if Livvie is now in the fashion show?",
        "Caleb: She's trying, all right?",
        "Alison: I know. Yeah, she's trying. What happened to the vows that we all made?",
        "Caleb: Never going to happen.",
        "Alison: Right. This all started again because of this stupid ring.",
        "Caleb: Hey, you know, if you decide to do something like this again, give me a call, cause I know some better sound guys.",
        "Alison: Look, if you're planning on doing something, I'm just going to ask you honestly. Please don't hurt anyone, ok? I'm going to go check on the crew. Ok?",
        "Caleb: Hmm.",
        "[Caleb sighs]",
        "Caleb: Oh, Alison. You take something that doesn't belong to you and you're going to get hurt. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Kevin: Lucy, it was a kiss.",
        "Lucy: Fine. Whatever it was, it didn't matter.",
        "Kevin: Just who are you trying to convince of that?",
        "Rafe: I think something's going down with Caleb tonight.",
        "Livvie: At the end of little miss perfect's fashion show, she's going to get exactly what she deserves."
