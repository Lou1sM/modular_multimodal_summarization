        "With her new ring tucked out of sight, Christina makes a wish on a flower. When she wishes to go to the party, Ian tells her to come up with something else. She wishes for a ladybug, and one appears in her little hand. Lucy tries to make Kevin understand that their kiss didn't mean anything, but he wonders which one of them she's really trying to convince. He expresses concern about Ian's role in her life, and he worries that Christina will see his fangs someday. Lucy is prepared to deal with what it means to love a vampire. Ian eavesdrops for a moment and then joins them. Kevin and Ian talk Lucy into letting Christina go to the party for a little while. Caleb tells Olivia how proud he is of her, especially after the way she reacted to seeing the photo on the front page. He doesn't suspect that she's planning to take revenge on Alison. Elizabeth panics at the news that her check to the clothing manufacturer bounced. Because of this, there won't be any clothes for the fashion show. Fed up with her, Chris storms off, forcing her to deal with this on her own. Hearing that the clothes aren't ready, Alison sets out to call off the show, but Rafe is determined to let it happen. Elizabeth wants to rework some of Alison's workout clothes, but that idea doesn't pan out. Reese is confused by Jack's sudden desire to talk to her after wishing that she would back off. Casey's return startles Ricky, who thought that she was gone for good. Thinking that it was a mistake to come back, she decides to leave again. Reese wants to talk to Ricky about their own relationship, but he can't deal with that at the moment. Everyone is relieved when \"Georges\" arrives with the clothes after all. Caleb and Olivia are both prepared to move forward with their respective plans."

        "Jamal: Yeah, hold it steady and tie it tight, man.",
        "Jack: Jamal, man, I'm going to tie it tight.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know, but I don't want it falling down during the show.",
        "Jack: Like I do? Like I do? Look, I'm doing this for Alison, all right? It's not like I want to be hanging curtains, you know.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know. I'd just feel a lot better if Caleb wasn't a part of this.",
        "Alison: No, no.",
        "Rafe: Hey, calm down. It'll be ok.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm sure everything's going to be just dandy. I mean, I just asked Livvie to be in our fashion show, which I'm sure was such a plus, and plus the clothes aren't here, which means I have nothing to put on the models, and that's great.",
        "Rafe: You worried about Caleb?",
        "Alison: How can I not be worried about Caleb? I mean, you seem to be so convinced that something's going to happen tonight.",
        "Rafe: I'm just as convinced I can handle it, ok?",
        "Alison: You're right, I'm sure everything's going to be just fine. Right?",
        "Rafe: Yes.",
        "Alison: Caleb will be fine, I'm sure.",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Alison: My mother and Georges, they're going to be bringing the clothes, and then we're just going to have a really great show, right?",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, Chris, come on, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey. Sorry I'm late. Had trouble getting the damn wig on.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, put the accent on because there's people around.",
        "Chris: Oh, yes. [Foreign accent] Yes. Yes. Because tonight, there is no Chris, there's only Georges, and he's looking marvelous, much like George Michael during the Wham years. Yes.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, that's -- that's great. So where are the clothes?",
        "Chris: What, Georges is a delivery boy, too?",
        "Elizabeth: Come on, where are they?",
        "Chris: [Normal voice] Seriously, you don't have them?",
        "Elizabeth: They were supposed to be delivered to your apartment.",
        "Chris: Well, they weren't. All right, give me the number.",
        "Elizabeth: Call them. Find out what is going on, where they are. Jeez.",
        "Chris: [Foreign accent] Yes, hello. This is Georges. I am down at the gym, the Body and Soul, and I am looking for my creations, the clothes. Really? Really? [Normal voice] Really? [Foreign accent] Yes. Ok, thank you. No, that's fine. Ok, ciao.",
        "Elizabeth: What did he say? Do we have to go pick them up?",
        "Chris: [Normal voice] No.",
        "Elizabeth: What?",
        "Chris: They're not coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I do not want to keep going over this. I have so much to do with the fashion show and everything, I just need you to know what happened was simply -- it was just a little --",
        "Kevin: Kiss, Lucy. It was a kiss.",
        "Lucy: Fine. Whatever it was, it didn't matter. It didn't really happen in my mind, and now you need to know it didn't mean a thing and it's over.",
        "Kevin: So just who are you trying to convince of that, me or you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Christina. Look what I found for you. You can blow on this and make a wish.",
        "Christina: I wish to go to the party.",
        "Ian: Ah, don't wish for that. Your mother told you that party's for grownups only.",
        "Christina: I wish for a pet ladybug.",
        "Ian: All right, blow. Got to blow harder than that. I'll help you. Ah!",
        "Christina: Come see, come see! Look!",
        "Ian: Look at that. Ladybug landed right in your hand.",
        "Christina: My wish came true!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: So, are you excited about tonight?",
        "Caleb: You're not actually talking about the gig, are you?",
        "Livvie: No, I'm talking about getting your ring back.",
        "Caleb: I'm just angry with myself that I didn't think of this sooner. You know what? Remind me not to dabble in mortality any more.",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Caleb: You ok? You actually seem a little -- I don't know, nervous or something.",
        "Livvie: I'm fine. I'm just excited about you getting your ring back.",
        "Caleb: That's all?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's all. Why? I mean, what else would it be?",
        "Caleb: Nothing. You look beautiful. I got to check on something.",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Livvie: Somebody will pay tonight, Caleb, and that somebody might not be who you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: Can we show mommy my ladybug?",
        "Ian: Not right now. Your mommy's busy.",
        "Christina: With daddy, right?",
        "Ian: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I'm not trying to convince myself of anything at all. Oh. I am very happy that you are back to your old self again.",
        "Kevin: The man you married.",
        "Lucy: A lot -- a lot happened while you were gone.",
        "Kevin: Yeah. You had an affair with Ian.",
        "Lucy: I fell in love with Ian. I love him very much and I have moved on, and I want you to move on, too.",
        "Kevin: Because you care about me.",
        "Lucy: I do. I want you to be happy, especially for the girls' sake. I think we could try to --",
        "Kevin: Just be one big, happy family?",
        "Lucy: We could try, but you need to accept the fact --",
        "Kevin: The fact that things have changed, that Ian's the man you want to be with, and you desperately want me to accept that fact.",
        "Lucy: And you're being sarcastic.",
        "Kevin: I'm being honest, Lucy. You say you care about me? Well, I care about you. And Ian's a vampire. He's been able to keep it together so far, but what happens if he loses control? What happens if Christina sees his fangs? Have you thought what might happen to her, what that could do to her? Do you really want to live your life looking over your shoulder, wondering if today's the day that Ian will lose it? Do you really want to live your life like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Are you ready, Caleb? We're going to be late. You were reading?",
        "Caleb: I was just -- just reminding myself the history of my family. You're a part of that now.",
        "Livvie: I'm proud to be a part of your family.",
        "Caleb: And I'm proud of you. The way you reacted when you saw that photo in the paper, I --",
        "Livvie: You thought I was going to explode.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, there -- there was a time before when you would have.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, it took me long enough to figure out that Alison is no threat to me. Well, to us, I mean.",
        "Caleb: Sort of what I've been saying all along.",
        "Livvie: Can we not talk about Alison anymore?",
        "Caleb: I'm just going to put this away. I'll meet you outside?",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Caleb: All right. All right.",
        "Livvie: Ok, if I had any doubts before, they're all gone now. At the end of little Miss Perfect's fashion show, she's going to get exactly what she deserves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: What do you mean the check bounced? They're wrong! That is impossible. There's money in that account.",
        "Chris: Well, clearly, it wasn't enough. I mean, we have all these people, no clothes. My career -- my career's ruined.",
        "Elizabeth: Wait, your career?",
        "Chris: Well, you know what I mean -- his, Georges'.",
        "Elizabeth: No, what about Alison? She's got an entire production going on here tonight. I promised her!",
        "Chris: I have worked so hard to convince people that I'm Georges, and all for, what, so you could blow it by writing a lousy check?",
        "Elizabeth: Are you done moaning? Because we've got to figure something out here. We've got to come up with a solution.",
        "Chris: No, no, you know what? We don't. You do. Because I'm sick of bailing you out. I'm sick of being the chic designer, and I'm sick of being here.",
        "Elizabeth: No, Chris!",
        "Chris: No, I'm going.",
        "Elizabeth: No, don't go! What am I going to do?",
        "Alison: Hey. Rafe said that you were out here. Why don't you come inside?",
        "Elizabeth: I just needed to get some air.",
        "Alison: What do you mean? You never get air. What's wrong?",
        "Elizabeth: Nothing. Nothing I can't fix.",
        "Alison: What's wrong? The clothes? The clothes.",
        "Elizabeth: The clothes for tonight --",
        "Alison: The clothes aren't ready?",
        "Elizabeth: They're not ready. Can you believe that? That stupid manufacturer, they're not ready.",
        "Alison: Wait, are you telling me that the clothes are not even ready, they're not even here, so I don't have anything to put on my models tonight?",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, but I don't want you to worry about a thing. I just had a great idea.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, I can only imagine.",
        "Elizabeth: No, I can solve this.",
        "Alison: And I only thought that I had Caleb to worry about tonight. Great.",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, listen, Alison, this is not a problem. Sweetie, there is no disaster at hand.",
        "Alison: No, there's a big disaster. We have to call off the show.",
        "Elizabeth: No, we don't.",
        "Alison: Yes, we do. We don't have any clothes for the show tonight for all of the models.",
        "Rafe: What happened?",
        "Elizabeth: Nothing. It was just a little mix-up.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah, that figures.",
        "Elizabeth: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Rafe: Well, it just means, I'm sorry, but that's your M.O., right -- I mean, promise things you can't deliver?",
        "Alison: No, please, I just -- for once, I just wanted things to run so smoothly.",
        "Elizabeth: No, listen, Alison, I've got it under control. You have got a ton of workout clothes, ok? I can go upstairs, I can rework a few things.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Elizabeth: I can improvise. It'll work!",
        "Alison: No, it won't!",
        "Elizabeth: Yes, it will!",
        "Alison: We cannot do that for a designer fashion show. That's wrong on several levels.",
        "Jamal: All right, maybe we should just try it. I mean, we all have workout stuff.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, we can lower the lighting.",
        "Jack: I can get the applause going in the audience, a bit of cheering, you know.",
        "Rafe: I've got some clothes.",
        "Alison: I appreciate this, all of you, that's very nice, but, Rafe, we can't do this show. We have to call it off. It's done, absolutely.",
        "Jack: Alison, come on --",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Jack: So she's for sure, right? She's not going to change her mind, huh?",
        "Rafe: No, you heard her. She's serious, but we got to have it.",
        "Jamal: Well, maybe we should just postpone it.",
        "Rafe: No, we can't.",
        "Jamal: What?",
        "Rafe: Look -- I think something's going down with Caleb, tonight.",
        "Jamal: Oh. I was afraid of that.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, my gut tells me it has something to do with that lost ring of his.",
        "Jamal: I don't know. If you ask me, I bet that ring is long gone.",
        "Rafe: I don't think so.",
        "Jamal: Yeah?",
        "Rafe: The show's got to go on tonight no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Ooh, bad vibes in here.",
        "Ricky: Oh, relax. It's probably just nerves. I'm going to go set up the equipment, all right?",
        "Reese: Ok.",
        "Jack: Hey, Reese.",
        "Reese: Hi, jack.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, hold on one second.",
        "Reese: What?",
        "Jack: You ok?",
        "Reese: Yeah. But what's wrong with Alison? She looks really pissed off.",
        "Jack: Yeah, there's kind of been some drama here with the whole fashion show. But I was thinking maybe we could talk for a minute or something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: Hey, Alison. I have the food here from Elixir.",
        "Rafe: Imani, that's great. Not now, ok, please?",
        "Alison: No --",
        "Imani: Ok, what's wrong?",
        "Alison: Nothing. It's going to be just great. Thank you so, so much. We will have an abundance of food, but yet no show. So this will all be good.",
        "Rafe: Just give it a little time, all right?",
        "Alison: No, no.",
        "Jamal: Hey.",
        "Imani: Hi.",
        "Jamal: How you doing? Everything's handled?",
        "Imani: Yeah, it's good. We have so much food, but is the show really canceled?",
        "Jamal: Not as of yet. We're trying to work everything out.",
        "Imani: Good.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Imani: I don't want to miss seeing you strut your stuff on the catwalk.",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah, watch me. Yeah, keep laughing, huh? Laugh. That's ok. Cool. That's cool. You have a nice laugh, too.",
        "Imani: Oh, even if it's at your expense?",
        "Jamal: Doesn't matter. You're the one, you should be up there on that catwalk.",
        "Imani: Oh, that's not going to happen. That is not --",
        "Jamal: Why not? I mean, come on, you're a natural at it. I've watched you walk.",
        "Imani: I'm just happier out of the spotlight, that's all.",
        "Jamal: You're beautiful, strong, smart, a little shy, but it's not a bad combination if you ask me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to call up the people who were supposed to send the clothes. I'll just offer them a little extra money, all right? It'll be fine.",
        "Alison: No. Wait, wait, stop. Why are you so adamant about us doing a show tonight?",
        "Caleb: Congratulations. You made it to the big day. The place looks great.",
        "Alison: Thanks, Caleb.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, tonight will be a night we all remember.",
        "Alison: Well, right now, I would just settle for forgetting the whole thing.",
        "Caleb: Why? Did something happen?",
        "Rafe: It's just opening-night jitters.",
        "Caleb: Well, that's -- that's usually a good thing. It always works for me.",
        "Rafe: Really? That's funny, I can't really imagine you being nervous.",
        "Caleb: When the stakes are high enough.",
        "Rafe: Hmm. Is tonight one of those nights?",
        "Caleb: You never know. Hey, come on, relax. What could possibly go wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: This is the life that I want, it truly is, even with all the problems.",
        "Kevin: Problems? He's a vampire.",
        "Lucy: No! Don't. Please don't say that. I know what he is. I love him and I will deal with it. Ian and I will deal with it together. So I do not want to have this discussion again.",
        "Kevin: Good luck. I want you to be happy. You know that.",
        "Lucy: Then trust me on this.",
        "Ian: Hi.",
        "Lucy: Hey.",
        "Ian: Sorry if I'm interrupting. Christina found a ladybug and she wants to talk to her parents about going to the party tonight.",
        "Lucy: Ok, good on the ladybug. Doesn't have to be walked, you know, easy keeper. Um -- party? I -- well, I think it's kind of a grownup thing. I don't really want her to go.",
        "Kevin: Look, thanks for occupying her for a while.",
        "Ian: No problem.",
        "Lucy: Well, look at us.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, together again.",
        "Lucy: We were just trying to make the best of a very unusual situation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: So I try to get close to you and you're miserable. Then I try to give you some space and you're pissed off at me.",
        "Jack: No, just a little worried.",
        "Reese: About?",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. You know, I know you're over there hooking up with Garza, you know, hitting the sheets, stuff like that.",
        "Reese: Meaning?",
        "Jack: You know what I mean.",
        "Reese: Yeah, I think I do.",
        "Ricky: Who the heck set this up?",
        "Casey: Hey, you just kicked out your power source, man.",
        "Ricky: What? Whoa. Casey. Where have you been.",
        "Casey: Hey, man, I would've come back sooner. It's just you've been kind of busy with, uh --",
        "Ricky: Reese?",
        "Casey: Uh-huh.",
        "Ricky: Are you kidding me? We're just friends. Besides, last time I thought you were gone for good.",
        "Casey: Well, maybe I should've stayed there. I mean, it's not like you're in a corner, crying all by yourself, all alone, you know, right?",
        "Ricky: I love you, all right, but you can't expect me to just sit around and wait for you.",
        "Casey: Ricky, no, no, you know what, it's no biggie, really. I mean, you said yourself if you couldn't have me 100%, then I shouldn't even hang around, right? My bad.",
        "Ricky: Wait a minute, you didn't --",
        "Casey: It's a mistake. I know. I know, I know. This was wrong. You have a good life, ok, without me.",
        "Ricky: No, don't do -- damn!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: You sure this is ok?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah. I mean, even if -- even if it gets canceled, I mean, everyone still has to eat, right?",
        "Imani: Yeah. You know, Jack said it's on the house either way.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Imani: You guys have all been friends a long time.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we've been through a lot together.",
        "Imani: It's nice.",
        "Jamal: Well, there's always room for one more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Well, isn't it time for us to get into the clothes we're supposed to wear?",
        "Alison: Yes, we will do that in a couple of minutes, ok?",
        "Livvie: A couple of minutes? I thought you were really strict on keeping on schedule.",
        "Rafe: Livvie, just cool it, ok? Why don't I go upstairs and get the clothes, you know, like we talked about.",
        "Alison: No, no, I can't do this anymore. I can't do this.",
        "Caleb: What's going on?",
        "Rafe: There's nothing going on, all right?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I have tried to put together every combination that I can come up with.",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth, not now.",
        "Elizabeth: No, sweetheart, I went through your clothes, I went through Rafe's clothes --",
        "Caleb: Is there a problem?",
        "Rafe: No, there's not a problem.",
        "Elizabeth: It doesn't concern you.",
        "Caleb: I'm still concerned.",
        "Livvie: What is she talking about?",
        "Elizabeth: So short of painting the clothes on the models --",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth --",
        "Elizabeth: I'm so sorry, Alison, but I just don't think that this fashion show is going to happen.",
        "Livvie: But it has to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: But I don't want to stay home. I want to go to the party. I don't want to stay home with a babysitter.",
        "Lucy: Hey!",
        "Kevin: Hey.",
        "Lucy: Oh, I bet you're looking forward to playing with Carmen and Danny, huh, tonight? Yeah, yeah, yeah?",
        "Ian: Yeah, I think so, huh?",
        "Christina: But I don't want to stay home. I want to go to the party.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Well, you know, I told you, it's kind of a grownup sort of party.",
        "Christina: Please? I'll be good.",
        "Kevin: You know, Lucy, it's your call, but she did help paint for the show tonight, and it could be kind of fun to see all of her wonderful work up on display.",
        "Christina: Please? I'll be good. Please?",
        "Lucy: I --",
        "Kevin: Look, I can bring her home when she gets tired. An hour, maybe less. Come on.",
        "Lucy: I don't know, I don't know.",
        "Ian: I don't think it would hurt.",
        "Lucy: All right, then. Ok, an hour. That's all, ok?",
