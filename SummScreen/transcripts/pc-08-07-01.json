        "Eve: Damn you, Caleb! Stay away from my son! ",
        "Ian: Hey, it's ok. ",
        "Eve: No. No, it's not ok. He's here. ",
        "Karen: No one's going to hurt you. ",
        "Eve: He was here. He was here. He was right here. ",
        "Ian: You're just dreaming. ",
        "Eve: I'm not dreaming these contractions. I'm not dreaming that he's going to \r\ntake away our son. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. ",
        "Eve: He's going to take away our son. Ian, he wants our baby. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: You can't do this to me! Look, I have to get back to Caleb. ",
        "Jack: No, you don't know what you want. Caleb's got you under his spell --\r\n",
        "Livvie: No, Jack! ",
        "Lucy: I can't believe we did this! We left Doc with that monster. ",
        "Jack: That's what he wanted us to do, was get Livvie out of there. ",
        "Lucy: Jack, we left him with that bloodsucker. I can't believe we left him!\r\n",
        "Jack: Lucy, we have to go now. ",
        "Lucy: No! No! We are not going now. We're going to wait for him. We're going \r\nto wait for him. Oh, God. Doc, be ok. Please, God, make Doc ok. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: What? You're looking at me like you expect my head to be spinning or \r\nsomething. I'm just a guy in love. ",
        "Kevin: I know what you are. And you'll never get my daughter. ",
        "Caleb: I already got her. ",
        "Kevin: Right about now, she's getting on a plane back to Port Charles. ",
        "Caleb: Really? Aren't you wondering why maybe I'm not chasing after my bride?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Because she's not your bride. ",
        "Caleb: Because she'll come back to me on her own. ",
        "Kevin: My daughter would never willingly be with you. ",
        "Caleb: Why do I get the feeling that you don't approve of this marriage? ",
        "Kevin: You didn't count on me showing up, did you? ",
        "Caleb: Actually, I'm glad you're here. Gives me a chance to ask you properly \r\nfor your daughter's hand in marriage. So what do you say, Dad? Aren't you going \r\nto welcome me to the family? ",
        "",
        "Frank: It's all set. I just posted a guard outside Emilio's room. ",
        "Karen: Great. What about Gabby? ",
        "Frank: I checked her place, too. She hasn't been seen for a few days. ",
        "Karen: Just another crazy night in the E.R. A few accidents, injuries, and -- \r\noh, yeah, a vampire after my best friend's baby. ",
        "Frank: How's she holding up? ",
        "Karen: She's pretty freaked out. Who wouldn't be, under the circumstances?\r\n",
        "Frank: Vampires? You know, I can't even believe I'm saying the word. This is \r\nall so unreal. ",
        "Karen: Not to Eve. Caleb's really upsetting her. And I'm worried if she gets \r\ntoo worked up, she could go into premature labor. ",
        "Frank: Is it that bad? ",
        "Karen: I'm hoping Ian can calm her down. ",
        "",
        "Eve: This necklace isn't working the way Michael said it would, so we have to \r\nfind another way to protect our baby. ",
        "Ian: Just calm down, ok? ",
        "Eve: How can I calm down when there is something with this horrible, evil \r\nforce with powers that we don't know how to handle is taking over our lives? ",
        "Ian: I know. Just know that the tests came back and everything's normal. ",
        "Eve: Normal? This is not normal. The way I'm feeling is not normal. I'm so \r\nscared, Ian. ",
        "Ian: I know, I know, I know. ",
        "Eve: I'm so scared. ",
        "Ian: But maybe you being scared is what's causing this problem. ",
        "Eve: But he has so much power. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, so do we. And I don't care what Caleb wants or needs, he's \r\nnot getting our child. Do you understand me? ",
        "Eve: I wish I could believe you. ",
        "Ian: We've faced danger before. We've always come out on top. It's not going \r\nto be any different. ",
        "Eve: I wish I could be so sure. ",
        "Ian: I'll be sure for the both of us. ",
        "Eve: I could lose this baby. ",
        "Ian: No. It's not going to happen. All right? I promise you. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh. ",
        "Ian: What, do you have more pain? ",
        "Eve: No. He kicked. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? Well, that's your son telling you to take it easy, Mom. All right? \r\nSo you do that. You hold on to that. Believe in that. Come on. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Doc should have been back by now. He should have been here by now. ",
        "Livvie: Look, Caleb just wants to make me happy. If you let me go back to \r\nhim, he'll let my father go. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right! And your father would never forgive me if I let you go \r\nrunning back to that monster. You are staying here. ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, it won't do any good. Caleb will come for me. He loves me. ",
        "Lucy: He loves you? Livvie, that monster is not capable of love. Jack is the \r\none who really loves you. ",
        "Livvie: Jack is my past. Caleb is my future. ",
        "Jack: No, those aren't your words. Caleb has brainwashed you. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb is the man that I love. He's my future. ",
        "Lucy: He's -- don't you -- Livvie, don't you give a damn about that monster \r\nmaybe hurting your father? ",
        "Livvie: No. None of this is Caleb's fault. Why did you even come for me, \r\nLucy? I was doing just fine. ",
        "Lucy: Fine? She was doing fine. Fine -- you call running away with a vampire \r\ndoing fine? ",
        "Livvie: Well, it is what I want. Why can't you just forget about me, Lucy, \r\nand let me get married? Please. ",
        "Jack: Look, it's never going to happen, Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not going to happen. I'm not going to let you become some \r\nbride of Dracula. That is final. ",
        "Livvie: Fine. Then the two of you are responsible for whatever happens to my \r\nfather. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, you are not going to get married, and nothing is going to \r\nhappen to Kevin. I'm going to make sure of it. I'm going after him. ",
        "Jack: Wait, what do you mean you're going after him? Caleb -- you can't fight \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Lucy: I am going to do whatever it takes. I will figure it out when I get \r\nthere. You, Jack -- you've got to make sure she gets home. Do it! ",
        "Jack: Lucy, no! Don't go! It's suicide! ",
        "Livvie: No, I'm coming, too! ",
        "Jack: No, you're not going to go see that freak again. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, you're calling him a freak because he's a vampire? ",
        "Jack: Yes. ",
        "Livvie: So, Jack, then what does that make you? ",
        "Jack: Desperate. ",
        "Livvie: I hate you for doing this to me. ",
        "Jack: Then hate me. Because all that matters is saving your life. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: So, if you're willing to give Olivia and me your blessing, I'll be \r\nwilling to give your daughter a wonderful life. ",
        "Kevin: \"Life?\" You mean a living nightmare. ",
        "Caleb: Aren't you just a little ray of sunshine?",
        "Kevin: All you bring to my daughter's life is a world of pain and grief. ",
        "Caleb: Whatever happened to \"Congratulations, Caleb,\" \"Best wishes, Caleb?\" \r\nYour daughter knows who I am, and she still wants me. Maybe even more. Go \r\nfigure. ",
        "Kevin: She doesn't want you. All you've done is manipulate a naive, young \r\ngirl. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, she's not a girl. She's a woman in every sense of the word. Her \r\nsense of passion's amazing. ",
        "Kevin: Passion? She's in some kind of a trance. ",
        "Caleb: No. No, she wants me, body and soul. ",
        "Kevin: You shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you. ",
        "Caleb: Ah, what's that? What's that -- is that murder I see in your eyes? You \r\nsee, I know all about you, Doc. Didn't you have a brother that had a little \r\nnasty habit of doing too much killing? Maybe I'm the one that should be worried \r\nabout marrying into your family. ",
        "Kevin: You don't know anything about me. ",
        "Caleb: I know all about Ryan. That's child's play by my standard. What I'm \r\ntrying to say to you is you are in way over your head. ",
        "Kevin: Really? ",
        "Caleb: Hmm. ",
        "Kevin: As far as I'm concerned, one psychotic is the same as another. First, \r\nyou enjoy inflicting pain. ",
        "Caleb: Excuse me, are you going to be charging for this session, Doc? ",
        "Kevin: And then you delude yourself by justifying your actions. ",
        "Caleb: I can give Olivia all the pleasures in this world and the next. Now, \r\ntell me, what father wouldn't want that for his own daughter? ",
        "Kevin: This father! You think you're living the world's greatest love story?\r\n",
        "Caleb: I have a gift. What can I say? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I've seen what that gift can do. I saw what it did to the first \r\nOlivia. You kind of bring new meaning to ending a relationship, don't you? ",
        "Caleb: The last time was different. ",
        "Kevin: You killed that girl because she couldn't stand what you are. You'll \r\ndestroy Livvie the same way you destroyed her. ",
        "Caleb: Now it's you who doesn't know anything about me! ",
        "Kevin: I know Olivia despised you for what you are. You just snuffed her out. \r\nNot exactly giving a girl the world, is it? ",
        "Caleb: You can't stop me. ",
        "Kevin: I already have. Your wedding to my daughter is over. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I'm sorry I've been acting so -- ",
        "Ian: You need to get some rest, ok? ",
        "Eve: I can't. ",
        "Ian: You're going to force me to sing a lullaby. ",
        "Eve: Ok. I'll try. ",
        "Karen: How's our patient? ",
        "Eve: Karen, am I leaking amniotic fluid? Did you do a ferning test? ",
        "Karen: Yes. The results should be back any minute. ",
        "Ian: Ok. I'm going to lean on the lab. I love you. ",
        "Eve: I love you. ",
        "Ian: I'll be back. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Karen, you don't have to babysit me. ",
        "Karen: Hey, you know me -- any reason to get off the floor. ",
        "Eve: Ok. All right, well, hey, you know, we haven't had any girl talk in a \r\nwhile. What's new? I mean, should we talk about men? Or maybe makeup? Hey, you \r\nknow, your hair looks really cute today. I forgot to mention that. ",
        "Karen: Eve, I can't imagine what you're going through, and I'm not sure what \r\nto say except you're not alone. A lot of people are looking out for you, \r\nincluding me. ",
        "Eve: I wish that could be enough. Ian is going crazy trying to make this all \r\nok for me. But I don't even think he can. ",
        "Karen: Nobody is going to hurt you and your baby. ",
        "Eve: Karen, I know what I'm up against. And I hate just having to just sit \r\nhere like a big target and do nothing. There's got to be something I can do.",
        "",
        "Ian: I don't care what time it is, I need those test results now. ",
        "Frank: Guess you haven't heard you catch more flies with honey. ",
        "Ian: My wife is in there frightened out of her mind. ",
        "Frank: I know, I know. Karen is worried about Eve's emotional state, too. \r\nShe's worried it could cause harm with the pregnancy. ",
        "Ian: You don't think I know that? I'm tired of waiting around here, waiting \r\nfor Caleb to make his next move. Maybe I should just get it done. ",
        "Frank: You want to drive a stake through his heart? ",
        "Ian: Whatever it takes. ",
        "Frank: Look, if Karen were in there carrying my child, I would be freaked \r\nout, too. But if Caleb is what you say he is, can he be killed? ",
        "Ian: Anything that lives can be destroyed. ",
        "Frank: Unless it's already dead. ",
        "Ian: I've got to find a way to send him back to his grave. ",
        "Frank: Look, if there's anything I can do to help -- and I mean anything --\r\n",
        "Ian: Thanks. All I know is that this flying rodent is messing with the wrong \r\nfamily. ",

        "Livvie: I can't believe you're doing this. ",
        "Jack: Someday you'll understand. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, why won't you understand that I have to be with Caleb? ",
        "Jack: You just have to trust me again. ",
        "Livvie: How can I trust you when you kidnapped me? You took me away from the \r\nman that I love on my wedding day. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, you have to block out what Caleb's put in your head and remember \r\nhow much we meant to each other. ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Jack: What we had was strong, good, and I know you didn't forget that. Don't \r\nyou remember that we couldn't even get enough of each other? We couldn't even go \r\na day without seeing each other. ",
        "Livvie: But I'm marrying Caleb. ",
        "Jack: No. We're soul mates. You told me so. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, you have to stop saying that. ",
        "Jack: No, I can't stop. Because the woman I love is lost inside you and she's \r\nwaiting for me to find her. ",
        "Livvie: No. Jack, stop. Please? Just stop. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, it's just like when we first met. You were scared. It's like \r\nyou were sleeping. And then when we kissed for the first time, you came to life.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Jack, why are you doing this? ",
        "Jack: Because I love you. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: You keep talking like this, and I'm going to forget that you're my \r\nfuture father-in-law. ",
        "Kevin: How did it feel, Caleb? How did it feel to know that you murdered the \r\nwoman you loved? How does it feel to know that you destroyed her entire future?\r\n",
        "Caleb: All aboard. Guilt trip leaving the station. ",
        "Kevin: Olivia must have been terrified, but that didn't stop you, did it? In \r\nfact, I'll wager you even enjoyed it. ",
        "Caleb: I never meant to hurt her. Olivia was my life. I loved her. ",
        "Kevin: No, real love is about sacrifice, the kind of love that Jack feels for \r\nLivvie. He'd lay down his life for her, he wouldn't try to take it away. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's a nice testimonial for Jack, \r\nbut your daughter wants me. ",
        "Kevin: How long before the spell wears off, Caleb? How long before Livvie \r\nlooks at you in disgust? How long before she remembers what she feels for Jack \r\nand leaves you alone? ",
        "Caleb: That's not going to happen! Now, what's wrong with this picture? You \r\nknow what? Too much talking and not enough bleeding. ",
        "Kevin: I'm not afraid to die. I'm not afraid! Go ahead! As long as Livvie is \r\nok. ",
        "Caleb: You don't understand. Killing you -- that wouldn't be any fun. You \r\nsee, I'm going to turn you. I'm going to make you one of us. And then you'll \r\nbring your daughter to me. ",
        "Kevin: I'll never be one of you. I'll fight it. ",
        "Caleb: You can't fight it. Don't you get it? Look at Jack. He's trying. He's \r\na mess. The hunger always gets to you. ",
        "Lucy: Get the hell away from him! Oh, my God. Ok. What just happened here? \r\nDid I just scare a vampire? ",
        "Kevin: Don't ask questions, just go! Just run! Go! ",

        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Kevin: In fact, he looked scared. Lucy, the first time you saw Caleb, what \r\ndid he do? ",
        "Lucy: What? Well, he was at the lighthouse. He came to the door. I just -- I \r\ndidn't give him a chance to do anything. I slammed the door in his face. Why? \r\nWhat are you getting at? ",
        "Kevin: It's just so strange. He was in a rage, and I know he was going to \r\nkill me. ",
