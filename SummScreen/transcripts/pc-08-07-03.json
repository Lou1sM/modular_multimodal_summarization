        "With the show scheduled to begin in an hour, Caleb wonders where Olivia is, unaware that she's outside, paying a man to do something at exactly 10:30. Caleb prepares to exact his own revenge on the person who has his ring. As \"Georges,\" Chris seems to come into contact with almost everyone present. Fretting about one missing model, he tries unsuccessfully to recruit various people to fill in. Reese apologizes to Ricky for her behavior and reiterates her desire to meet his mother. Olivia bosses the other models around to keep everything on schedule. Jack apologizes to Reese, who can't forget his hurtful accusation about her willingness to sleep around. To Jamal's amusement, Imani destroys the film belonging to a photographer who took her picture. Ian figures out that \"Georges\" is really Chris in disguise. After the band plays their new song, Christina tries to get to Caleb, but Kevin holds onto her. Watching the clock, Olivia worries that Alison won't be in place in time. Christina makes a wish that her daddy could live with her and Lucy again. Kevin's friendly offer to introduce Alison at the end of the show goes horribly wrong when a light crashes down on his head at exactly 10:30, as he stands where Olivia expected Alison to be. Olivia's actions further backfire on her when the \"accident\" causes Christina to drop the ring."

        "Alison: Oh, can you believe this? That this -- this dream you had for us is actually happening?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah, well, I can't really believe that it's actually happening this way. You know, I didn't even imagine it this way.",
        "Alison: I didn't, either. I can't believe we're actually getting our own line of workout clothes designed by the Georges.",
        "Rafe: You know, when the press hits, we're going to have more business than we know what to do with.",
        "Alison: I know, I was actually thinking about that a little bit. But speaking of press, I mean, I'm surprised that nobody's here yet because, you know, the show does start in, like, an hour.",
        "Rafe: Don't worry. They'll be here. Probably as soon as Georges shows up, I'm sure.",
        "Alison: Right. Of course. He is the main attraction tonight.",
        "Rafe: No, not to me.",
        "Rafe: You know, but it probably doesn't hurt that we have the artist formerly known as Stephen Clay performing in concert.",
        "Alison: Rafe --",
        "Rafe: Ok, I'm not going to really look for trouble, but, you know, if he puts on his war paint, I'm ready.",
        "Alison: Look, hey, what if he is just here to play, you know, the numbers they have scheduled? What if that's it?",
        "Caleb: Enjoy the show, slayer. Payback is about to begin.",
        "Lucy: Oh, it looks great. Hi!",
        "Alison: Hi!",
        "Lucy: Hey.",
        "Woman: Hey, Christina.",
        "Christina: Hi.",
        "Woman: I'll keep an eye on her.",
        "Lucy: Thanks, Jennifer. Appreciate it. Ok, so we brought Christina. I hope you don't mind, because she really wanted to come.",
        "Alison: No, absolutely not.",
        "Rafe: It's ok.",
        "Alison: No, it's great.",
        "Ian: So are you ready?",
        "Alison: Yes, we are as ready as we'll ever be.",
        "Rafe: She's been a nervous wreck all day.",
        "Alison: No, that's not true. There's been a few minor problems, but it's good now.",
        "Ian: It looks like you're ready for the show anyway.",
        "Alison: Yeah. So --",
        "Lucy: What could go wrong with Georges as the designer? He's pretty good, you know.",
        "Alison: Absolutely.",
        "Caleb: Hey. You remember me? We met one time at Thanksgiving. Your name is --",
        "Christina: Christina.",
        "Caleb: Christina. That's right. I remember it was a pretty name. Huh.",
        "Christina: Want to see what I have?",
        "Caleb: Sure.",
        "Kevin: Hey, there's my most favorite little girl in the whole wide world. What are you doing all the way over here, huh? We're going to go over this way and we're going to say hello to your mom.",
        "Lucy: Hey.",
        "Kevin: I'll take her up upstairs with me.",
        "Lucy: Thanks, ok, please do. See you in a minute, pumpkin.",
        "Alison: Caleb's playing here tonight. Did you need something?",
        "Caleb: Now that you've asked, does anyone know where Olivia is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: It's all there, plus a little extra to show my appreciation.",
        "Man: Much obliged.",
        "Livvie: You know what to do. 10:30 on the dot.",
        "Man: 10:30. No problem.",
        "Livvie: All right. So, uh, that's it.",
        "Man: Nice doing business with you.",
        "Livvie: Ok, sorry, Miss Alison. Your show just might not be ending quite as you planned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb, I don't know where Livvie is. She's probably, you know, upstairs getting ready, doing her hair and makeup or something. But I really appreciate you playing tonight.",
        "Caleb: It's my pleasure.",
        "Alison: And you are just going to do the numbers scheduled, right?",
        "Caleb: Unless you have an extra skirt you want me to model.",
        "Alison: No, that would be wrong because then people would be staring at you and not my clothes.",
        "Caleb: Good luck tonight, Alison. I hope you have a good evening. I know I will.",
        "Alison: Caleb. Um, listen, it's a long story. Lucy, can I talk to you about some stuff before the show begins?",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah. I have a lot of things I want to talk to you about. I'd like to hear that long story about Caleb, too, if you don't mind.",
        "Rafe: Sorry about Caleb.",
        "Ian: No, no, I understand. It's a new business, you need the publicity. I understand.",
        "Rafe: That's not the only reason he's here.",
        "Ian: What is it?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. He might be up to something.",
        "Elizabeth: It looks so fantastic.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Lucy: It really does. We were just talking about you.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, were you? Well, it was a close call.",
        "Alison: Oh, I was just telling Lucy how grateful Rafe and I are to you. You promised us Georges and you more than delivered.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, well, it was touch-and-go there for a minute.",
        "Lucy: Touch-and-go? What do you mean? What happened?",
        "Alison: Oh, nothing, nothing that, you know, Georges couldn't fix, and he did, so everything's good.",
        "Lucy: Well, that Georges, he is really something.",
        "Elizabeth: George's definitely something else.",
        "Chris: [French accent] Excusez. Ah, you must beat that drum? Da-da-da -- stop it! You make me nervous.",
        "Imani: All right, I'm finished.",
        "Chris: Oh, you're finished? Now, that's wonderful. Let met see. You're not finished till I say you're finished. Let me see. Excusez. Now she finished. Beautiful. Ok, get her dressed.",
        "Reese: I am dressed.",
        "Chris: No, no, honey, this is not mine. Call me crazy, it's horrible.",
        "Reese: Wait, you think I'm one of your models, do you?",
        "Chris: You are not?",
        "Reese: I'm in the band.",
        "Chris: Oh, she's in the band. The band! Why I waste my time with the band?",
        "Reese: Well, I never said I was!",
        "Chris: Doesn't matter. I have bigger problem. Da-da-da-da. I don't have enough.",
        "Imani: Enough?",
        "Chris: [Normal voice] Models. I don't have enough freaking models. [French accent] It's a disaster, no? I do something here. I have work to do.",
        "Jamal: So, another hidden talent, huh? You're part of this, too?",
        "Imani: Just for fun.",
        "Jamal: Yeah? Well, I still think you should be modeling.",
        "Imani: Oh, no, I'm the caterer tonight, that's all.",
        "Jamal: I'd like to see you in one of those little skimpy, rinky-dinky outfits.",
        "Imani: Mm-hmm. I bet you would.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I would have. Coffee will be fine, though.",
        "Reese: So, Ricky, is that big family of yours coming to see the show?",
        "Ricky: Nah. I didn't tell them about it.",
        "Reese: Hey, I'm sorry I lost it earlier.",
        "Ricky: It's not a problem.",
        "Reese: Well, I wish your mum was coming. I'm dying to meet her, tell her what a lovely son she's raised.",
        "Jack: Oh, boy, this is going to be a long night.",
        "Alison: Oh, we're so glad that you're here. We have read all of your articles and everything. Hey.",
        "Rafe: So we still have a little time before things get started. Can we show you around?",
        "Man: Absolutely. We're very anxious to see this gym that has so inspired Georges.",
        "Alison: Good, good, good.",
        "Lucy: \"We're thrilled. We are so thrilled that you decided to grace --\" oh.",
        "Ian: Come here. Come here.",
        "Lucy: You caught me.",
        "Ian: You're going to be wonderful. Lucy I don't know, but thank you. And you're just wonderful.",
        "Ian: What do you mean by that?",
        "Lucy: Because you are putting up with me, trying to understand something that happened that I don't understand at all. And you're putting up with this whole Kevin whatever it is.",
        "Ian: Well, Christina loves him very much.",
        "Lucy: She loves you very, very much.",
        "Ian: Well, that makes me even more determined to get my life back.",
        "Lucy: Which reminds me -- we didn't finish that conversation. I really want to. Your research sounds promising and exciting and wonderful, too.",
        "Ian: We'll see.",
        "Lucy: It's going to work. And you know something -- if it does not work, that's ok by me because I will always feel the same way about you forever. I got to rehearse. You can't just sit here and babysit me. I can do this. I'm going to do it.",
        "Ian: I know you can. Just like being close to, that's all.",
        "Caleb: Olivia. Where have you been?",
        "Livvie: Hi. I've -- I was in the car. I had to get some stuff out of the car.",
        "Caleb: You were gone a long time.",
        "Livvie: You missed me. That's really sweet.",
        "Caleb: I always miss you.",
        "Livvie: Well, you're just -- you're going to have to miss me just a little bit longer because I have to go and get ready for the fashion show.",
        "Caleb: What's the rush?",
        "Livvie: Well, you know Alison and her schedule. We've got to be right on time, and I don't want her getting all hysterical on me, ok?",

        "Elizabeth: No. No.",
        "Chris: Yes.",
        "Elizabeth: I designed them. That's it. No.",
        "Chris: [Normal voice] Come on, you'd be saving both our butts here. What else am I supposed to do?",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Georges will think of something. He always does.",
        "Livvie: What's going on? Nobody's ready. Let's go.",
        "Jennifer: Excuse me. Who made you boss?",
        "Livvie: I'm just trying to help Alison stay on schedule. It'd be nice if you would all do the same.",
        "Woman: Well, you don't have to be such a --",
        "Chris: [French accent] Ok, ok! Ladies, let's have a little saucer of milk for the kitty cats. We have enough problems here, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: I'd say. They're going to start the show in five minutes and we're not going to be there.",
        "Chris: Yes, thank you, you are such a bright, chilly ray of -- that is it! Look at that! Attention! Look. That's it.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Chris: Yes, this -- this little, this scowl of yours.",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on!",
        "Chris: No teeth, no smile. That's on the runway.",
        "Livvie: You French freak, we don't have time for this, ok? We've got to go.",
        "Chris: Ok, number one, I am not French. Number two, we must go, we must do it, we must have fun. These girls are not professionals. I need your help.",
        "Livvie: All right, well, then why don't you start with doing something useful, like tell them to get their asses out there and be sure to hit their marks.",
        "Chris: What she said! Yes! Hit the marks!",
        "Livvie: Jack, let's go.",
        "Chris: Come on, please, everyone.",
        "Caz: All right.",

        "Reese: Thanks.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry if I offended you.",

        "Elizabeth: Thank you. I was ready to throw myself out the window when that check bounced and when the clothes didn't come, but once again you saved the day. I owe you big time, ok?",

Welcome to our wonderful show. We are thrilled to introduce a new line of workout and fitness wear, and it's in honor of my cousin Rafe and Alison's new, fantastic gym we're all in, and we want to introduce these exciting clothes to you.

        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Lucy: He is one of the hottest designers coming out of Paris, working in our country now, and we're lucky to have him in Port Charles. So without further ado, we're going to kick it off with some music, and let me introduce to you The Experience.",

        "[Applause]",
        "Lucy: Thanks, Jamal! Everybody give a big hand for Jamal.",
        "Livvie: Oh, god, it can't be happening. We're totally behind.",
        "Lucy: Thank you so much. Um, ok. We're not done. We have so many more hot, hot, hot clothes for you to see, and another model should be out on the runway, but they're not. So I'm going to check and see just quickly like and see what's going on, but just be patient and I will be right back. No -- no worries. My dear god.",
