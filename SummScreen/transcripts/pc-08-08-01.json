        "Lucy: Doc, what -- what are we doing? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, let's see -- no car, thumbs out. I guess this is \r\nhitchhiking. ",
        "Lucy: I know what it is, but look at us. It's in the middle of the night, \r\nwe're in the middle of nowhere, and, what, a car hasn't gone by for at least 30 \r\nminutes now. ",
        "Kevin: Someone will come along. Someone has to. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Stay calm. Jack was determined to get Livvie home safely, so don't \r\nworry. What? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, and Caleb was just as determined to stop him. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, and to stop us. But he didn't. ",
        "Kevin: So? ",
        "Lucy: So -- something has to be up with that. I mean, there he was coming at \r\nyou with his fangs bared. He could have killed you. He could have bitten you \r\nright there, but I run in and barely touch him. I just shoved him a little, and \r\nhe stopped dead in his tracks. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you're not suggesting that you could still somehow be related to \r\nthat, are you? ",
        "Lucy: Well, what else could it be? He didn't bite me. Maybe I am related \r\nsomehow to that. ",
        "Kevin: Somebody's coming. Thumbs, thumbs, thumbs, thumbs! Leg, leg! Anything.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Woo-woo! If they don't stop, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. ",
        "Kevin: Just make sure that he does. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, wait a minute. Wait, what are you -- that's a Mack truck, Doc! \r\nIt's an 18-wheeler! You'll be killed! ",
        "[Truck horn blows] ",
        "Kevin: It's not going to get by me. ",
        "[Tires screech] ",
        "Lucy: Doc! ",
        "",
        "Alison: I'm so excited to see Livvie. I'm so glad that she's back. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Too bad that she doesn't want to be back, though. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, I'm sure that Jack has had time to bring her around. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Spunky, don't go getting your hopes up. When Jack called from \r\nthe plane, he said -- ",
        "Alison: I know, I know, I know. She was furious. I know, ok? But she's home \r\nnow, and I'm sure that Jack has had time to make her see that Caleb has just \r\nbeen using her. ",
        "Jamal: They haven't even been home for an hour yet. ",
        "Alison: Right. Jamal, why don't you just knock on the door, ok, because needs \r\nhis blood. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Hi. ",
        "Jack: Hey, you got it? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, I got it right here. ",
        "Alison: So, how is Livvie? ",
        "Jamal: You making headway yet? ",
        "Jack: Well, I tried, but all she wants is Caleb. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Your brother is after my baby. You're the only one who can stop him. ",
        "Michael: Eve, even if I thought I could -- ",
        "Eve: You can. And you will. I know you will because I know the truth. ",
        "Michael: The truth? ",
        "Eve: The other day, you were praying. I heard you tell God that you'd fallen \r\nin love with me. ",
        "",
        "Michael: Oh, Eve, you misunderstood. My love for you is strictly as a friend.\r\n",
        "Eve: It's ok. I know you'd never act on those feelings. But I also know it's \r\nbecause of those feelings that you won't turn me away. ",
        "Michael: I'm not sure what you want from me. ",
        "Eve: I want your help. Caleb wants to take away the most precious thing in my \r\nlife. ",
        "Michael: Eve, you know I would do anything -- ",
        "Eve: Don't tell me you can't do this! You know what your brother is! You \r\nlocked him up because of it! You gave me this amulet for protection because of \r\nit. You're the only one that knows how to deal with him. ",
        "Michael: I did. He's much worse now. I don't know what I can do with him. ",
        "Eve: If you have any love for me at all, you'll get rid of your brother. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Oh, man. I don't know what I would do without you guys. You guys always \r\ncome through. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, come on, you're our friend. You and Livvie both. ",
        "Alison: So, where is she? ",
        "Jack: She's upstairs locked in her room. ",
        "Alison: Well, I'm going to go try and talk to her. ",
        "Jack: Hope you have better luck then I did. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: So, what's the deal, man? How is she? How bad is it? ",
        "Jack: Caleb has her brainwashed. It's like she doesn't even remember -- ",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on, come on, you know Livvie. Deep down she loves you in \r\nthere, right? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. That's what I keep trying to tell myself. There's got to be some \r\nway to reach out to her, you know? ",
        "Jamal: You will, ok? He doesn't stand a chance. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, you're right. I'm going to get her back. What about Gabby? How's \r\nshe doing? ",
        "Jamal: She's the same as Livvie -- under the spell. ",
        "Jack: Does my brother still have her locked in that cage? ",
        "Jamal: It's pretty messed up. ",
        "Jack: Well, maybe if you try to -- ",
        "Jamal: You know what? I tried that brother-sister family thing, and she \r\ndoesn't want any part of it. ",
        "Jack: Jamal, you got to try again. ",
        "Jamal: Look, she doesn't want my help. ",
        "Jack: She's like Livvie. She doesn't know what she wants. And she's got to \r\nknow that you're not going to turn your back on her. ",
        "Jamal: All right, all right, I'll give it another shot. ",
        "Jack: Go do it. Tell her I'm pulling for her, too. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Thanks. ",
        "Alison: Do what now, Jamal? ",
        "Jamal: I'm going to go check on Gabby. ",
        "Alison: Gabby? No, Jamal. I don't think that that is a good idea. ",
        "Jamal: Sweetie, sweetie, it's ok. Don't worry about anything. I'll be back \r\nsoon, ok? Welcome home, Livvie. ",
        "Jack: Hey, everything's going to be all right, ok? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, everything's going to be just fine now that Livvie's \r\nhome. So, how are you? I mean, we were really worried about you. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you shouldn't have been. ",
        "Alison: Uh, well, Caleb -- he didn't like -- ",
        "Livvie: Didn't what? ",
        "Alison: Hurt you in any way? ",
        "Livvie: No, of course he didn't hurt me, Alison. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, Alison is just concerned about you. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb is not this monster you all seem to think he is. He is kind and \r\nhe's wonderful, and he is my future. ",
        "Alison: It's what he's programmed into your brain. In reality -- ",
        "Livvie: No, Alison! You are so wrong! ",
        "Alison: He's using you! ",
        "Livvie: You wouldn't say that if you knew what he did for me. ",
        "Jack: What has he done for you except destroy your life, huh? ",
        "Livvie: He brought me my mother. ",
        "",
        "Waitress: Two coffees, one tea. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you so much. And thank you for stopping to pick us up, and thank \r\nyou also for not squishing my 10-4 good buddy. ",
        "Man: What was that guy thinking anyway, throwing himself in front of a 20-ton \r\nsemi? ",
        "Lucy: Well, he wasn't thinking. It wasn't smart. You know, he's just had a \r\nlot on his mind. He's been on edge lately. ",
        "Kevin: All right, I spoke to Victor. He heard from Jack. Livvie's home safe.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, thank God. ",
        "Kevin: He's sending a plane for you and I, but we're stuck here for at least \r\nanother hour. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. We'll just take a deep breath. You can relax, and Livvie's fine. \r\nShe's with Jack. ",
        "Kevin: She's with Jack. Being with Jack isn't exactly a comforting thought.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Jack loves her very much. ",
        "Kevin: Fine, he loves her. He's also a vampire. ",
        "Lucy: Umpire. Umpire. He's an umpire. ",
        "Man: What's he got against umps? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, golly, let me think that -- oh, bad call. You know, he's a little \r\nguy, and that umpire did a bad call, and he's never trusted them since. You \r\nknow, it stuck in his craw or something. Excuse me. Just pardon me. ",
        "Man: Sure. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, what are you doing? Ix-nay on the ampire-vay. This is like Podunk, \r\nU.S.A. This is not Transylvania. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I have bigger things to worry about. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I know. And we're going to be home soon. Livvie's going to be \r\nfine. She's going to be all right. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, for the moment. But we both know that Caleb won't stop trying to \r\nget to her. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, he'll have to just come through me to get to her. Ok. But \r\nyou have to admit he couldn't touch me. He didn't bite me, so that means maybe \r\n-- just maybe the reason is because we're somehow related -- hopefully distant \r\nrelations -- and the point is, is I might be the key to stopping him for good. \r\nWhat are you doing? ",
        "Kevin: I'll be right back. ",
        "Lucy: Where are you going? Where -- what are you doing? ",
        "Kevin: Excuse me. Special Agent Collins, federal government. ",
        "Man: I didn't mean to do it. It's just my cousin -- he got the -- he got the \r\ndisk from his work, and these spreadsheet programs are really -- ",
        "Kevin: It's all right, son. I have bigger fish to fry. All I need from you \r\nright now is some help. ",
        "Man: Sure. Anything. ",
        "Kevin: I need to commandeer this computer just for a little while. ",
        "Man: Commandeer -- ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's a matter of security. ",
        "Man: Sure. Take all the time you need. ",
        "Kevin: I will. ",
        "Lucy: Wow. Where did you learn to do that? ",
        "Kevin: Learned from the master. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Ok, what are we doing? We're -- what, you're going online? You're \r\ngoing -- ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: What for? ",
        "Kevin: To surf the old family tree. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. To find out if my family has some branches connected to \r\nCaleb, right? ",
        "Kevin: And if I find one of those branches, I'm going to chop it off. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Are you saying that Caleb took Rachel from the hospital? ",
        "Livvie: No. My mother came on her own free will. ",
        "Alison: But how is that possible? I mean, she's -- ",
        "Livvie: Fine, Alison. Completely recovered. And I don't care if either of you \r\nbelieve me. I know what I saw. She was healthy and beautiful, and she even gave \r\nme her blessing to marry Caleb. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, what you saw -- what you think you saw is from Caleb. He put it \r\nin your head. ",
        "Livvie: No, he wouldn't do that to me. ",
        "Jack: No? Then let's go. I'll take you to see your mom, and you'll see. ",
        "Livvie: No, you'll see. And when you do, you're going to take me back to him \r\nwhere I belong. ",
        "Alison: Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: You, too, Alison. I want you to see for yourself. I'll get my things.\r\n",
        "Alison: Jack? What has he done to her? ",
        "Jack: I don't know, but I've got to do something. ",
        "Alison: Well, you're not really going to take her to go see Rachel? ",
        "Jack: I've tried every other way to break through. ",
        "Alison: I don't think it's a good idea if I go with you. I think you guys \r\nshould go alone. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I think you're right. ",
        "Alison: I'm going to go home and wait for Jamal. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, he's doing some breaking through of his own. But don't worry, all \r\nright? ",
        "Alison: I know. I just -- I can't help it. I'm really worried about him being \r\nwith Gabby. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Gabriela: Visiting hours are over. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, it's killing me to see you in here like this. ",
        "Gabriela: Then let me out. ",
        "Jamal: It won't be forever, ok? I promise. I will find a way to help you. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't want your help. ",
        "Jamal: All right, but before I go, I'm going to leave you with something. ",
        "Gabriela: What? A little welcome-to-the-family present? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, look, Gabby, the point I'm trying to make here is that I really \r\nconsider myself a brother just as much as Emilio and the rest of those guys. Ok, \r\nnow, I know that I'll never be as close to you as them, you know, being that, \r\nyou know, you guys were raised together and everything, but I figure just maybe \r\nwe could catch up on the missed years and everything, you know? My mom, when I \r\nwas growing up, was always snapping photos, and -- you can see I was -- I was \r\nactually kind of cute, you know? ",
        "Gabriela: Get it straight, brother. I don't care. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: So, you really think these genealogy web sites work? ",
        "Kevin: I know Victor traced the Collins clan all the way back to the 17th \r\ncentury. ",
        "Lucy: Wow. Ok, ok, wait, we have Caleb and Michael -- last name Morley, \r\nm-o-r-l-e-y. ",
        "Kevin: That's a good idea. ",
        "Lucy: I can't believe we're doing this. Doc, I've always wondered where I \r\ncame from -- you know, my history. And now we can finally figure it out, and I'm \r\ngoing to find out that I'm descended from vampires? ",
        "Kevin: We don't know that for sure just yet. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but it would explain why Caleb didn't bite me. It could also \r\nexplain maybe how my parents died. You know, it's got to be my father's side \r\nbecause Aunt Charlene is normal. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it could explain also your -- ",
        "Lucy: Special intuitiveness. ",
        "Kevin: Exactly. ",
        "Lucy: Right. So if it's true my family is descended from vampires, then I \r\nhave -- um, umpires, you know? My aunt, uncles, sisters, brothers. Everybody -- \r\nthey're umpires. A very unusual family, you know? ",
        "Waitress: Unusual. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: What was that you were saying about ix-nay? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, stop, Doc. This is kind of important. Do you realize that if I am \r\nsomehow related to Caleb, that means I'm the only person that could save Livvie.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Wait. Hold it. ",
        "Lucy: What? What? ",
        "Kevin: I just found it -- a link for Coe. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, go. Go with it. Go, go, go. ",
        "Kevin: I'm trying to, but I keep getting error messages. Damn it! ",
        "Lucy: What? What happened? ",
        "Kevin: I just got cut off. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: And I can't get back on. I don't have time for this! ",
        "Lucy: Calm down, calm down. Deep breath. ",
        "Kevin: I can't calm down. I'm not going to take a deep breath. I need to have \r\nanswers, and I need them right now! Big security issue. Huge. ",
        "Lucy: Umpires. You shouldn't have brought that up -- the umpire thing. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, God, Lucy. I am losing it here. It's just that if I even think for \r\na second that you could be related to a -- ",
        "Lucy: Umpire! ",
        "Kevin: Umpire. ",
        "Lucy: Umpire. ",
        "Kevin: I guess I'm just so desperate for answers, I'm trying to grab anything \r\nI can. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, me, too. Me, too. ",
        "Kevin: I'm going to call Victor, see if I can get an ETA on that plane.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. All right. ",
        "",
        "Michael: It's beyond my control. ",
        "Eve: That's not true. You've always had control over Caleb. ",
        "Michael: That was before. Before he saw Livvie. ",
        "Eve: Please -- will you please stop telling me that you can't do this? My \r\nGod, Caleb is preying on an innocent young girl. And he wants my baby! ",
        "Michael: He can't touch you as long as you're wearing the necklace. ",
        "Eve: No. You don't understand. Michael, he has gotten inside my head. I hear \r\nhis voice, his threats. And I don't know if it's real or if it's just fear \r\ntrying to drive me crazy. I don't know, but there's nothing I can do to stop it, \r\nbut you can. You can stop him. Please. Please. I'm begging you. ",

        "Gabriela: What am I supposed to do with a bunch of stupid pictures? ",
        "Jamal: I don't know. I got a bunch more, so -- tear them up, burn them up, \r\nthrow them away. Do what you want, but I'll still be back. ",
        "Gabriela: Why? ",
        "Jamal: Because like my mom always said, family is family. You stand by each \r\nother no matter what. So that's what I'm going to do, whether you like it or \r\nnot. ",

        "Nurse: Rachel hasn't had any visitors in quite some time. ",
        "Jack: No one? ",
        "Nurse: Well, her mother, Estelle. But she became so upset that there was no \r\nchange -- ",
        "Livvie: What do you mean no change? Of course there's been a change. She's \r\nfeeling much better now. ",
        "Livvie: Mom? Mom, it's Livvie. I'm here. I told them that you were feeling \r\nmuch better now, and they don't believe me. Mom? Mom, you've got to tell them. \r\nHey, you've got to tell them that you came to see me and we had such a great \r\ntime together. Mom, it was just like the old days. Why are you doing this? Mom, \r\ntell them, please! Come on. ",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. ",

        "Lucy: Ok, that's good. Now, listen -- you need to listen to me. I just \r\nmanaged to reconnect, and I found some of the Coes that go way, way back. ",
        "Kevin: I thought we gave up on that. ",
        "Lucy: No, you gave up on that. ",
        "Kevin: Very funny. Don't tell me the Coes were wandering bands of \r\nfortunetelling gypsies? ",
        "Lucy: No, it seems they come from an area in eastern Europe. ",
        "Kevin: Eastern Europe? Isn't that where -- ",
        "Lucy: Yes, where umpires originated. ",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my goodness, I've found my great-great -- three greats \r\n-- great-great-great grandmother. She migrated from a little village called \r\nMulderstan. ",
