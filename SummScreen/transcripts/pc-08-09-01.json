        "Michael: Eve, you were right. I am in love with you. ",
        "Ian: Lovely evening, Father. ",
        "Eve: Ian, the -- ",
        "Michael: I'm sorry. I am way out of line. I don't know what came over me. ",
        "Ian: You don't? Well, I do. ",
        "Eve: Ok, please, don't. ",
        "Ian: And I can't say that I blame you. ",
        "Michael: I'm not sure I understand. ",
        "Ian: Knowing Eve the way that I do, I can't blame any man for falling in love \r\nwith her. ",

        "Jamal: Hey, what up, Spunky? How's Livvie? ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, Jamal, it's going to be a long road back to normal for \r\nher. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I know. She'll get there, though. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, let's just hope so, you know? ",
        "Jamal: And? ",
        "Alison: And what? ",
        "Jamal: Come on, it's your turn to ask. ",
        "Alison: Hmm? ",
        "Jamal: Ask me how my sister's doing. Ask me how Gabby is. ",
        "Alison: Well, has there been any change? ",
        "Jamal: Nope. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's kind of what I figured. That's why I didn't ask. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I just wish I could get through to her. I just don't know what \r\nit's going to take. ",
        "Alison: I just wish that I could get through to you and make you try and ease \r\nup on this whole sister thing. ",
        "Jamal: Sister thing? ",
        "Alison: Well, I mean, call it whatever you want, Jamal. Ok, but the more \r\ninvolved you get, the more you're just setting yourself up. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on, she's my sister. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, Caleb is her family. She does everything that he tells her to, \r\njust like Livvie, only worse because Gabby is a vampire. And if you keep trying \r\nto get close, you are only going to get hurt. And I am not talking about your \r\nfeelings. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hello? Anybody home? ",
        "Lucy: Jack? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie? Oh, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Hey. ",
        "Jack: Glad you guys are here. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, thank God. ",
        "Lucy: Hey, I'm -- I'm really glad you're ok. ",
        "Jack: Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: You all right? ",
        "Jack: So, how did you get away from Caleb? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, ooh -- confusing, long story. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, never mind that. Besides, where the heck were you? I thought we \r\nwere all supposed to meet back here. ",
        "Jack: Well, Livvie had some of her own ideas, so I took her to see Rachel.\r\n",
        "Kevin: You what? ",
        "Jack: Well, Caleb has her believing that her mom was cured, so I wanted her \r\nto see with her own two eyes that her mom is still in the hospital. ",
        "Lucy: Good. That -- that was very good. Now Livvie knows that Caleb was lying \r\nto her. ",
        "Jack: Yes. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, Livvie. That couldn't have been easy. ",
        "Livvie: Easy? No, nothing's easy anymore. ",
        "Kevin: Well, at least now you know the truth. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, the truth? Yeah, you bet I do. The truth is he made my mother \r\nsick again. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, he's responsible for what happened to her, and I will never \r\nforgive him for that. Ever. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: So, what, you think Gabby is going to try to hurt me? ",
        "Alison: Well, Jamal, I mean, Emilio has been her brother her whole life, and \r\nlook what she did to him. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on, that's not going to happen. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, do you have that in writing from her? In blood? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok, ok. You're not her biggest fan. Ok, I can live with that. ",
        "Alison: Great. I'm just trying to make you stay alive so that you can \r\nlive with that. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on, she's my sister. And whatever she's become, if I've \r\nknown her for five minutes or five lifetimes, I'm not going to sit up here and \r\nturn my back on her. ",
        "Alison: I don't want you to turn your back on her. That's the last thing that \r\nI want you to do, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Look, she's family, ok? And whether you like it or not, I'm going to \r\nkeep trying to get through to her. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, do you really think that you can turn a vampire into the \r\nsister that you never had? That's crazy. You cannot melt Gabby's heart by caring \r\nabout her. ",
        "Jamal: It's the same thing Jack's trying to do with Livvie. ",
        "Alison: No, it's not. It's different because Livvie, she's not a vampire. And \r\nJack and Livvie, they are in love. ",
        "Jamal: So what? Livvie's under Caleb's spell, same as Gabby. ",
        "Alison: No, there's a very big difference. You cannot trust Gabby. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby is a victim. Ali, she's a human being and she's locked in that \r\ncage, for God's sakes. ",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal, I'm sorry, but, good. Because who knows who would be her \r\nnext victim? ",
        "Jamal: What chance will Gabby ever have of getting her real life back if \r\nsomeone doesn't care enough to try to help her? You can't keep blaming Gabby for \r\nwhat Caleb did to her. ",
        "Alison: Ok, all right. Ok. She is your sister. The woman is your sister. You \r\nwant to get to know her better. Ok, I understand that, Jamal. I get that. That's \r\nfine. ",
        "Jamal: No, no -- no, you see, Ali, you don't get it, ok? You don't get it. \r\nSee, I'm trying to save Gabby's life. Ok, that's the same thing you and I were \r\ntrying to do with Jack's life. ",
        "Alison: No, no. The difference between Gabby and Jack is like night and day.\r\n",
        "Jamal: What difference? Ali, there is no difference. ",
        "Alison: There is a difference because Jack wanted us to help him. Gabby \r\ndoesn't. I'm sorry, Jamal, but Jack wanted us to help him. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Livvie, listen to me. Jack has nothing to do with your mother's \r\ncondition. ",
        "Livvie: But I saw her at the villa, Dad. She was fine. ",
        "Kevin: No. She hasn't shown any improvement from the day she was admitted.\r\n",
        "Livvie: How do you know? ",
        "Kevin: Because I keep up on her. I have a report faxed to my office every \r\nweek. ",
        "Livvie: No. But I talked to her. I held her, Dad. We cried together. She was \r\neven going to give me away. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, it was all an illusion. Everything Caleb said he would give to \r\nyou is just a dream. ",
        "Livvie: No. Stop. ",
        "Jack: Caleb's even got you believing that becoming a vampire is some kind of \r\nspecial gift. ",
        "Livvie: You don't know anything about the kind of life that Caleb offered me.\r\n",
        "Jack: The kind of life? Livvie, I know all about that life. We drink blood. \r\nThat's what vampires do. ",
        "Livvie: No, stop! ",
        "Jack: That's what he's offering you. That's the prize he wants to share with \r\nyou. It's torture. ",
        "Livvie: No, you're wrong. Jack, he'd never lie to me about this. Never. ",
        "Lucy: Caleb has lied to you, Livvie. That's all he's been doing is lying to \r\nyou. Jack is right. ",
        "Livvie: No. But he can't be. ",
        "Kevin: Caleb knows how to work his way into your mind, Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: And he wants to own you. He wants to possess you, and he will do \r\nanything, even use dark magic to get to you. ",
        "Jack: That's why I stopped the wedding -- because I didn't want him to turn \r\nyou into what he is. ",
        "Kevin: Jack saved your life, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God. ",
        "Kevin: You know that's true. Don't turn away. Look at him. He's telling the \r\ntruth. ",
        "Lucy: We all are telling the truth. ",
        "Kevin: Jack has never stopped loving you. Take one look at him and you'll \r\nknow that's true, every word. Look at him. ",
        "",
        "Michael: I don't know what to say. ",
        "Ian: Well, then don't say a thing. ",
        "Eve: Ian, please don't do this. ",
        "Ian: What? Finally, something that we agree upon, right? You have feelings \r\nfor her, I have feelings for her because we both know what a wonderful person \r\nshe is. And no, I don't blame you for falling in love with my wife. But it \r\nbothers me that you may think, even for one moment, that you could love her more \r\nthan I already do. ",
        "Michael: I understand. ",
        "Ian: Good. Because she needs your help right now. Your brother is threatening \r\nher and her baby. ",
        "Michael: I understand that, too. ",
        "Ian: So why are you letting it happen, Michael? ",
        "Michael: I'm -- I'm not letting Caleb do anything. ",
        "Ian: You're not stopping it, Father. And all evil needs to triumph is for a \r\nfew good men to do nothing. ",
        "Michael: I wouldn't say I've done nothing. ",
        "Ian: No? Your brother is out there wreaking havoc while you're in here \r\npraying for guidance and strength. ",
        "Michael: I've done more than pray. You know that. For years I have been my \r\nbrother's keeper, his jailer. ",
        "Ian: His jailer? His jailer, Michael? Then why is it that you're stuck behind \r\nthe stone wall? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ali, you awake? ",
        "Alison: Maybe. ",
        "Jamal: So what do you say, Spunky? Conversations now or nightmares later? ",
        "Alison: Jamal, all I was trying -- ",
        "Jamal: Ali -- look, I hate it when we argue. Seriously. ",
        "Alison: I know. I know. I do, too. I don't want to ever go to bed upset. So \r\nwhat do you say? Should we just, like, forget about it? ",
        "Jamal: Well, come on, pretending it isn't there never helps in the end. ",
        "Alison: Ok, Jamal, look -- we don't -- we don't actually know if Jack will \r\never be Jack again, so how can we be so sure that Gabby will ever be Gabby \r\nagain? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I'm not. The one thing I'm sure is that she's family. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, there's more to being family than just being related. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, family is family. I mean, what do you want me to do? Come on, \r\ntell me, tell me, what's going to make you happy? Tell me, because I don't know.\r\n",
        "Alison: Jamal, ok! Why don't you just do what I do, ok? If someone in your \r\nfamily doesn't want you around, then you just stay away. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. Ok, I've lost too many relatives \r\nalready, and I like keeping the ones that I have close. ",
        "Alison: But, Jamal, all it is is -- ",
        "Jamal: No, Ali, you know what? If you want to write off your parents, ok, \r\nthat's your problem, not mine. ",
        "Alison: Let's just add that one to the list there, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, you know I didn't mean it like that. I didn't. ",
        "Alison: Don't. Leave me alone, seriously. ",
        "Jamal: No, you know I can't do that, either. You know me. Come here. ",
        "Alison: Don't. ",
        "Jamal: Come here, come here, come here. I'm sorry. Forgive me, ok? Honest, I \r\ndidn't mean it. ",

        "Livvie: I do love you, Jack. ",
        "Jack: I love -- ",
        "Livvie: But it's different with Caleb. And none of you understand that. I \r\nfeel -- God, I feel -- ",
        "Jack: What? You feel what? ",
        "Livvie: That I belong to him. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, that's what he wants you to feel. ",
        "Livvie: No, Dad, it's me. I know what I want and what I feel. ",
        "Jack: It isn't Caleb. Believe me, he's not who you want. ",
        "Livvie: Why, Jack? Because you think it's you? Don't you dare tell me who I \r\nwant or don't. This is my life. ",
        "Lucy: What if it's not? Livvie, what if it's not your life? What if someone's \r\ntrying to twist your heart and your mind, try to control you and make you think \r\nyou want what they want you to want? ",
        "Livvie: No, but that's not it. ",
        "Lucy: That is it. He wants you to believe what he wants you to know. \r\nThat's all. Just keep away. ",
        "Livvie: No, stop! Stop! It's the same every time. I think you finally all \r\nunderstand me and then you start right back in again. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, please, you have to believe us. ",
        "Livvie: No! I can't! And I am leaving here the first chance I get, I swear. I \r\nam going back to Caleb where I belong because he is the only one who understands \r\nme. ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- Livvie, hold on a second. ",
        "Kevin: Don't let her go. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, come on. Don't do this. ",
        "",
        "Michael: You're saying that I've locked myself away. ",
        "Ian: You tell me, Father. Can a man put too much faith in prayer? ",
        "Michael: I don't know anymore. Maybe I haven't done enough to stop Caleb. ",
        "Ian: You haven't, Michael. But if there ever was a time to set it right, it's \r\nnow. ",
        "Michael: Many have tried. ",
        "Ian: They weren't you. You told us yourself. If anyone can stop him, it's \r\nyou. ",
        "Michael: I'm not sure that's true anymore. ",
        "Eve: Find out. Listen to your heart, your soul. Be honest with yourself, and \r\nyou'll know what is the right thing to do. Please, Michael. ",
        "Michael: Do you have any idea what you're asking me to do? The only way to \r\nend this. You're asking me to kill my brother. You're asking me to kill my \r\nbrother. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I never meant to hurt you. ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Jamal: I'm just -- I'm just so whacked, you know, I didn't know what I was \r\nsaying. ",
        "Alison: No. You did, and you meant it, and you were right. Jamal, just \r\nbecause I feel the way I do about my family doesn't mean you have to feel the \r\nsame way about Gabby. You know? ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: See, I've never really been a part of a family before. I mean, not \r\nlike a close one. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you're part of one now. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. But you're the only one who's, like, really treated me like \r\nfamily, you know? So I guess part of me is a little afraid of maybe losing you \r\nor even sharing you. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Gabby may be my sister, but you're my home. Hey -- my life. And \r\nthat's never going to change. You got that? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, you're going to always come first with me, baby. First and always.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Always. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Oh, man. I'm starting to think we may never break through to her. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, well, that might be a possibility. So we have to stop Caleb. ",
        "Jack: Tell me what I don't know. ",
        "Kevin: Actually, we may have a way to do that. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Lucy: Um, well, when you and Livvie, after you left on the plane, of course, \r\nobviously I went back to the villa to get Doc. ",
        "Jack: You found a way to hold off Caleb and get away. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it's not something we found. It just sort of happened. ",
        "Lucy: Caleb was going to attack Doc. He came at him, so I jumped in between \r\nthem and I sort of shoved Caleb. ",
        "Kevin: As soon as she laid her hands on him, he stopped dead in his track.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, he couldn't touch me. He could not do anything. He sort of \r\nrecoiled, and so I figured the only way that might have happened is if we're \r\nrelated. ",
        "Jack: Related? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I know it's strange, but he couldn't bite me. He couldn't touch \r\nme. ",
        "Kevin: So we did some checking. ",
        "Lucy: And it gets even more bizarre. I -- I found out my family has roots in \r\nTransylvania. ",
        "Jack: You got to be kidding me. ",
        "Kevin: No, she's not. ",
        "Lucy: I know it was -- so we just -- we thought there might be a connection. \r\nSomehow I can find something out if we go to Transylvania, so we decided to do \r\nit tonight. ",
        "Kevin: Actually, I'm not sure it's a good idea to go tonight. Maybe we should \r\nwait. ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. We decided this. We should go. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. You shouldn't leave her alone. Fine. Then I'll go. I'll go \r\nalone. ",
        "Jack: To Transylvania? Look, I don't think that's a very good idea, Lucy. ",
        "Kevin: He's right about that. ",
        "Lucy: But we -- we can't save Livvie. We can't ever make sure she's safe if \r\nwe don't get rid of Caleb, and this is a way to find out how everything's \r\nconnected. I'm going to go. ",
        "Kevin: All right, you're right about that, too. All right, the only way any \r\nof us are going to get any peace is if we end this once and for all. If that \r\nmeans that you're the key to this, fine. We go to the source and we get some \r\nanswers now. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I'll take care of Livvie while you're gone. ",
        "Kevin: Why don't you just make sure that Jamal is here to help you out?",
        "Jack: I know you have a problem with the way I am. So do I, Dr. Collins. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I don't have any choice right now, do I? I hate the idea of \r\nleaving Livvie, but -- if we don't get to the source and get those answers, we \r\ncould lose her forever. ",
