        "Rafe is angry with Jamal for having withheld information about Caleb's ring, but Jamal wants to move past this and do something about it now. Before they can leave for the gym, Caleb appears, taunting them with the fact that he is wearing his ring. Although Jamal wants to take it away from him, Rafe reminds him that the ring protects Caleb from all other vampires. Rafe grabs a scalpel to use against his enemy, but Alison shows up and inadvertently stops Rafe from making his move before Caleb vanishes. Alison is disgusted to hear that Rafe intended to cut the ring off Caleb's finger. She's also glad to hear that Caleb has his ring back. Her words stun Rafe, who can't believe that she trusts Caleb not to use the ring against them. He vows to do whatever it takes to get the ring back. When Chris and Ian fill Kevin in on his condition, Kevin realizes that he may be facing permanent paralysis. He asks Ian to remove himself from his case, and although Lucy objects, Ian agrees that it would be for the best. When Kevin asks for Christina, Ian goes to get her. Lucy assures Kevin that he will be all right. Christina requests that Kevin go home with her and Lucy. Although Imani turns down Jamal's offer to stay at his place for safety, she asks him to walk her to work, and they leave the hospital hand in hand. After leaving Rafe, Caleb goes to Olivia, who is crying her eyes out in the stairwell. He holds her responsible for what happened to her father, because he knows that she was trying to hurt Alison. He is furious with her for sabotaging his plans, as well as for lying about how she felt about the photo of him with Alison. Olivia notices his ring and begs him to use it to help her father, but he refuses. He leaves Olivia in the stairwell alone after she refuses to go home with him."

        "Livvie: Lucy, there has to be something that we can do. I'm not going to accept this. There has to be an operation or therapy or something. It can't be true that my father will never walk again.",
        "Lucy: We don't know that's true. We just have to wait, Livvie. We have to wait and see.",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm tired of waiting. There must be something else.",
        "Lucy: Livvie --",
        "Livvie: I need -- I need to know what's happening. Has there been any changes?",
        "Chris: I'm afraid not. We're still waiting for the cord swelling to subside.",
        "Ian: It's still going to take a couple days before we know the full extent of the damage.",
        "Lucy: You mean if -- if he might be paralyzed.",
        "Ian: Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.",
        "Livvie: No, that's not going to happen.",
        "Lucy: It's just the waiting -- you know, not knowing what's happening -- that's really hard.",
        "Ian: I just want you to be prepared, that's all.",
        "Lucy: Ok.",
        "Chris: Ian's right. You know, there's still a chance he's going to be ok.",
        "Lucy: A chance? What do you mean? How much of a chance?",
        "Lucy: Kevin? Hey.",
        "[Kevin grunts]",
        "Lucy: It's ok. You're in -- you're in the hospital. You're going to be ok.",
        "Kevin: I can't move. I can't move! What happened to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for it to be you. I never wanted to hurt you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I can't believe you knew.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Rafe: I can't believe you knew the ring had that power and you kept that from me.",
        "Jamal: Look, I said I was sorry, all right?",
        "Rafe: And you know what, we're all going to be sorry if Caleb gets a hold of it. What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Jamal: I thought I could deal with it, dude.",
        "Rafe: By what? By throwing it in the river?",
        "Jamal: I didn't think that the ring would swim its way back to shore and find its way back, ok?",
        "Rafe: Well, I guess you underestimated its power, huh?",
        "Jamal: Look, you know, I can't undo what's already been done, so we might as well just stop, ok? But I can help you.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Jamal: Christina said that she lost the ring at the gym --",
        "Rafe: Right.",
        "Jamal: So maybe it's still there. Maybe no one's found it yet.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, you know what, it better be.",
        "Jamal: Well, you know --",
        "Caleb: My guess would be that you're too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Ah. It was right there the whole time.",
        "Rafe: Congratulations. You won the prize.",
        "Jamal: Not for long.",
        "Rafe: Wait, what are you doing? No, don't do anything stupid.",
        "Jamal: What are you talking about? He's got the ring right there.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, and you're a vampire, all right? That means you can't go anywhere near him. So can you please just go? This is between us.",
        "Jamal: I'll hang out right here.",
        "Rafe: Jamal, go, please!",
        "Jamal: I'll hang out right here.",
        "Caleb: I hate to admit it, but he is right, J.",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caleb: There's nothing you can do. And now that I'm back, I'm going to remember who was naughty and who was nice. You should never have taken what didn't belong to you.",
        "Jamal: Well, I still think the best place for that ring is at the bottom of the river where I put it. And someday it's going to be right back at the bottom of the river with a finger attached to it, all right?",
        "Caleb: He seems upset.",
        "Rafe: So? What's the great Caleb's first wish going to be?",
        "Caleb: So you think you know the ring, that you've learned about it, but you haven't. The true secret of its power is in possessing it and not making foolish little wishes.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, you can say whatever you want, but I'm not going to feel safe till that ring is off your finger.",
        "Caleb: I know. You want it so bad you're willing to cut off my hand with that scalpel. What do you say you put that down before one of us gets hurt.",
        "Alison: Hey, Rafe, there you are.",
        "Rafe: Alison, stay back!",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Rafe: It's Caleb.",
        "Alison: What about him?",
        "Rafe: He's gone, isn't he?",
        "Alison: Um -- Rafe, I don't see him anywhere. Hey, why do you have a scalpel in your hand?",
        "Rafe: It's the ring. He's got it back.",
        "Alison: Well, what do you -- why do you have a scalpel? What are you doing?",
        "Rafe: I was going to cut the damn thing off his finger.",
        "Alison: Please don't tell me you were actually going to do that. Well, I'm glad that you didn't. And I'm also glad that Caleb has his own ring back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You were in a horrible accident last night at the fashion show. One of the -- the big lights from the show fell and landed on you.",
        "Kevin: I remember that.",
        "Lucy: But you're going to be fine. You're going to pull through this. Everything's going to be just fine. You're going to be all right.",
        "Kevin: Where was the damage?",
        "Ian: You got a small fracture on your vertebrae.",
        "Kevin: What does the C.T. Show?",
        "Chris: There was a questionable small bleed in the right parietal region. Other than that, it was negative.",
        "Kevin: Well, that explains this headache.",
        "Chris: Well, we can get you something for that.",
        "Kevin: I want to see x-rays.",
        "Chris: Well, there's not much to see. You have a hairline fracture of C7 with possible cord contusion.",
        "Ian: And you're getting steroids to minimize the swelling, but we won't know for a few days to see what the injury was.",
        "Chris: Yeah. But the C.T. Really does look great, you know, except for that questionable area, which I'm confident --",
        "Kevin: Let's cut to the chase, shall we? What we're talking about is the likelihood that I'll be paralyzed permanently, aren't we?",
        "Ian: Yeah, that's what we're saying.",
        "Kevin: Ok, obviously the next step is a neuro consult.",
        "Ian: Dr. Light's on the way.",
        "Kevin: She's good. She's as good as they come.",
        "Lucy: Ian insisted on just the best -- Dr. Light.",
        "Kevin: Thanks for that. But I think you and I would both be more comfortable if you'd remove yourself from the case.",
        "Lucy: No. I don't think so.",
        "Ian: I do. I think he's right.",
        "Lucy: Ian would do his very best.",
        "Kevin: He's a good doctor, Lucy, but he shouldn't be mine. Understand? What about Christina? I know she saw what happened.",
        "Lucy: Yes, she did, and she was pretty traumatized. So I allowed her to stay at the hospital all this time, and she's with Jamal and Imani.",
        "Kevin: I want to see her.",
        "Ian: I'll see if I can track them down.",
        "Kevin: Thank you.",
        "Chris: You know, I know things look bad right now, but there's -- there's still --",
        "Kevin: I appreciate what you're doing, Chris. I don't need my hand held.",
        "Chris: I know. I'll check back on you later.",
        "Lucy: Thanks, Chris.",
        "Kevin: And as for you, don't look at me like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: God, this isn't happening. I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Caleb: What have you heard?",
        "Livvie: It's horrible. Why did this have to happen?",
        "Caleb: Oh, I think we both know why it happened, and I'm guessing you know how.",
        "Livvie: What are you talking about?",
        "Caleb: He wasn't supposed to be on that stage. Alison was.",
        "Livvie: Why are you saying that? Who cares who -- who cares? It doesn't make a difference who was supposed to be there. My father is suffering right now.",
        "Caleb: You tried to set Alison up. Your father got in the way.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Caleb: You heard me. You did this to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: So, how's she doing?",
        "Imani: Poor thing finally dropped off. Is Dr. Collins ok?",
        "Jamal: No, no, I haven't heard anything.",
        "Imani: So what's wrong? What's the matter?",
        "Jamal: Nothing. What makes you think something's wrong?",
        "Imani: I don't know, you seem a little upset.",
        "Jamal: No. No. I'm cool. I'm fine.",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Jamal: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Ian: Looks like you guys found a nice, quiet spot for yourselves.",
        "Imani: Yeah, how's Dr. Collins?",
        "Ian: He's awake and alert, but that's about all we know.",
        "Jamal: Good.",
        "Christina: Ian?",
        "Ian: Hey. Guess what.",
        "Christina: My daddy's all better?",
        "Ian: He -- he wants to see you. He asked me to come find you. Thanks for watching her.",
        "Imani: Oh, any time. She's an angel.",
        "Jamal: No problem. Do you want us to stick around or anything?",
        "Ian: No, I think we're ok.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Imani: All right. Well, give Dr. Collins our best, will you?",
        "Ian: I will. Thanks again.",
        "Christina: Let's go see daddy.",
        "Ian: Yeah, we will in a second. Let's go have a juice first, ok? Your mommy and daddy are talking.",
        "Christina: I said my prayers.",
        "Ian: Did you? I'm sure they'll help. I'm sure they will. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, I just can't stand the look of pity in your eyes.",
        "Lucy: I was not looking at you with any pity because I'm not pitying you. I was trying to think of a way to remind you what Ian and Chris said. You have a very good chance you will be ok.",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I'm a doctor. I understand the damage and I understand my odds. And in all likelihood, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair.",
        "Lucy: No. You might in a few weeks be out on some basketball court somewhere going one-on-one with --",
        "Kevin: With who? With Ian?",
        "Lucy: You didn't hear them say \"wheelchair.\" That word was not mentioned. They never said \"rest of your life.\" You didn't hear that.",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm pretty darn good at reading between the lines.",
        "Lucy: Don't let yourself down like that. You have to stay strong and you have to have faith that you're going to get better so that you will. And you still -- you still have feeling on your right side, doc. That's not gone. So, please, you know that you have to keep a positive attitude for a really strong recovery.",
        "Kevin: Boy, of all the patients I've sold that to. Now when it comes to me --",
        "Lucy: Don't -- don't do that. Come on.",
        "Kevin: You know what else? Here I've been telling you that Ian couldn't possibly give you the life you deserve. Now I probably couldn't do it, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Um, ok. Not sure I believe what I'm hearing. You actually think it's a good thing that Caleb has his ring back?",
        "Alison: Well, yes, I do. I don't actually care about the ring, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: No?",
        "Alison: I'm just glad that this war is finally over between the two of you. You guys can separate and now we can actually have some peace.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, you know what, it's not quite that simple. See, I know what the ring does now. It has a power beyond anything we ever imagined.",
        "Alison: What do you mean? What does it do?",
        "Rafe: It grants wishes.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe: It can give Caleb anything that sick brain of his can dream up.",
        "Alison: Well, Caleb had that ring forever, right? And when Joshua had it, I mean, he tried to create hell on earth.",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ok. What's your point?",
        "Alison: What my point is, is that if Caleb was actually going to use it for things that you're suggesting, that kind of a danger, then he would've already done that. At least we can trust him that he's not going to go completely crazy with the ring, right?",
        "Rafe: Trust him?",
        "Alison: And if it were to fall in the hands of a vampire like Joshua --",
        "Rafe: Do you actually think that Caleb has changed that much that he wouldn't use his power against us?",
        "Alison: Rafe --",
        "Rafe: Is that what you think?",
        "Alison: I have to believe that in order for this war to be over. That is a risk that I am willing to take.",
        "Rafe: Alison, I love you. But you are living in a dream world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: That's why all this happened. You were trying to hurt Alison.",
        "Livvie: I didn't want to kill her. I just wanted to ruin her show, her -- her fashion show, Caleb. She made me so mad!",
        "Caleb: It didn't matter to you that I had a plan --",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry!",
        "Caleb: The same evening?",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry --",
        "Caleb: By sabotaging Alison, you sabotaged me.",
        "Livvie: I didn't want to. I didn't want to. I just wanted to warn her. I wanted to warn her --",
        "Caleb: Warn her?",
        "Livvie: To stay away from you. When I saw the picture in the paper, the two of you, it just made me so mad!",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you know what? You also told me you understood that!",
        "Livvie: But it hurts. It hurts.",
        "Caleb: You lied to me. Do you understand that? You lied to me!",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. I love you. I -- I get crazy sometimes. I'm sorry. Please -- please, I'm sorry. Your ring. Oh, my god. Caleb, you got your ring back!",
        "Caleb: Don't -- don't even --",
        "Livvie: You got your ring back! Do you know what this means? You can help my father. You can make this all go away. You can just make a wish and it'll go away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You know, I don't mean to sound like I'm feeling sorry for myself, but at this particular moment I don't have a whole lot of positives to hang on to.",
        "Lucy: You're wrong. You have two very important positives. You have two beautiful daughters who love you very much. And you have yourself back. You have your sanity back and the very real possibility that you are going to be ok.",
        "Kevin: You know, I really thought I was on the right track. I was making amends, I was atoning for my sins. And it's like god said, \"no, Kevin, it doesn't work like that. You have to pay for what you've done.\"",
        "Lucy: I don't think the universe works like that at all.",
        "Ian: You've got a visitor who's anxious to see you.",
        "Christina: Daddy, daddy!",
        "Kevin: Hey, honey.",
        "Ian: How's it going?",
        "Lucy: It's ok. It's fine.",
        "Ian: I'll give you guys some time.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Kevin: Honey, I don't want you to worry about all this stuff you see. This is all to make daddy better, and I'm going to be just fine.",
        "Christina: When can you leave?",
        "Kevin: I'm not sure yet, honey.",
        "Lucy: Daddy has to spend just some time here to make sure he's all better.",
        "Christina: Can daddy come home with us so we can make him well? Can he, mommy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: You were really great with Christina. I can tell she likes you a lot.",
        "Imani: Yeah, she's a sweet little girl. I really hope everything's ok with her dad.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Man: Hey, look, just stay back. Um -- I'm not taking any more pictures.",
        "Imani: Photographer from the fashion show. I guess he knows I'm a little camera shy.",
        "Jamal: Oh, a little? I saw what you did to his camera, the way you grabbed it and yanked out your film and everything.",
        "Imani: Well, I can't -- I can't afford to take any chances. I cannot be found.",
        "Jamal: Hey, I understand completely, ok? Just remind me never to get on your bad side. Oh, and just to let you know, that offer's still out there if you want to move into my apartment, just to be safe.",
        "Imani: Thanks, Jamal, but I really don't think that's going to be necessary.",
        "Jamal: Ok. I'm just saying, if you ever change your mind, it's just always there.",
        "Imani: I'll tell you what -- I would feel a whole lot safer if you would walk me to work.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Are you going to do it? Are you -- are you going to help -- help me help my dad? Are you going to do that?",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry. What's done is done.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, so undo it. Caleb, undo it! You have the power to do or undo anything you want! I want you to help my father. If you love me, you'll do it.",
        "Caleb: If I love you? I'm sorry. This is you, sweetheart. This is all you, and your father is going to have to live with the consequences.",
        "Livvie: So what are you saying? What, are you trying to teach me a lesson? What are you --",
        "Caleb: Is that even possible? You have made so many mistakes of late, I am beginning to wonder if --",
        "Livvie: If what? If what? If what, I'm worth it? So what you're saying is you're refusing to help me.",
        "Caleb: It's been a long night. Let's just go home.",
        "Livvie: No. I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Caleb: As you wish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Tell me, Rafe, what is so wrong with wanting peace?",
        "Rafe: You mean, at any cost? I don't know. I'm not sure. It's just -- you can't just close your eyes and hope that evil will just disappear.",
        "Alison: Look, I know that -- that Caleb has done some really awful things in the past. I know that.",
        "Rafe: In the past? You think it's all in the past? You think that vampire has actually grown a conscience?",
        "Alison: I don't know that. I don't. But I have to believe that in order for me to believe that this war is actually coming to an end.",
        "Rafe: I can't believe this. You -- you keep doing this constantly. You forget who this guy really is. I mean, he made us think we were brother and sister so we couldn't get married. He tore Livvie in half just so she would love him. And once upon a time, he stole Ian's kid just because he couldn't have one of his own.",
        "Alison: Look, I really don't think that he's the same person. I don't, and I know that sounds crazy --",
        "Rafe: Listen to me, listen to me. Caleb wants what he wants, and he's going to do anything to get it. So we can't just let him just ride off into the sunset with his magic ring with Livvie! Do you want to give Livvie that kind of power?",
        "Alison: Ok, I -- I see your point. You made it loud and clear. It's just --",
        "Rafe: It's just that we have to deal with the reality of the situation here. Ok? And the reality is that I can't let Caleb keep that ring. I have to get it back, whatever it takes. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",
