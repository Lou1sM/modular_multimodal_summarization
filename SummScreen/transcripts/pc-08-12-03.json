    "Recap": [
        "Jack apologizes to Reese and tries to explain the ring's role in their relationship problems, but it just makes things worse. After Ricky denies that he still sees Casey, Reese finds him with his invisible girlfriend and orders her to leave Ricky alone. Lucy finds herself incapable of denying Christina's request to have Kevin live with them, but Ian doesn't like the idea at all. After hearing Lucy's reasons for wanting to grant Christina's wish, Ian agrees to go along with it. Olivia informs Kevin that he will be staying with her and Caleb, making it clear that she wants his help with Caleb in return. Sick of her egocentrism, Kevin calls her on her behavior and declines her offer to stay at the loft. Horribly offended by his accusation that she's only thinking of herself, Olivia runs out, crying. Lucy and Ian officially invite Kevin to stay with them. After spontaneously kissing Chris, Elizabeth slaps the bewildered man and warns him never to take advantage of her that way again."

        "Jack: This was growing mold waiting for you, man.",
        "Reese: Ow!",
        "Ricky: Jeez, are you all right?",
        "Reese: Are you ok?",
        "Ricky: So sorry. Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Reese: Are you sure? You've been off in your own world for days after everything was going so great.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, I wouldn't exactly call it great.",
        "Reese: You've been seeing Casey again, haven't you?",
        "Ricky: Me? No, please, are you kidding me? No, I've been busy with other stuff, rehearsal and stuff like that, all right? Look, trust me, I'm pulling it together, really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, baby, looking good.",
        "Ricky: No. No, no, no. You're not really here, ok? Last time you said you were gone for good, so this is not really you in the flesh.",
        "Casey: Well, then there's what I say, and then, of course, there's what I do, right?",
        "Ricky: So why are you doing this to me?",
        "Casey: Because being away from you turns out not being an option?",
        "Ricky: You show up out of nowhere --",
        "Casey: Uh-huh?",
        "Ricky: And then you never stay.",
        "Casey: Never stay. Ok, well, maybe this time it'll be different. I mean, unless, of course, you want me to go. I can go.",
        "Ricky: No.",
        "Casey: No? No, I didn't think so.",
        "Ricky: What do you want from me?",
        "Casey: Baby, I want to have fun, ok? Let's party, ok? I'm so sick of seeing you mope around. You have got to lighten up, rhythm boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Coffee, please.",
        "Jack: Here or to go?",
        "Reese: To go, of course. Ricky's waiting for me outside to strip my clothes off and shag him on the bench outside. Is that all right?",
        "Jack: Ok, ok, Reese, Reese, Reese, stop. Look, I -- if I could apologize six different ways, I would.",
        "Reese: Try me.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry I said anything about you and Ricky's relationship.",
        "Reese: Go on.",
        "Jack: Well, I really like you, and I think we have a really good thing --",
        "Reese: Had, Jack. We had something.",
        "Jack: Ok, ok. Just try to understand this. You were really into me, right?",
        "Reese: Oh, here we go again.",
        "Jack: No, no, don't you find that weird? I mean, it's like it wasn't real. Reese, it was because of Caleb's ring.",
        "Reese: What ring?",
        "Jack: The other night, I had this ring, and I made a wish that maybe you'd become less interested in me. I mean, don't you get it?",
        "Reese: Oh. So you wished that I'd get lost? That's nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Extra, extra, read all about it.",
        "Chris: I already did over morning coffee. [French accent] Yes, \"Georges' designs are fun and flirty with a funky edge that's seldom seen in workout gear.\"",
        "Elizabeth: They loved us.",
        "Chris: [Normal voice] No, they loved you. I'm just back to being my old doctor self, a doctor with a paralyzed patient.",
        "Elizabeth: Kevin? Is it really awful to at least feel a little relieved that the show was over before he got hurt?",
        "Chris: Yeah, that's really awful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You tried to set Alison up. Your father got in the way.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Caleb: You heard me. You did this to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: Please, can daddy stay with us?",
        "Kevin: Honey? You know that daddy has a really nice home of his own up there at the lighthouse with his own stuff and his own bed.",
        "Christina: Like your paints?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, honey. Just like my -- my paints.",
        "Lucy: Kevin --",
        "Kevin: No, Lucy, just --",
        "Christina: Does it hurt?",
        "Kevin: As long as you're looking at me, nothing hurts.",
        "Christina: See? Daddy has to come home with us so we can make him all better.",
        "Lucy: You're right. Christina's right.",
        "Kevin: That's ridiculous, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: You need your daughter to make a full recovery, and she needs you to get over this. She needs to see that you're ok. So -- I guess it's settled then. You are moving in.",
        "Kevin: Not quite, Lucy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christina: Ian, daddy's going to come and live with us.",
        "Ian: So I hear.",
        "Lucy: We need to talk to Ian, and we need to tell your daddy goodbye for now.",
        "Kevin: You know what, honey? A kiss would be the best medicine of all.",
        "Lucy: Ok, come here, you. Let's give daddy a big kiss, shall we?",
        "Christina: I love you, daddy.",
        "Kevin: I love you, too, honey.",
        "Lucy: Ok. We're going to be back real soon for a visit, all right?",
        "Livvie: Uh-uh-uh! Wait a minute. Let me help you.",
        "Kevin: It's a good thing you're here. There's no way I could get to it, anyway.",
        "Livvie: Hi. How are you, daddy?",
        "Kevin: Hmm. Oh, well, all my girls coming to see me? How does it get any better than this? It's not my best day, honey.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I -- I think I'm just going to shed a little light on that situation and just always remember that it could have been a lot worse now, right?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I guess it could be worse. I could've been killed. I mean, that would be considered worse than the prospect of spending the rest of my life in a wheelchair. But hey, the jury's still out.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, of course it is. And there's so much you can do still, daddy. I mean, wait, your painting, for starters.",
        "Kevin: I'm left-handed, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: I want to help you. Daddy, I will. I'm so sorry.",
        "Kevin: Honey, it's not your fault. I'm going to be ok.",
        "Livvie: Yes, you will, because I am going to help you get better. In fact, before -- before you check out here, I'm going to have you all moved in.",
        "Kevin: Moved in?",
        "Livvie: Yeah. You're going to come live with me and Caleb. Daddy, we'll take care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Christina was so happy to see Kevin talking and alert that she allowed Gail to take her to the park, and Carmen's got Danny. They're going to meet them there.",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: Ok, um -- I -- I know --",
        "Ian: No, don't. I'm just getting used to the idea of a houseguest, that's all.",
        "Lucy: I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have just blurted out that it was ok for him to come stay with us. But when my little girl's looking up at me, asking if her daddy can get better by coming to stay with us, I sort of -- I don't know, it just seemed that I had to say yes. It seemed like a rational thing to do at the time.",
        "Ian: She's 4, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I know. I know she's 4.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. But given that she's 4, she felt like she could ask because maybe she just doesn't understand unacceptable behavior or what has to be appropriate or --",
        "Ian: But you do, right? You still do it, don't you? Ok. I don't want Kevin living with us.",
        "Lucy: I understand that. I don't want him living with us, either. But you -- you know that it's not just a physical recovery for a patient. You need more than that.",
        "Ian: As a doctor, I do understand that, yeah. But as a man, I know who he is to you and I know who you are to him.",
        "Lucy: Who he was, who I was. In the past. It's all about Christina. She somehow is magic for him. When she walks in the room, his whole face lights up. She could help him get better.",
        "Ian: You want all of us to live in the same house?",
        "Lucy: No, that's not what I want. But you have to tell me you know the difference between calling Danny in New York on the phone and telling him good night versus being able to rock him in your arms.",
        "Ian: What are you doing? That's not fair. Don't do that.",
        "Lucy: I know it's not fair and I shouldn't be doing it, but it's the truth. You know that a child's love is the best cure in the world.",
        "Ian: What about you?",
        "Lucy: What about me?",
        "Ian: Kevin's in for the fight of his life. And you're willing to turn your life and everyone in it upside down.",
        "Lucy: I don't -- i don't want to do this. I just -- somehow, i feel like i owe him that much.",
        "Ian: This is going to get bigger than any of us, I promise you.",
        "Lucy: And I promise you I won't let it. It cannot get bigger than us, what we have. I just don't know what else to do. He doesn't have anybody. He can't turn to Livvie. I can't find Victor. I can't get his help. So I just -- I don't want Kevin to have to face all this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I never wished for you to get lost.",
        "Reese: Well, you're going to need a really big shovel to dig yourself out of this one.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know, I know. You kind of came on a little strong, you know, about the whole key business, wanting to move into my house.",
        "Reese: It seemed practical, Jack.",
        "Jack: I know. It was really selfish of me and I wish I could go back and change it. But I didn't, and I had no idea that that ring was going to make my wish come true.",
        "Reese: What kind of con are you trying to pull, Jack?",
        "Jack: No, Reese, it's Caleb's ring. Think about it.",
        "Reese: Oh, and you were just spouting off? You had no clue?",
        "Jack: None.",
        "Reese: Well, obviously, you still don't have a clue because you're so bloody sexy and irresistible, a girl would need a magic ring to lose interest in you.",
        "Jack: Ok, I deserve that one, too.",
        "Reese: No, you have no idea what you deserve. It hasn't even begun yet. And you're not going to need a magic ring to find out, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You know, it seems like ever since I blew out of this joint, all you've been doing is moping around and playing your drums. Honey, it's -- it's pretty sad.",
        "Ricky: Oh, yeah?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Ricky: Is that right? Well, you know what, it's mostly your fault.",
        "Casey: Ok, my bad. I'll own up to that. So if I broke it, then let me fix it.",
        "Ricky: And how are you going to do that?",
        "Casey: Come play with me. Let's have some fun. Let's heat things up around here.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, yeah, I know how to do that.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know you do. Hot and dangerous, like we used to. Make our ways dangerously.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, yeah, like how we got sent to jail, huh?",
        "Casey: Oh, that's what I'm talking about! You know, somewhere in this backwater, sweetie -- oh, god --",
        "Ricky: Mmm.",
        "Casey: There is trouble, there is trouble, and it is screaming for us to find it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I know what you're thinking.",
        "Chris: Yeah, perish the thought.",
        "Elizabeth: No, it's not true. I mean, it's just been a long time since something really good has happened to me. It wasn't easy just to sit there and let you take all the credit for my designs.",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no, Georges took the credit, not me. And you were very generous about it.",
        "Elizabeth: Story of my life, never given credit where credit's due.",
        "Chris: Yes, and always having to make a lot of noise just so people notice you.",
        "Elizabeth: You do know me.",
        "Chris: Yeah. A beautiful woman, rarely appreciated. But I've got to tell you, you did a heck of a job with this.",
        "Elizabeth: And thank you for being such a wonderful Georges.",
        "Chris: Oh, of course.",
        "Elizabeth: I'm going to miss him.",
        "Chris: [French accent] Yeah, well, you know, Georges had to catch a plane to Milan. Ciao, Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Ciao, Georges. Hello, Chris.",
        "Chris: [Normal voice] What?",
        "Elizabeth: Don't ever do that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: I understand how -- I understand that you think you're the one person that can help Kevin through this again. I get it. What I have a tough time getting my mind around is him sleeping down the hall from us, thinking of you.",
        "Lucy: You're right. Every single thing you said is absolutely right. But this is about Christina, too, because what she saw happen to her daddy was horrific, and if I can make it better for her in anyway, then I want to do that. I'm not asking you --",
        "Ian: I know what you're asking me. And there's a good chance that he will be paralyzed. And if you think that it'll be easier for Christina, then, yes, he should live with us.",
        "Lucy: I didn't think that it would ever be possible to fall in love with you more than I already have. But I just did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You know, that's the second offer I've had in a matter of minutes.",
        "Livvie: Who else asked you?",
        "Kevin: Lucy did.",
        "Livvie: Lucy? Isn't she still living with Ian?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yeah, but --",
        "Livvie: No, daddy, you are not moving in with Lucy and Ian. You will be much happier with me and Caleb.",
        "Kevin: You know, Livvie, I don't think --",
        "Livvie: It'll be great, dad. I will take care of you and I will make sure you get better and I will cook you food and make sure you take your medicine, and then -- well, maybe you could help me, too.",
        "Kevin: Help you what?",
        "Livvie: I didn't want to burden you with this because you are obviously going through a lot and have a lot on your mind, but Caleb and I really haven't been getting along lately.",
        "Kevin: That so?",
        "Livvie: The truth is, dad, I think this would be as good for me as it would be for you. I mean, I know you and Caleb really don't like each other that much, but he does have a lot of respect for you, and given what you're going through, if you would just take the time to talk to him, maybe, I mean, you would be able to get to him, you know, maybe tell him that I'm hurting, you know? You would do that for me, wouldn't you, daddy? I mean, you are a shrink. You must be able to see what I'm going through.",
        "Kevin: Actually, Livvie, I've been a little preoccupied wondering if I'm ever going to be able to walk again.",
        "Livvie: Well, I am in a lot of pain, you know, a lot like you.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, that situation you're in with Caleb? You invited that in. You could walk away if you chose to. That's not so easy for me. I won't be moving in with you, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I love you. I want to take care of you.",
        "Kevin: You know, based on what I'm seeing right now, I seriously doubt that you're even capable of it. What you want to do is use my condition to manipulate Caleb. You have taken the \"it's all about me\" syndrome to a whole new level.",
        "Livvie: I can't believe you would attack me like this. God, that is such an awful thing to say.",
        "Lucy: What was that all about?",
        "Kevin: Oh, the usual -- all about Livvie.",
        "Lucy: You look pretty worn out.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, I'm just trying to get my priorities straight. Look, you two both know that this is a bad idea. I'm not going to move in with you.",
        "Ian: Yes, you will. I insist on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: I can't believe that you just took advantage of me like that.",
        "Chris: Neither can I?",
        "Elizabeth: So help me, if you ever try anything like that again --",
        "Chris: What, you're going to slap me I bet, right?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, and you'll deserve it.",
        "Chris: Well, wait a second. Wait, wait, what the hell is wrong with you? You just kissed me.",
        "Elizabeth: I kissed -- what? You know, until recently, I barely even liked you a little bit. So if you're starting to think that I'm somehow remotely attracted to you --",
        "Chris: Well, don't worry because the feeling's mutual.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, fine, because just -- you know, just remember --",
        "Chris: No, I will remember, Sybil, believe me.",
        "Elizabeth: Ugh.",
        "Chris: You saw that, right? She kissed me. She kissed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Look, you wanted me out of your life. Now you can watch me walk right out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: You know what? You are so right.",
        "Casey: Of course I'm right.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, you know, all work and no play makes Ricky a dull boy, so let's have some fun, all right? Let's do something about it.",
        "Casey: And that's my drummer boy.",
        "Ricky: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Reese: Ricky?",
        "Casey: Oh, man.",
        "Ricky: Oh, hey.",
        "Reese: You're doing it again. You're talking to Casey.",
        "Casey: Baby, ignore her, ok? She's just trying to ruin our fun. Come on, let's get out of here.",
        "Ricky: All right, you know what, give me a second.",
        "Reese: This is ridiculous. You're talking to nothing, to thin air.",
        "Ricky: What are you talking about? She's right here.",
        "Reese: Oh, yeah? Well, come on then! Show yourself! If you've got the guts! Or better yet, actually, why don't you just go back to heaven or hell or wherever it is that you're from and leave Ricky alone! Do you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: You insist that I move in with Lucy?",
        "Ian: And me.",
        "Kevin: You know, that picnic the other day was one thing. It was -- pretty uncomfortable. A couple of hours, maybe too much wine for one day, but I'm fighting for my life here. I have no idea what the future even holds for me.",
        "Lucy: We know that.",
        "Ian: The only thing that matters is your well-being.",
        "Kevin: Wow.",
        "Lucy: Do this for yourself and for Christina.",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, you know, I'm hardly in a position to say no to that, am I?",
        "Lucy: No, you're not. And I don't know why, but this -- it's just the right thing to do. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Chalres: The Gift\"--",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Casey: Drop this loser because you belong to me, right?",
        "Alison: You're going to go talk to Lucy about getting the ring back, aren't you?",
        "Rafe: I'll be back before you know I'm gone.",
        "Caleb: All this would be easier if I didn't love you.",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm about to make your life a little easier then.",
        "Caleb: You're not going anywhere. You're coming with me."
