When Reese is unable to reason with Ricky about his obsession with Casey, she enlists Jack's help. Ricky pretends to go along with Jack's suggestion to get a beer together, saying that he'll be there in a minute. Jamal doesn't understand Imani's refusal to get on his bike. He talks her into taking a look at it, but Ricky is driving off on it as they step outside. Jack and Reese have a pleasant drink together. Caleb whisks Olivia back to the loft, where he gives her an ultimatum. He is furious with her for following her own agenda when getting the ring back was so important to him. He demands that she either control her jealousy or prepare to spend eternity alone. Olivia cries that Alison just makes her crazy, but she promises not to let her get to her anymore. Caleb informs her that this is her last chance. Getting an idea, she takes off to do something for their relationship. Because of what happened to Kevin, Alison feels guilty about the gym's success. Although Rafe is determined to get the ring away from Caleb, he allows himself to be charmed and seduced by the woman he loves. While he sleeps, she leaves him a note and goes to visit Caleb."

        "Reese: I said why don't you go back to heaven or hell or wherever it is that you're from and leave Ricky alone! Do you think she got the message this time?",
        "Ricky: Mm-hmm, yep, yep, loud and clear, and she's not a happy camper.",
        "Casey: Oh, guess what, big mouth -- even though I'm 100% angel, if you do not step off on my boy, I will take off my halo and kick your skanky little butt away.",
        "Ricky: Wow, wow, wow. She is mad at you now. In fact, she's got a few choice names for you.",
        "Reese: Ricky, if she's talking to me, why is it that I can't hear her?",
        "Casey: She does not have her grubby little paws on -- Ricky, that is not cool -- Ricky --",
        "Ricky: Whoa, baby, wait a minute, chill, chill Casey, chill, chill.",
        "Casey: You know what? You need to drop this loser because you belong to me, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Rafe: Hi. Hi. I'm just going to go out for a bit. You ok?",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, I'm ok. I was just -- I'm a little tired. The phones have been ringing off the hook. Do you know that our memberships have totally doubled since the fashion show?",
        "Rafe: That's great.",
        "Alison: I'm kind of feeling a little guilty with Kevin and all.",
        "Rafe: Kevin's going to be ok, all right? I'm going to go to the hospital now and check on his progress and see how Lucy's doing, all right?",
        "Alison: Oh, ok. Well, I'll come with you. I'll get my purse.",
        "Rafe: No. I'm just -- you know, you should stay here and answer the phones. I want to talk to Lucy alone anyway.",
        "Alison: Oh ok ok. You're going to go talk to Lucy about getting the ring back, aren't you, not just checking on Kevin.",
        "Rafe: I'll be back before you know I'm gone.",
        "Alison: Ok. Can I have a kiss before you go?",
        "Rafe: Yes.",
        "Alison: Sorry, Rafe. You're actually not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I want a drink. Something strong, please.",
        "Jack: How strong?",
        "Livvie: Oh, god, Jack. Another one of my fan club members, huh?",
        "Jack: Livvie, if you want a bar where people are going to love you, you can go on down the road. But if you want some tequila, we have some pretty good stuff that has not been watered down. It's pretty potent.",
        "Livvie: Make it a double, please.",
        "Jack: A double it is for Olivia Locke. So I'm taking it you and Caleb had a fight?",
        "Livvie: That is none of your business.",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Livvie: And I went to see my father.",
        "Jack: Yeah? How's he doing?",
        "Livvie: He's good enough to get all over my case, and he said some really hurtful things to me, which is great. But --",
        "Jack: But what?",
        "Livvie: I'm really glad that you're here for me.",
        "Jack: In other words, I'm the only one left speaking to you.",
        "Livvie: Why is that, Jack? Why does everyone hate me?",
        "Jack: Well, do you have a few hours or --",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's very funny. Kick me while I'm down, why don't you?",
        "Jack: You don't get it, do you, Livvie? People hate you because you stab people in the back. You do hateful things to them. That's the truth.",
        "Reese: Jack, Ricky's flipping out. I need your help.",
        "Jack: Oh, god, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky --",
        "Livvie: Yeah, hello, I'm here. I'm invisible then, huh? Great.",
        "Jack: Hey, Jamal, look, can you watch after things here? I got an emergency outside.",
        "Jamal: We cool?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Jamal: All right, all right. No problem. Hmm. Hey --",
        "Imani: Where's jack? I have a question about a drink special --",
        "Jamal: Oh, Jack -- he just left. But you got to deal with me now because I'm the man in charge.",
        "Imani: Oh, you're the man, huh?",
        "Jamal: That's right, baby. Think you can handle that?",
        "Livvie: It's official -- beat-up-on-Livvie night. First, my dad, then Caleb, Jack. I'm just batting a thousand here. What are you doing here?",
        "Caleb: What are you doing, Olivia?",
        "Livvie: You know what, Caleb? You were the one person that was supposed to be there for me, the one person that I thought would love me always, no matter what! I was wrong.",
        "Caleb: All this would be easier if I didn't love you.",
        "Livvie: I'm about to make your life a lot easier.",
        "Caleb: You're not going anywhere. You're coming with me.",
        "Livvie: Let me go! Stop it! Now, what the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Caleb: What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: On, wait a minute. I thought angels were supposed to be all peaceful and stuff.",
        "Casey: Oh, you know. It's -- oh, damn. Looks like the witch has landed and now she's brought backup.",
        "Ricky: I'll handle this, baby. Just chill for a second, all right?",
        "Casey: Ok, you tell them.",
        "Jack: Oh, Ricky. Who are you talking to, bro?",
        "Ricky: I'm out here minding my own business. You got a problem with that, Jack?",
        "Jack: Actually, Reese was telling me you're out here talking to your dead girlfriend.",
        "Ricky: Free country, bro. I can talk to whoever I want.",
        "Jack: What's going on, dude? You're freaking us out.",
        "Ricky: What are you, my mother? Did I get all in your face when you started hanging out with vampires?",
        "Casey: That's a good one, baby. Tell him, tell him.",
        "Ricky: Thanks.",
        "Jack: So, is Casey around here right now? I mean, am I stepping on her? Is there a password that makes her come out or what?",
        "Ricky: I'm warning you, Jack. Leave us alone, all right? We're cool.",
        "Jack: Well, I guess it's really none of our business.",
        "Ricky: Come on, baby. Let's go find a party where people are actually a little friendly, you know?",
        "Casey: Losers -- ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You are completely out of control.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know. Sometimes I get jealous. Sorry.",
        "Caleb: You lash out without any thought at all, and that is a very dangerous way for our kind to operate.",
        "Livvie: \"Our kind\"? What about you, Caleb? I know Alison and Rafe are together, but please. Anytime she's around she comes batting her baby blues, and I don't see you turning in the opposite direction.",
        "Caleb: You just don't get it, do you? You have no idea how irritating this is to go over with you again and again and again.",
        "Livvie: Ok, fine! Then answer this -- if I'm so impossible and irritating, why the hell are you still here?",
        "Caleb: It'd be better if I didn't love you. But you are unlike any other woman, and you're in my blood.",
        "Livvie: Oh, why are we fighting when we could be making love?",
        "Caleb: No. Not this time.",
        "Livvie: Why? I thought you wanted me. Why?",
        "Caleb: Wanting you is going to be the end of me.",
        "Livvie: No. No, that is such a horrible thing to say. You didn't mean that.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I did.",
        "Livvie: No, no. Caleb, please. If something feels so good, how can it be so bad, huh? It feels good.",
        "Caleb: See this? You destroyed me once before, and that's something I'm not exactly dying to experience again.",
        "Livvie: That was the past, and I was confused. You know I would never betray you again. You know that.",
        "Caleb: You already did. You knew how important that ring was to me. But of course, your agenda is always going to be more important.",
        "Livvie: No, I wasn't thinking clearly. Caleb, please, I wasn't thinking.",
        "Caleb: Exactly.",
        "Livvie: What do you want me to say? I love you. I love you. You know that. I'm sorry, I love you. Please, please forgive me.",
        "Caleb: Not good enough, not good enough.",
        "Livvie: Please.",
        "Caleb: Not this time. This -- this obsession with Alison is like a stake through the heart for both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Give me the keys.",
        "Alison: Why don't you come get them yourself?",
        "Rafe: Ok, I can stay here for as long as you want, but eventually I'm going to have to go after that ring. Do you understand that?",
        "Alison: Will the world really end if you just let this one slide?",
        "Rafe: Well, you know, the thing is we don't know! All right, you know, do you understand? This ring, it's like a time bomb, all right? And if I could get it without a fight, I would do that. But do you understand what it's like to have the power to make wishes come true? I mean -- I mean, come on. Just give me the keys, ok? Just -- I need to do this.",
        "Alison: Look, I'll tell you what you should do.",
        "Rafe: Ok, I'm listening. What?",
        "Alison: Why don't you just come a little bit closer for a minute, ok?",
        "Rafe: Give me the keys.",
        "Alison: I think that you should stop thinking about all these vampires and the ring and everything, just for a little while. I just want you to be with me, just for one night. That's all I ask.",
        "Rafe: No, I can't stop. I can't stop.",
        "Alison: That's all I'm asking, Rafe. All I want and all I need is just to be close to you tonight.",
        "Rafe: What are you doing?",
        "Alison: What does it look like I'm doing?",
        "Rafe: You're making this really difficult.",
        "Alison: But it doesn't have to be difficult. Can be really easy. Maybe you can just go look for the ring tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "Imani: Come here. You spilled a little something, maestro.",
        "Jamal: I saw that. Ah, that's a little better.",
        "Imani: So, mechanic, bartender -- any other hidden talents?",
        "Jamal: In due time, my dear. All in due time. I can't drop a load on you all at once, because then I might completely blow you out of the water.",
        "Imani: Oh, really?",
        "Jamal: But as your boss and superior, I am ordering you to take a break with me.",
        "Imani: Yeah? Well, if it's an order --",
        "Jamal: That it is. I got my bike right outside. I'm going to take you for a spin, a ride of your lifetime, baby girl.",
        "Imani: No. No, no, no, no. No motorcycles.",
        "Jamal: Don't even worry about it. I'm a great driver. I do stunts and everything.",
        "Imani: No, I said no, Jamal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: What's your problem, man?",
        "Jack: What's my problem? Dude, you're out here talking to the wall. You're talking to ghosts. Maybe you should start hanging around your real friends instead of your imaginary ones.",
        "Ricky: Casey's as real to me as you are, Jack.",
        "Reese: Your grieving for your girlfriend is understandable, but you have to come to terms with losing her.",
        "Ricky: Well, I wouldn't keep losing her if you two genius didn't scare her off.",
        "Jack: If she was really here.",
        "Ricky: Look, she's an angel, all right? They do stuff like that. They appear and they disappear. Maybe she got a call to go help a little old lady cross a busy street.",
        "Reese: Are you listening to yourself? You're building your world around someone who's dead, gone.",
        "Ricky: So what do you care?",
        "Reese: Because I don't want to lose you, ok? As a member of the band, as someone who's your friend, who used to be more than a friend, I'm really scared that you're freaking out, and I'm not just going to stand back.",
        "Ricky: I'm not hurting anybody here, ok?",
        "Jack: Ok, ok, ok, maybe you're not. So why don't you come in, let me buy you a beer, and we can talk this out.",
        "Reese: Come on.",
        "Ricky: All right. Maybe I do need to sort some things out. Give me a minute, though. Come on, go.",
        "Jack: A cold one always helps.",
        "Casey: Ugh! Ha-ha! You can still run a decent con, baby. They bought it hook, line, and sinker.",
        "Ricky: Suckers, mm-hmm. Now, where were we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe's voice: I can stay here for as long as you want, but eventually I'm going to have to go after that ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Imagine your life without me.",
        "Livvie: I'd survive. I always have.",
        "Caleb: Yeah? You think you'd find someone else that understands you the way I do, that satisfies you the way I do?",
        "Livvie: So, we had a fight. We both probably said things that we really didn't mean, anyway. It's not the end of the world. Caleb, you really wouldn't leave me, would you? Because I'm not that great on my own. You know that.",
        "Caleb: And now you have the gift of eternity -- an eternity of being alone. I want you to think about that because that's what you're facing. And this wasn't a misunderstanding. I meant everything that I said.",
        "Livvie: I don't want to be alone. I don't. I want to be with you.",
        "Caleb: Then control your jealousy.",
        "Livvie: I would. It's just Alison --",
        "Caleb: Your worst enemy is you.",
        "Livvie: I know. I know. I don't know what it is. Anytime I hear her name or see her face or hear her voice, something inside of me, it just snaps.",
        "Caleb: You want to fight it.",
        "Livvie: It's because I'm afraid!",
        "Caleb: You have to fight it!",
        "Livvie: I am afraid that she is going to take away everything that I love, so I want to hurt her. I want to hurt her before she can hurt me.",
        "Caleb: You are fighting a war all by yourself with yourself.",
        "Livvie: I don't feel that way.",
        "Caleb: Then I guess we have nothing to talk about.",
        "Livvie: Oh, Caleb. You mean the world to me. Don't you know that? Nothing in this world means more to me than you, and I'm going to fix this. I am. I'm going to fix this.",
        "Caleb: I hope you can, because I'm through being patient with you.",
        "Livvie: I'm a strong woman. You know that. You know how strong I can be, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: This is your last chance, Olivia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Hey.",
        "Imani: Hey.",
        "Jamal: What's wrong with you? I just wanted to take you out for a quick spin on my bike, and you acted like I was trying to tell you to walk the plank or something.",
        "Imani: I know. I'm sorry. It's just motorcycles really aren't my thing.",
        "Jamal: Yeah? What, did you have, like, a bad experience on them or something?",
        "Imani: Something like that.",
        "Jamal: Yeah?",
        "Imani: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jamal: Well, at least, let me, you know, try to convince you with mine. I mean, I promise I'll take it slow and easy with you, all right? I won't do anything --",
        "Imani: You know what? I'm more the nice long walk type. If you have an activity that doesn't require a helmet, I'm so there.",
        "[Jamal sighs]",
        "Jamal: I can see my work's cut out for me, hmm.",
        "Imani: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jamal: Well, at least, you know, come out and take a look at my bike. You know what I'm saying? Make friends with her.",
        "Imani: \"Her\"?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Imani: Oh, it figures.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, she's a beauty. Come on. I mean, she doesn't hold a candle to you or anything like that, but, you know, she's sweet, she's sexy, you know, she doesn't give me any problems.",
        "[Imani laughs]",
        "Jamal: She's nice.",
        "Imani: Ok. One look.",
        "Jamal: Yeah?",
        "Imani: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Imani: All right.",

        "Reese: Well, I'm impressed. You can be a pretty decent guy.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey, hey, keep it down.",
        "Reese: No, I'm serious.",
        "Jack: Oh, no, I got to keep my --",
        "Reese: Not five minutes ago I dumped you. You didn't hesitate to come and help Me. Thanks.",
        "Jack: Well, I wish you were asking for something a little more personal, like, you know, the night's still young.",
        "Reese: I know. I was a little hard on you before. I said some things I regret. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Since I'm not such a bad guy after all, maybe --",
        "Reese: Jack!",
        "Jack: No, seriously, ok. Let's just forget about this whole stupid fight over this ring. What do you say?",
        "Reese: You're sweet. Let's just concentrate on Ricky right now, ok? Ok.",
        "Jack: Ricky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Oh! Smooth! Now we can have some real fun, babe.",
        "Ricky: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Casey laughs]",
        "Ricky: You better hold on tight. God, Casey, I've really missed you.",
        "Casey: Oh, me, too.",
        "Ricky: I don't know what I'd do without you. I tell you what -- life would really be dull. So I'm hoping you're here to stay.",
        "Casey: Ricky, shut up and drive.",
        "[Ricky laughs]",
        "Casey: Let's do this!",
        "Ricky: All right, let's do it. Yeah.",

        "Livvie: This wouldn't just be hard on me if you said goodbye.",
        "Caleb: I know that. But I also just can't sit around and let you destroy us.",
        "Livvie: Then help me be the woman you've always wanted.",
        "Caleb: We tried that already, and look what happened.",
        "Livvie: I know. Tess. But look, if you could just make it different somehow.",
        "Caleb: No, this time no magic. This time it has to come from inside you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you're right. You're right. I have to prove to you how much I love you, and I will. I will, Caleb, I swear.",
        "Caleb: We'll see. We'll see.",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to let Alison get to me anymore.",
        "Caleb: Come here.",
        "Livvie: No, no, no, no, no. I have to do something. Ok? For us. I love you. It's for us. I'll be back.",

        "Lucy: Is there any change at all?",
        "Ian: The swelling's down, but there's still no movement on the left side. So, I guess he's coming home with us.",
        "Alison: I will do anything, and I mean anything, if you just leave town. Now, I just need to know what you want me to do."
