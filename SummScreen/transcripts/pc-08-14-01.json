        "Chris: Oh, I've been working on a little something to knock the vampire right \r\nout of you. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm not your guinea pig. ",
        "Chris: Oh, too late. You've already volunteered. Ready for the first trial?\r\n",
        "Gabriela: So this is how you get your women, huh, Chris? ",
        "Chris: Hmm, just the blood-sucking ones. ",

        "Ian: I think Michael can find his own way out of town. ",
        "Michael: Actually, if you could stand me being in Port Charles just a little \r\nwhile longer, I'd like to tell Kevin and Lucy that Caleb's gone, that his \r\ndaughter's safe. ",
        "Eve: Well, Kevin and Lucy are gone, but I know that Jack and Livvie are \r\nstaying at Kevin's place. ",
        "Michael: They should know, too. Can you tell me where that is? ",
        "Ian: We'll tell them, all right? ",
        "Michael: I think it would be better if they heard it from me, Ian. ",
        "Eve: Ok, how about if we all go? ",
        "Ian: Fine. ",
        "Michael: Fine. ",
        "Eve: All right, you two. That's enough. Caleb is dead. Isn't that all that \r\nreally matters? ",

        "Livvie: No, stay back. Get back! ",
        "Jack: Ok. Ok. ",
        "Livvie: All my life, I've had this fear inside. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, please. ",
        "Livvie: And you helped me forget that for a while. But then you pushed me \r\naway. ",
        "Jack: It's only because I didn't want to put you in any danger. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb will make sure that I never hurt again. ",
        "Jack: No. Livvie, no. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb will take the pain away. ",

        "Livvie: Oh. Jack, how -- how did you get me here? Can you fly? ",
        "Jack: I don't know. I just knew I couldn't let you get hurt. ",
        "Livvie: God, see? What you are is incredible. Can you blame me for wanting \r\nto taste all of that power? ",
        "Jack: Livvie, you really want to know? Huh? You really want to know what it's \r\nlike? You're hungry all of the time, except it's not for food. It's for blood, \r\nfor flesh, for something you can't even stomach. And you have to fight with all \r\nyour might to push it away because it's like this darkness that's come over you. \r\nAnd every day it gets harder. Every day you lose a little bit more of yourself. \r\nThat's what Caleb's offering you -- a living hell. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, but I can't -- I can't get his voice out of my head. It's like \r\nhe's always calling for me. I -- ",
        "Jack: Livvie, you have to. You have to fight. The only thing that's real is \r\nmy love for you. That's how I saved you. ",

        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Jamal: What did you do to her? ",
        "Chris: Trying to cure her, Jamal. Or did you forget why I'm wasting years and \r\nyears of medical school on a vampire? ",
        "Alison: Well, Chris, she looks really out of it. ",
        "Jamal: What did you shoot her up with? ",
        "Chris: Oh, very medical, technical. You wouldn't understand. ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: Well, why don't you give me the 411 anyway. ",
        "Chris: Ok. The 411 is that I'm trying to isolate the foreign substance in her \r\nblood from the normal components in her blood. She just received the first I.V. \r\ndrug trial. ",
        "Jamal: You were only supposed to take her blood, not experiment on her. ",
        "Alison: Look, Chris -- ",
        "Jamal: She's not a science project. ",
        "Alison: You don't know how she's going to react with these new drugs. I mean, \r\nthey could be really dangerous. ",
        "Chris: Well, gee, Dr. Barrington, if I don't try, how will I help her? Or \r\nJack? It's not like I can refer to our massive vampire database at General \r\nHospital. ",

        "Lucy: Oh! Oh, Doc. Ok. You were right, as usual. There's nothing quaint or \r\ncutie pie or charming about cemeteries. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, at least you're ok. ",
        "Lucy: I'm going to have bad dreams. I'm going to have nightmares over being \r\nburied alive for the next millennium, probably. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what happened? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Oh! Oh! Look at that gravestone over there. Look what's on it. Oh.\r\n",
        "[Lucy coughs] ",
        "Kevin: \"Lucia Kovich.\" ",
        "Lucy: \"Lucia Kovich\" -- Lucy Coe. Doc, it was just like I was staring at my \r\nown grave. ",
        "Kevin: Let's just come back in the daytime when we can see and it's a lot \r\nless, you know -- ",

        "Kevin: Down that way. ",
        "Lucy: All right. ",
        "Kevin: Watch your step. ",

        "Kevin: Oh, my gosh. I'm afraid to look. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc, you have to! Look, look right there at the words on that \r\ntombstone. Look. ",
        "Kevin: \"Familia sunt omnia\" -- \"family is all.\" ",
        "Lucy: \"Family is all.\" That's exactly what's written on that necklace that \r\nMichael gave to Eve. ",
        "Kevin: So Michael and Caleb's family are from here, just like yours. Well, \r\nwhat do you know? Neighbors. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, dear. Wait a minute. That means that there really are vampires on \r\nmy Kovich tree. ",
        "Kevin: Let's not jump to conclusions. Let's just come back in the sane light \r\nof morning, and in the meantime, let's get the hell out of here. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",

        "Jamal: Do something, Chris! Help her! ",
        "Chris: No, no. Give it a minute. It's part of the process. See? See? She's \r\nfine. ",
        "Jamal: She is suffering. What kind of a doctor are you? ",
        "Alison: Look, whatever you gave her is making her very sick. Why can't you \r\nsee that? ",
        "Chris: I'm the professional here. I know what I'm doing. ",
        "Jamal: Like hell you do. I'm going in. ",
        "Chris: Are you crazy? You want an instant replay of what happened between \r\nJack and me? I turned that juice off, went in there, and he tried to have me for \r\nlunch. ",
        "Jamal: Well, that's tough because I'm making sure this is one patient you \r\ndon't lose. ",
        "Chris: Jamal, she could be faking. You go in there, she'll tear you to \r\nshreds. ",
        "Jamal: There's no way I'm letting you play witch doctor on my sister. ",
        "Chris: And there's no way I'm going to let you undo all my hard work. We \r\ncould be on the brink of a major medical breakthrough. ",
        "Jamal: This is my sister! ",
        "Chris: No, this was your sister! Now she has fangs and you are nothing more \r\nthan a snack! ",
        "Jamal: I thought you were going to help her! ",
        "Chris: I'm trying to help her, Jamal, but this is the real world, and in the \r\nreal world, sometimes we have to make sacrifices in order to make progress. ",
        "Jamal: Forget progress! Chris, you're all selfed up, you're seeing Gabby as \r\nyour claim to fame when she could be in there dying! ",

        "Kevin: Only once you wash the cemetery off. ",
        "Lucy: Very funny. ",
        "Kevin: I'm going to call down and see if there's messages. ",
        "Lucy: Good idea. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, hi. It's Dr. Collins. Any messages for me? What? Would you -- no, \r\nwould you repeat that back for me? Because I'm hard of hearing, that's why. I \r\nwant to hear exactly what the message said. You're sure? Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: What? What? Doc, what -- what is it? It's not Livvie, is it? ",
        "Kevin: Eve left a message. Livvie -- Livvie is fine, and she's going to stay \r\nthat way because Caleb is dead. ",
        "Lucy: What? How did -- how did that happen? ",
        "Kevin: Well, she didn't leave any details, but, Lucy, Livvie's safe. Caleb \r\ncan't hurt her anymore. Lucy, I -- I'm sorry. I want to go back. I want to see \r\nLivvie right now. Your eyebrow's doing that thing. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not. No. No, no, no, no. It's not, it's nothing. ",
        "Kevin: The eyebrow never lies, Lucy. What is it? ",

        "Kevin: You mean about the connection between Caleb and your family? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, this is it. This is my chance. If we go now, I'll be haunted with \r\nit forever. ",
