        "Chris: There's an empty room down this hall. ",
        "Nurse: Dr. Ramsey, should I call down to ER? ",
        "Chris: No, I'm handling it. ",
        "Nurse: I just thought -- ",
        "Chris: Don't think! Just get out of the way. ",
        "Karen: Hey, what's going on? ",
        "Chris: Just stick to your rounds. ",
        "Karen: Learn a few manners, Ramsey. What happened? ",
        "Frank: They know about Gabby. They had her caged up so Ramsey could do some \r\nexperiments on her. ",
        "Karen: My God, Chris, what have you done to her? ",
        "Chris: Karen, what do you think you're doing? ",

        "Jack: Look, Livvie, listen -- ",
        "Livvie: No, get off. ",
        "Jack: Caleb had to be stopped. He was going to take Eve's baby and he would \r\nhave hurt you, too. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, he never would have hurt me! You don't know him. None of \r\nyou knew him, not like I did. ",
        "Michael: He was my brother. I knew him. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and you killed him. You killed him. ",

        "Eve: It's Karen. ",
        "Ian: It's an emergency at G.H. I'll get the car. ",
        "Jack: You guys go ahead. We'll be fine. ",
        "Michael: I won't leave town without saying goodbye. ",

        "Michael: I'm sorry. I'll leave you alone. ",
        "Jack: No, wait. Now that Caleb's gone, what happens to me? ",
        "",
        "Karen: What did you give her? ",
        "Chris: Mixture of demutase and protinic acid. Should have just isolated the \r\nforeign substance in her blood. ",
        "Karen: Well, obviously, it did a lot more than that. What were you thinking?\r\n",
        "Alison: We thought that maybe Chris could help her, like, find a cure or \r\nsomething. We didn't know -- ",
        "Chris: If you want to have a conscience about this, fine, but do it another \r\ntime. I injected a protein binder to counteract the compound. It -- I don't \r\nknow. There's no reason it shouldn't be working. ",
        "Karen: Except she's not your average, everyday patient, Chris. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, no kidding. ",
        "Karen: Ok, let's start another line and call the blood bank for at least two \r\nmore units of blood. ",
        "Chris: It's already done. It's on its way. Frank? ",
        "Karen: Ok. ",
        "Chris: Help me with the restraints. ",
        "Karen: Why don't you guys wait outside. We'll talk about this later. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Please help her. ",
        "Karen: Yeah. Ok, let's get another H and H started after we finish this unit \r\nand make sure her hemoglobin's over six. We want to keep a close eye on that. We \r\ndon't want her breaking out of those. ",
        "Chris: So how long have you known about our little vampire epidemic? ",
        "Karen: Long enough. Why, wondering if I've done any experiments? ",
        "Chris: Don't tell me you're not curious. ",
        "Karen: Being curious and conducting lab experiments on a human being are two \r\ndifferent things. ",
        "Chris: Except she's not exactly human, now, is she? ",
        "Frank: I ought to choke you, Ramsey. ",
        "Karen: Take it easy, Frank. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal, I'm sure that everything's going to be ok, all right?\r\n",
        "Jamal: You don't know that. We don't know anything. Damn it, how could I have \r\nbeen so stupid? ",
        "Alison: You were just trying to keep us safe, everybody safe, including \r\nGabby. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, right, right, by handing her over to Chris Ramsey. That's real \r\nsafe. After everything he did to Jack, I should have known. ",
        "Alison: We didn't know what else to do. ",
        "Eve: They're in here? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: How is she? ",
        "Chris: Does everybody know about the vampires? ",
        "Eve: We know enough. What have you got her on, Karen? ",
        "Karen: A blood transfusion and a session of plasma pharesis to hopefully get \r\nthe drugs out of her system. All we can do now is wait. ",
        "Frank: I've got security in Emilio's room. I think we should do the same \r\nhere. ",
        "Ian: Let me come with you. Give me a second, ok? ",
        "Eve: Ok. How could you do this? How could you just play with somebody's life \r\nlike that? ",
        "Chris: I was trying to help. I screwed up, ok? I thought I had things under \r\ncontrol. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but you didn't. ",
        "Karen: Gabby's BP's up and her vitals are returning to normal. ",
        "Eve: She's coming out of it. ",
        "Chris: Gabby? ",
        "Gabriela: What happened? ",
        "Karen: You're going to be all right, Gabby. You had a close call. ",
        "Chris: We almost lost you. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, maybe you should have. ",
        "",
        "Michael: I'm not sure I have the answers you're looking for, Jack. ",
        "Jack: I know you're not like your brother, but you were the closest person to \r\nhim. You knew exactly what he went through. ",
        "Michael: Caleb was cursed with the life he was given. And I thought I could \r\nhelp him with that. ",
        "Jack: How? Because he made me what I am now, and I'm afraid of what I might \r\ndo to Livvie. ",
        "Michael: I understand. ",
        "Jack: She wanted me to feed on her. She wanted me to make her what I am. And \r\nI was scared to death that I'm going to lose control, that I'm going to let \r\nmyself hurt her, and I can't. Please help me. You have to tell me how you \r\ncontrolled Caleb. I mean, didn't you say that there was a time when you could \r\nreach him and you could stop him? ",
        "Michael: There was. ",
        "Jack: Well, when? I mean, how did you do it? ",
        "Michael: After Olivia -- the first Olivia -- had died, Caleb came to me. He \r\nwas so devastated that he had killed the woman he loved. He begged me to help \r\nhim. He wanted help. ",
        "Jack: So he was able to control his urges. I mean, he wasn't dangerous, \r\nright? ",
        "Michael: For a long time he wasn't. He was willing to live with me in \r\nseclusion at the monastery. He didn't want to be what he was. ",
        "Jack: Then what changed? ",
        "Michael: He saw Livvie. ",
        "Michael: He went out one night and he saw her and it started all over again.\r\n",
        "Jack: That's what I was afraid of. I love Livvie more than anything, and when \r\nwe're together, my senses, my urges are stronger than ever. ",
        "Michael: You're afraid. You're afraid in time you'll hurt her, that you'll \r\ntry to turn her. ",
        "Jack: And I can't let that happen. Father, please, tell me there's something \r\nelse I can do. ",
        "Michael: I wish I had the answer, Jack. I looked forever with Caleb. Every \r\ntime he tried to stop, even when he was locked up, those impulses -- they came \r\nback. They never completely went away. ",

        "Kevin: No, I didn't. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",

        "Lucy: Ooh, thanks. ",
        "Kevin: How do you feel? ",
        "Lucy: Mmm, mmm. I'm ok. I guess as ok as someone can be knowing someone just \r\ntried to kill them. ",
        "Kevin: Do you remember what happened? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I came out of the shower and I smelled gas and I heard the heater \r\nhissing, so I ran over to try and turn it off and, Doc, the handle came right \r\noff in my hand -- almost like it was deliberate. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I know, I saw the heater. And I ran into some guy in the hallway \r\nwho was obviously sent to stall me. But lucky for you, whoever tried to do this \r\nmissed. We're leaving here tonight. I've got us booked on a flight that leaves \r\nin an hour. ",
        "Lucy: No! Doc, no, wait. ",
        "Kevin: Caleb is dead, Lucy. There's no life-or-death reason to stay, but \r\nthere is one to leave -- your life, and I'm not going to risk it. ",
        "Lucy: But that's exactly why I have to stay. This is my life. This is my \r\nentire ancestry, where I come from. Now, I'm a threat to somebody. They want me \r\nout of the way. I need to find out who wants me out of the way. ",
        "Kevin: It's too dangerous, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: It's more dangerous if I don't find out. I would never, ever feel safe \r\nanywhere. You know that. ",
        "Kevin: Look -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc, please, someone just tried to gas me. They need to know they're \r\nmessing with the wrong woman. ",

        "Karen: Well, she's fine and recovering, if that's what you're wondering. ",
        "Eve: But she still has a long way to go. ",
        "Chris: Well, if this is about another third degree, I'm in no mood. ",
        "Ian: Whatever this is, I need to talk to you about something. ",
        "Chris: And that would be? ",
        "Karen: Technically, Gabby's recovering just fine and getting enough strength \r\nback to be safe. ",
        "Frank: Here. But there's no way we can release her and have her out on the \r\nstreets. ",
        "Chris: All right. Then you understand what I was trying to do. ",
        "Ian: We understand you're trying to make a buck off of this. ",
        "Chris: Who said that's what I was doing? ",
        "Ian: If your tests showed anything that would help Gabby or the others, we \r\nneed to know about it. ",
        "Eve: Did they, Chris? Did you find anything? ",
        "Chris: I didn't finish. There's still a lot of tests that need to be run. ",
        "Ian: All right, but we got to keep working on this antidote. ",
        "Karen: He's right. It's the only way to save Gabby, Jack -- ",
        "Frank: Emilio -- ",
        "Ian: And anyone else whose life is in danger. ",

        "Michael: I'm sorry for what my brother has done to you. And I'm sorry if I'm \r\nnot offering you much hope right now. ",
        "Jack: All that matters is Livvie. But -- but maybe if I left Port Charles, \r\nyou know, I mean, maybe if I left she would be safe as long as I didn't come \r\nback. I mean, maybe that would be a good idea, for me to leave. I mean, what do \r\nyou think? ",
        "Michael: I know you're looking for someone to tell you what to do, Jack, to \r\ngive you certainty, but all the answers are inside. All I can do is tell you \r\nwhat this life was like for Caleb. ",
        "Jack: I don't want to be like your brother. ",
        "Michael: I understand. I can't condone the pain he caused people, but Caleb \r\n-- he wasn't pure evil. He struggled with what was inside him just like you are. \r\nBut all he wanted was a normal life, to love and have a family like everyone \r\nelse. ",
        "Jack: But he couldn't. ",
        "Michael: No, he couldn't. But his desire for it became too much. Eventually, \r\nhe gave in to that, to all the desires. ",
        "Jack: And that's when he became the monster I saw. ",
        "Michael: Yes. ",
        "Jack: Well -- ",
        "Michael: I can see how much you love Livvie and how valiantly you're fighting \r\nwhat's inside you. You can be strong. Search your soul for a way to avoid the \r\nsame fate as my brother. ",

        "",
        "Ian: If we're going to be working on this together, we have to keep it under \r\nwraps. ",
        "Chris: That's easy. We'll just keep Gabby and Emilio under tight security. \r\nI'll whip up some kind of phony plague to keep them quarantined. ",
        "Karen: I never thought I'd say this, but good idea. ",
        "Chris: Thank you. ",
        "Ian: No one goes into their rooms but us, all right? ",

        "Chris: We just lie. ",

        "Michael: I wish there was more I could do. ",
        "Jack: Right now I'm the only person who can help myself. Thanks. Promise me \r\none thing. Watch over Livvie. Pray for her. ",
