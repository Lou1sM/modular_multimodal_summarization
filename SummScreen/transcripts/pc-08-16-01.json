        "Lucy: All right, I think that should be everything. I've got my tarot cards, \r\nincense, I've got my runes. Oh, yeah, I've got my collapsible stake. ",
        "Kevin: Where did you get a collapsible stake? ",
        "Lucy: Don't ask. All right, wait, my incantation book. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, \r\nthere it is, and my crystals. Ok, I'm all set. Oh, an umbrella. It could rain.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, we are not trotting off to some stranger's house at night in the \r\nmiddle of vampire country. ",
        "Lucy: This is not some stranger's house, this is my family, and it would be \r\nvery, very rude to ignore the invitation. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, and exactly how do you know that they are family? I mean, this \r\nnote wasn't even signed. ",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, this note had this seal on it. Now, this is the same symbol I \r\nsaw on that necklace that Michael gave Eve, not to mention these words -- \"I \r\nthink it's time we finally meet.\" ",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh, not to mention we have no proof that you're even related to \r\nthe Morleys. ",
        "Lucy: But we do not have any proof I'm not. ",
        "Kevin: Has it occurred to you that this could be a trick, Lucy? That the same \r\nperson who sent that note might be the same person who just tried to kill you?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but it also occurred to me that the note could've been sent by \r\nthat mysterious wonderful person who saved my life in the nick of time. I hate \r\nit when you get so darn logical. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, then you agree this is ludicrous and dangerous. ",
        "Lucy: What I agree on is, yes, maybe it is, but I have this. I have my bag of \r\nprotection. If I sense any evil in or around that house, I'll be ready. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, no. We're getting on a plane and we're leaving Transylvania \r\ntonight. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. I know you're trying to protect me, and I love you so very \r\nmuch for that, but please, Doc, I have to do this. This is my one chance to have \r\nall the questions about who I am and where I come from answered. I have to go \r\nthrough with it. Now, if you want to leave and go back to Livvie, I can \r\nunderstand that. I'm fine with that. ",
        "Kevin: That's a low blow, Lucy. You know I'd never do that. ",
        "Lucy: I know, and I love you for it and thanks for understanding. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: What are you going to do to me? ",
        "Michael: I'm not going to hurt you. Please don't be afraid. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you can't make me hate him. ",
        "Michael: I can try. ",
        "Livvie: No, Caleb loved me. And now he's gone and my life is over. ",
        "Michael: This is just the beginning. You must realize that, Livvie. Throwing \r\nyour whole life away over Caleb is a waste. ",
        "Livvie: No, I don't have to listen to this. I'm sick of everyone trying to \r\npoison me against him, and I'm definitely not listening to the person who killed \r\nhim. ",
        "Michael: Killing my brother saved your life, so yes, you will listen to me.\r\n",

        "Jack: Oh, man, I was afraid you wouldn't show. ",
        "Jamal: You're crazy, you know that? This is whacked. ",
        "Jack: Jamal, if you're not going to help me, then you can just take off. ",
        "Jamal: That's exactly why I'm here. ",
        "Jack: Well, let's do it. End all this, just like we talked about. ",
        "Jamal: You make it sound just so simple. ",
        "Jack: It is simple. If Livvie's going to be safe, I have to die. ",

        "Karen: Alan is going to be here any minute. We've got to come up with \r\nsomething to tell him ",
        "Ian: We don't even know if he suspects anything. ",
        "Karen: Oh, trust me, when he said he wanted to see us, he did not sound \r\nhappy.",
        "Chris: All right, that's it. I for one am not going to stick around and find \r\nout bug Alan Quartermaine does or doesn't have up his -- hello, sir. ",

        "Chris: Yes, sir. ",

        "Karen: Uh, no, actually, no. ",
        "Frank: No, not a clue. ",
        "Ian: That's funny, we were just discussing -- ",
        "Alan: I just came from room 607. ",
        "Frank: 607. Gabby's room? ",
        "Alan: Yeah, Gabby's room. And there I found a security guard on the door with \r\nstrict orders from you all that no one goes in or comes out. That includes \r\nnurses, doctors, and the chief of staff. Now, what makes it even stranger is \r\nthat Gabby's name does not appear on the admittance record nor does she have any \r\nhistory of health problems. So needless to say, I need an explanation. Somebody \r\nbetter start talking and it damn well better be good. ",
        "Eve: Well, actually, it's true, Gabby was admitted, um, unofficially, but \r\nit's just that -- ",
        "Alan: Just that what? ",
        "Eve: Well, we -- we, uh -- it happened so fast that we -- ",
        "Ian: I'm not going to lie to you, Alan. You've been a good friend to me and \r\nI'm going to tell you the truth. And I need you to trust me, trust us. It's not \r\ngoing to be easy. ",

        "Livvie: Let go of me. You are a murder. ",
        "Michael: I don't care what you think of me, but you will know the truth about \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Livvie: No, there's nothing that you can say that'll change anything. I loved \r\nhim and I always will. ",
        "Michael: You didn't even know him. ",
        "Livvie: No, I knew everything. But all that mattered is that he was a \r\nwonderful man who offered me the most incredible life, eternal life and eternal \r\nlove. He told me that I'd never -- ",
        "Michael: Never want for anything? That you were the family that could never \r\nbe broken? Never feel helpless or lost or hurt again? ",
        "Livvie: How did you know that? ",
        "Michael: Because it's the same thing he told to Olivia. You remember her? The \r\nwoman he loved before you? The woman he never stopped loving? Not since the day \r\nhe took her life. ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Michael: Don't you see, Livvie, that your dreams are just Caleb's dreams, and \r\nthose are dreams he shared with another? ",
        "Livvie: No, that's not true. ",
        "Michael: No? Then tell me, when was the last time you thought for yourself or \r\nyou felt an emotion or a desire that wasn't put there by Caleb's voice in your \r\nhead? He controlled you, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Michael: He manipulated you. ",
        "Livvie: No. No, you're lying. He wouldn't do that to me. ",
        "Michael: You were just a substitution, a replacement for the love he had \r\nbefore and lost. ",
        "Livvie: No. I was his love. It was me. ",
        "Michael: It was never you, Livvie. Caleb told me himself. You were just there \r\nto fill a void left by someone you so resemble and right the wrong of what he \r\nhad done to her, as if that was somehow possible. ",
        "Livvie: God. I don't believe this. ",
        "Michael: You were lied to and used by a man who thought nothing of destroying \r\nyour life. But it's not too late, Livvie. You have to get rid of Caleb. You have \r\nto expel him from your heart and your mind and reclaim the life that he has \r\ntaken from you. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God. What have I done? ",

        "Jamal: I am not driving a stake through your heart. ",
        "Jack: I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Livvie's life's in danger as long \r\nas I'm alive. ",
        "Jamal: Jack, listen to me -- ok, we're trying to find a way to help you. Ok, \r\nEve, Ian, and the rest of them -- they're working around the clock on this \r\nthing, bro. ",
        "Jack: Well, they're wasting their time. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, don't give me that. My sister almost died from this. Ok? They will \r\nfind an answer. ",
        "Jack: Oh, and then what, huh? What if they do find an answer and I become \r\nnormal again? How do you know I'm going to stay that way? Huh, Jamal? How do you \r\nknow that someday I'm not going to see Livvie and I'm not going to get these \r\nsame hunger pains that go on inside of me? How do you know that? ",
        "Jamal: You don't know. You just have to believe and trust. ",
        "Jack: Well, that's not good enough. There's only one way to keep Livvie safe, \r\nand we both know what that is. ",
        "Jamal: Sorry. I'm not buying it. ",
        "Jack: What about Caleb? His own brother couldn't even control him. ",
        "Jamal: Caleb? Caleb? Caleb was a monster. ",
        "Jack: A monster's what he became. Jamal, it wasn't the kind of life he \r\nwanted. ",
        "Jamal: What, so, what, you're defending him now? ",
        "Jack: Listen to me -- it's what Michael told me. Caleb tried to fight it, he \r\ntried to fight it hard, but the urge was too strong. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, man, that's not going to happen to you, Jack. ",
        "Jack: No, wake up, man! Reality is that if I live, I'm going to become what \r\nhe is! And -- no. That's not going to happen, Jamal. Not if you care about me \r\nand not if you care about Livvie.",

        "Jamal: But I will stand by you, all right? Look, I'm going to help you do \r\nthis, all right, but you got to help me, too. You know, you got to keep hanging \r\nin there and not give up, all right? And you know what's got you so stressed, \r\nright, is you're hungry. I mean, you know how you are when you get low on the \r\njuice. I mean, you get week and you lose your fight, but, look, I'm going to fix \r\nyou all up, I'm going to take care of you, get you back to yourself in no time.\r\n",

        "Livvie: But he made the world sound so wonderful, so amazing. ",
        "Michael: While all the while knowing the truth -- that it is a cursed and \r\nmiserable existence. You must see that, knowing how desperate and unhappy he \r\ntruly was. I understand you wanting to believe in him. Anyone would've been \r\ntempted. And temptation is a powerful thing. I've felt it myself. But the reason \r\nI'm here and Caleb isn't is because I stayed strong and I resisted, and you are \r\nstrong, too. Look at me. You just need to keep telling yourself -- telling \r\nyourself that you are better off without him, that you are better off with the \r\nfriends and family that God has given to you. Promise me you'll hang on to this \r\nand hang on to the dreams that you had before Caleb. You do remember, don't you, \r\nLivvie? You remember what you wanted before Caleb? ",
