        "Karen: When Alan found out that we were doing research on vampires, I thought \r\nour careers were over. ",
        "Frank: I thought he was going to call the police. ",
        "Ian: That's what you call dodging the silver bullets. ",
        "Karen: Ha-ha, not funny. ",
        "Ian: No, it's vampire humor. You can laugh at that. Eve, you all right? Want \r\na drink? ",
        "Eve: Ah. ",
        "Ian: You ok? ",
        "Eve: I'm ok. Our baby is safe. It's over. ",
        "Ian: That it is. That it is. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: How dare you sneak up on two strangers like that and scare me half to \r\ndeath. ",
        "Man: Well, I would hardly call two honored guests that I've invited into my \r\nhome strangers. But I do apologize for startling you. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if you're serious about the apology, you can begin by explaining \r\nwhy the invitation, who the heck you are, and why all the mystery. ",
        "Man: Of course, Dr. Collins. And do forgive the cloak and dagger, but there \r\nwas no sense offering safe haven if the entire village knows you're here. ",
        "Lucy:  Safe haven? ",
        "Man: I am aware of the attempt that was made on your life, Ms. Coe. ",
        "Kevin: Well, then you can understand why we're less than open-hearted about \r\nthe invitation. Come on, Lucy. ",
        "Man: Please, Dr. Collins. Please reconsider leaving quite so soon. But the \r\nchances are if you leave this house now, it's unlikely you'll ever arrive home.\r\n",
        "",
        "Alison: I've been waiting for you to call. What's going on? ",
        "Jamal: Nothing to report yet. ",
        "Alison: Nothing at all? ",
        "Jamal: Nope. All's quiet upstairs in Jack and Livvie land. ",
        "Livvie: Just because it's quiet doesn't mean there isn't anything to report.\r\n",
        "Alison: Livvie, hi. Where's Jack? ",
        "Livvie: He's gone. ",
        "Alison: He's -- he's gone? What do you mean he's gone? ",
        "Livvie: I mean he left. It's all over. Jack said goodbye. ",
        "Alison: Wait, I don't -- I don't get it. ",
        "Livvie: He's leaving. That's what he told me. ",
        "Alison: Well, I mean, are you sure that he said that -- ",
        "Livvie: I'm not sure of anything anymore, ok? I'm just telling you what he \r\ntold me. Oh, God, I got to get out of here. I need some air. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie, I don't think that's a good idea. ",
        "Livvie: You know, Jamal, I don't give a damn if it is or if it isn't. Jack's \r\ngone and Caleb's gone, and now what? ",
        "Alison: Livvie, you're safe. ",
        "Livvie: For something I have wanted my whole life -- being safe? -- this \r\nfeels awfully empty. ",
        "Jamal: He's gone. ",
        "Alison: You don't exactly seem very surprised about this. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, not exactly. ",
        "Alison: Why? Where's Jack? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I don't know, but I don't have a very good feeling about this, \r\nAli. ",
        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Jamal: Because he asked me to end it for him, ok? ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jamal: No, I said no, but now I'm thinking he might have decided to take care \r\nof it himself. ",
        "Alison: Take care of what? ",
        "Jamal: I think Jack went somewhere to die. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Ok. Ok, Jack. It's going to be worth it. Just keep telling yourself \r\nthat. It's going to be worth it in the end. You have to see it through. Ah. Ah. You have to see it through for Livvie. Ok? Oh. Livvie, I love you so \r\nmuch. But now -- now you're going to be safe. At least I'll die knowing -- I'll \r\ndie knowing I can't hurt you. ",
        "",
        "Man: Well, that concludes the tour. As you can see, there's more than enough \r\nroom to accommodate you if you decide to accept my invitation. ",
        "Kevin: Can we get back to the part about who's trying to kill us, please? ",
        "Man: No disrespect, doctor, but it is Ms. Coe who poses the threat. ",
        "Kevin: In what way? ",
        "Man: These people are deeply superstitious and they have managed somehow to \r\nhold on to many of the old ways. Now, normally, this is a quaint and picturesque \r\npractice. But unfortunately, because of Ms. Coe's presence, they seem to feel \r\nthat she has put them in some sort of mortal danger, even, and they've chosen to \r\nreact accordingly. ",
        "Lucy: By trying to kill me? ",
        "Man: Well, they're really just children. But in ignorant groups, even \r\nchildren can be quite troublesome. Over the years, I've taken it upon myself to \r\nkeep an eye on them. ",
        "Lucy: I see. So you saved my life? ",
        "Man: Eternally at your service. ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute, why would these people see Lucy as a threat? ",
        "Man: You know the answer to that, don't you, my dear? ",
        "Lucy: Because they know I'm related to Caleb. Somehow they sense that I'm \r\npart of that family. ",
        "Man: Your intuitive powers are quite impressive. That is indeed what the \r\nrabble fear and indeed what the rabble do best. ",
        "Kevin: Are the rabble as evasive about their names as you are? ",
        "Man: Oh, not at all, my good doctor, no, although even in this part of the \r\nworld, we do believe that knowing even a person's name can open the door to a \r\nwielding of power both for and against the individual. We like to share names \r\nhere as the first sign of trust between new friends. ",
        "Kevin: And your name is? ",
        "Man: James Richfield. I'm the Morley family retainer. Oh, there's another \r\nold custom. Yes, my people have looked after the Morley family concerns for, \r\nwell, centuries. ",
        "Lucy: Well, that's great. Then you could tell me everything you know about \r\nthe family, maybe the family secrets. ",
        "James: I'm on intimate terms with every skeletal detail, I'm afraid. ",
        "Lucy: Then you know what Caleb is. ",
        "James: Ah. As do you, I suppose. ",
        "Kevin: We are talking about the fact that Caleb is a vampire, aren't we? ",
        "James: As the family retainer, I prefer to talk about master Caleb's \r\naffliction with a certain delicacy. ",
        "Kevin: Well, of course. He sucks blood, he kills innocent people. He's also \r\nafter my daughter. ",
        "James: Master Caleb was banished from this house many years ago, and yes, \r\ndoctor, yes, he's the reason these villagers live in fear. Sadly, your arrival \r\nhas -- has opened many old wounds, revived many bad memories, and that's why I \r\nurge you, please accept my hospitality. Stay for tonight at least. I can arrange \r\nsafe passage for both of you in the morning. ",
        "Lucy: That's not a bad idea. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, maybe the worst possible one, too. ",
        "Lucy: But I came to get answers on my connection to the family and if he can \r\ntell -- ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute, mister -- let me ask you something, mister -- ",
        "James: James. James, doctor. And yes, gladly. I'll tell you anything that \r\ndoes not violate a confidence. ",
        "Kevin: You barely reacted when Lucy mentioned that Caleb was a vampire. ",
        "James: Well, it was hardly surprising. ",
        "Kevin: Just business as usual? ",
        "James: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Kevin: Didn't skip a beat hearing Caleb's name after all these years, out of \r\nthe blue, from two strangers? ",
        "James: What is your point, doctor? ",
        "Kevin: My point is I don't believe you would react so casually had Caleb left \r\nmany, many years ago. In fact, I believe he left here not too long ago at all. \r\nAnd I believe there's something you're not telling us. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Anything? ",
        "Alison: No, nothing. No sign of Jack anywhere. ",
        "Jamal: I should've known. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, I don't understand any of this. He went through so much to \r\nsave Livvie. Why would he want to die now? ",
        "Jamal: With Caleb gone, he thinks he's the only threat left to her. ",
        "Alison: But how is he going to do it? ",
        "Jamal: He knows that he needs blood to keep going, right? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: So if he decides to stop feeding -- ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Look, without any more blood, he might be able to last a few more \r\nhours, then it'd be over. ",
        "Alison: Well, we have to find him! ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, but if we do, how do we make him do something that he \r\ndoesn't want to do? ",
        "Alison: All right, think, think, think, think, think. We have to put \r\nourselves in his shoes. Ok, if I was going to die and I knew that it wasn't \r\ngoing to be very pretty, where would I look, where would I hide? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, if it was me, I'd probably crawl under a rock. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, Jamal, that's it. Jack thinks that he's a monster just like \r\nCaleb, right? ",
        "Jamal: Right. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so then he would go to where Caleb would go. ",
        "Jamal: Right, and the only place that Caleb has been -- ",
        "Alison: Lately is the catacombs. ",
        "Jamal: Is the catacombs. ",
        "Alison: Come on, let's go. ",

        "Jack: Livvie, remember me. Oh. It's almost -- almost over. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Oh, Jack. Well, here I am, at our place, where we first met, where -- \r\nwhere you taught me not to be afraid. Where I was so happy just loving you, \r\nfeeling all those things that -- for the first time in your arms. God, all that \r\njoy. I'm so sorry I pushed you away. I'm sorry I couldn't love you the way you \r\nwanted me to before it all fell apart, but when you died on that bike, Jack, a \r\npart of us died, too, and no matter how hard we tried, we just couldn't get it \r\nback. Maybe you were right to just walk away. Maybe it was the only thing that \r\ncould make us move forward in our lives. But it just -- oh, it hurts so much, \r\nJack. I come here every time my heart gets broken, every time I've lost you. \r\nOnly this time I don't have a heart to break. All the heart I had is gone, and \r\nthere's nothing left. You gave me my heart, Jack, and tonight it's gone forever \r\nwith you. ",
        "",
        "Jack: You were my life, Livvie. Everything. And now I have to let you go to \r\nsave you. My love, goodbye. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Goodbye, Jack. ",
        "",
        "James: I don't blame you for being wary, doctor. I imagine were I in your \r\nplace, I'd feel the same way. ",
        "Kevin: So if we insist on leaving? ",
        "James: Your lives are yours to risk. You're not prisoners. However -- and \r\nthis may explain my lack of a suitable reaction response to the word \"vampire\" \r\n-- I -- I beg you to remember that in this part of the world, though uncommon, \r\nsuch creatures are very real. ",
        "Lucy: I thought Caleb was the last. ",
        "James: \"Was,\" did you say? Did you say \"was?\" ",
        "Kevin: Well, we certainly didn't want to be the bearer of bad news, but yes. \r\nYour master Caleb is dead. ",
        "James: Oh. I wasn't aware. Do you by any chance know how or who? ",
        "Lucy: It was Michael. Caleb's brother Michael. Michael destroyed Caleb. ",
        "James: Master Caleb's brother, Michael. That must have been an \r\nextraordinarily difficult thing for Michael to do. They were very close once \r\nupon a time. ",
        "Kevin: Twins usually are. ",
        "James: Generally. Well, I think we can both agree on one thing, doctor -- \r\nthat this life is full of the most unexpected surprises. If you'll be so kind as \r\nto excuse me, I have important business that I must tend to, given these new \r\ncircumstances. ",
        "Kevin: Well, we may not still be here once your business is finished. ",
        "James: Choice is yours. Stay or leave. ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Leave. ",
        "Kevin: I'm going to call Victor, see if he can find us a way to get the hell \r\nout of here. ",
        "Lucy: The sooner the better, Doc. ",
