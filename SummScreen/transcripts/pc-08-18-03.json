        "Lucy tries to make Kevin feel at home while staying at her place. When Ian sees her discomfort with being affectionate in her estranged husband's presence, he decides to move back into the loft, but Lucy talks him out of it. Ian goes to the hospital to work on the research, but Chris has other plans. He warns Ian to watch out for Kevin, although Ian is confident that the other man is no threat to his relationship with Lucy. Frustrated by his inability to feed himself, Kevin tearfully asks Lucy why she's doing this. He wants an honest answer as to whether or not she still has feelings for him. Lucy admits that she always will, but things have changed. Promising to help him through this, she takes his hand in hers. Christina comes home from Gail's and rushes to give her daddy a kiss. When she asks him to paint with her, Kevin offers to read her a story instead. Christina gets out the wedding album, and the three of them talk about the wedding day. Ian comes in, sees the family together, and decides to leave again. Jamal expresses reluctance to have Jack trick Olivia after all, which leads Jack to conclude that Jamal thinks he's still in love with his ex-girlfriend. Jack assures Jamal that she is the worst thing that has ever happened to him. Afraid of being found out for biting Imani, Olivia tries to pay her to leave town. She is stunned by the news that Imani isn't a vampire, and she wants to know what she is. Claiming to be just like everyone else, Imani refuses the bribe and kicks her out of her motel room just as Jamal shows up to make her room safer. Imani is touched by his offer to install window locks and other security devices. When Jamal realizes that he forgot to bring a hammer, Imani removes one from under her pillow. Jamal gets something in his eye, and Imani blows on it to make it better. They almost kiss, but they're interrupted by a phone call. Relieved when Jamal leaves without kissing her, Imani is stunned when he returns to do just that. When Olivia shows up at the club in a bad mood, Jack kicks her out but then changes his mind before she gets out the door. Claiming that she's really not such a bad person, he offers to let them be in bad moods together. She believes in his sincerity, but Jack is pleased with himself for getting her to buy into his act."

        "Lucy: I'm having everything sent that you wrote on the list from your home to here, and the housekeeper said that the lighthouse is no problem, she'll keep everything in order, and we're just going to call her with updates, right?",

        "Kevin: Thank you.",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "Ian: Didn't mean that. No one's rushing you.",
        "Kevin: Look, please, don't apologize. I feel like I'm taking over your home.",
        "Lucy: You're not. That's nonsense. We both really -- here -- want you here, we do. Don't we?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: You're welcome.",
        "Ian: I'm going to the hospital.",
        "Lucy: What? Wait a minute. You said you had a couple of hours to --",
        "Ian: No, I better go now.",
        "Lucy: Oh, ok, then, I will -- I'll walk you out.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: I'm going to walk him to the car. Ok? Hey -- I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Ian: Oh, no. It's not easy for any of us. Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm moving back to the loft.",
        "Lucy: You can't. I can't live without you. I can't -- you can't do that. I -- I need you, and you know how much I need you here. I --",
        "Ian: I'm a wee bit uncomfortable with all this.",
        "Lucy: But all I know is that this is your home, because my home is with you and I thought your home was with me. And I know this is uncomfortable and awkward and horrible, but I'm just trying to do the right thing.",
        "Ian: Well, that's just it, isn't it? Sometimes doing the right thing's not as easy as we may think.",
        "Lucy: We're doing this because Christina needs this.",
        "Ian: Christina has what she needs. She doesn't needs me. She needs him.",
        "Lucy: She does need you. But more importantly, I need you. I can't be without you, so, I'm asking you to do this for me, please.",

        "Jamal: Hey, Jack, what's going on, man?",
        "Jack: Hey, what's up, dude? What's going on, man?",
        "Jamal: Nothing, man. I'm chilling. Have you seen Imani?",
        "Jack: No, no, I haven't seen her around. You want me to leave her a message, though?",
        "Jamal: Sure? No, no, damn. No, I thought she would be here. What?",
        "Jack: You got it bad, man. I see a little whiplash --",
        "Jamal: Did someone ever tell you your smart mouth will get your soft behind?",
        "Jack: Oh --",
        "Jamal: Ooh, yeah. And by the way, have you seen Garza, either? He stole my bike.",
        "Jack: Garza -- he's not on my good list. He's probably off naked in the woods with Reese.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Is it really history between you two or what?",
        "Jack: Well, it looks like Reese and I are over. Be careful what you wish for.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, about that, too, about wishing and Caleb and Livvie and that ring and everything -- I wanted to talk to you about that.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it. I'm just, you know, I'm trying to be careful.",
        "Jamal: I was thinking, maybe there's another way to go about that.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about? I mean, last night you and Rafe were all over me trying to get Livvie back into my life. What changed?",
        "Jamal: Nothing. I don't think that we thought it all the way through is all.",
        "Jack: No. No. You still think that I have a thing for Livvie, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I think we need to talk.",
        "Imani: Start talking.",
        "Livvie: I just -- I came by to see how you were feeling after what happened.",
        "Imani: Never better. But that's not really why you're here, is it?",
        "Livvie: Look, I made a mistake. I was a little freaked about something, and I wasn't thinking, and I'm not really supposed to be going around biting people, you know?",
        "Imani: Oh, \"not supposed to\"?",
        "Livvie: I can't afford for anyone to find out what happened. It would just really turn my life upside down, and I don't need that trauma right now. So I'm sorry, but you're probably not going to like this.",
        "Imani: Like what?",
        "Livvie: You need to disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: So the gamma globulin isn't binding the way we thought.",
        "Ian: Ramsey, you got a minute?",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, if it's about the blood substitute, I haven't figured out a way to make you age any normally.",
        "Ian: Ok, all right, I get it. Now let's get to work.",
        "Chris: You know, I was thinking about this. Do you realize that anybody on this planet would kill to have the fountain of youth, but you're the only one who wants to shorten his life?",
        "Ian: I don't want to shorten my life. I want a normal life, a normal lifespan. That's what I want.",
        "Chris: You sure about that? I mean, 200 or 300 years sounds pretty good to me.",
        "Ian: Well, you're welcome to it. What have we got?",
        "Chris: See for yourself. Actually, I got some stuff I need to take care of.",
        "Ian: Some stuff? Like dress-up stuff with the thing.",
        "Chris: Ok, if you must know, yes. Georges has to talk to a bunch of fashion buyers about bidding on his new line of edgy summer fun.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Chris: Why don't we work on the tests tonight?",
        "Ian: No, tonight's no good. It's Kevin's first night at Lucy's home.",
        "Chris: Well, can't blame you there. Got to keep an eye of the fox in your hen house, right?",
        "Ian: He doesn't threaten me.",
        "Chris: Oh, well, that's good. Of course, if you really believe that, you're a bonehead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: All right, right out of my gourmet kitchen, sandwich specialty. Voila!",
        "Kevin: You know, Lucy, you really didn't have to go to all this trouble.",
        "Lucy: I sliced some turkey and I ordered the pasta.",
        "Kevin: Well, it looks wonderful.",
        "Lucy: Well, good. You know, I tried to make it a little more special. I added a few vegetables and some cookies and everything, and -- anyway, there you go. The fork's in the napkin.",
        "Kevin: I need it on my right side.",
        "Lucy: Oh, right. Right, your right side, not the left side. I am so sorry.",
        "Kevin: It's ok, it's ok.",
        "Lucy: No, I got to remember that. I can remember that.",
        "Kevin: Well, it'll take a little time to get used to this, right?",
        "Lucy: Right, changes --",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: But that's ok, you're going to be fine. All right, I tell you what -- here, there you --",
        "Kevin: Oh, no.",
        "Lucy: Ok, wait, I can do this. I tell you what -- why don't I help you, hmm? Here you go. We'll start with the good stuff that we know came from a good place, you know. Here we go. All right, this will be easy. Sorry, I --",
        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Kevin: Why are you doing this, Lucy?",
        "Lucy: You know why I'm doing this. I'm -- I'm doing this for you and for our daughter. I want Christina to know that you're ok, and you are going to be ok.",
        "Kevin: That's not the only answer. You've turned your whole life upside down.",
        "Lucy: Why do you keep asking me that question?",
        "Kevin: Because I want an honest answer, that's why.",
        "Lucy: Do you want me to say that I'm still -- are you asking me to say that the reason I'm doing this is because I still have feelings for you?",
        "Kevin: Yes. That's what I'm asking you. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You still really think that I have a thing for Livvie, don't you?",
        "Jamal: No. All I'm saying is that, you know, maybe Rafe and I shouldn't have talked you into conning your ex-girlfriend. I mean, come on, Jack, you got to remember I had front-row seats for the Jack-and-Livvie-in-love show, all right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, thanks for the confidence, bro. I lived the Jack-gets- dumped-by-Livvie love show, not once, not twice, but three times. I still have reruns going on in my head.",
        "Jamal: I know. Ok, fine --",
        "Jack: No, Livvie was the worst thing that's ever happened to me, Jamal, and that includes being bit by a vampire and crawling out of that damn grave.",
        "Jamal: Ok, are you done?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm done.",
        "Jamal: Ok, fine, fine, go back to what you're doing.",
        "Jack: Fine, fine. Yeah, I got to get back to work.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, me, too, all right? Fine.",
        "Jack: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Jamal: Jack?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Jamal: Let me give you a hug or something? All right, now. I'll see you later, man.",
        "Jack: Get out of here, dude.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: You attack me, and I have to leave?",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to hurt you, ok? And I certainly didn't come empty- handed.",
        "Imani: Oh, you want to pay me?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, take it. All I want is for you to leave Port Charles. I don't care where you go.",
        "Imani: This is pretty impressive. This is what, a couple hundred bucks?",
        "Livvie: Look, if you want more, I can get it for you. In the meantime, I will explain to you whatever questions you want answered about becoming one of us.",
        "Imani: I'm not one of you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, of course you are. I turned you. I bit you myself.",
        "Imani: I'm not a vampire, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Yes, you are a vampire. You're not, are you? But I was -- you -- what are you?",
        "Imani: Whatever it is you think you know, you're wrong. I am just like everybody else. You just got a little mixed up.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but --",
        "Imani: You are mistaken. And as far as our meeting in the alley, that never happened.",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Imani: Oh, no. Say it once more like you mean it.",
        "Livvie: Ok -- it never happened.",
        "Imani: Good. And now that our little business meeting is finished --",
        "Livvie: She's all yours.",
        "Jamal: Hey -- Livvie? What the hell's Livvie doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: What is wrong with you? Stop being paranoid.",
        "Chris: I'm just saying Kevin and Lucy go way back.",
        "Ian: And now he's paralyzed and needs some help. We're doing it for Christina.",
        "Chris: I can see that. I mean, I have a vested d interest in Christina as well.",
        "Ian: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: You didn't know? She was named after me. You know, her mom and I were really close, and I brought her into this world. So like it or not, it does concern me what happens in that house.",
        "Ian: Well, Christina's going to be fine, and Lucy and I are, as well.",
        "Chris: Ok. Well, that's great, but just take it from a friend. I'd keep my eye on Kevin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Do you still have feelings for me?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Of course I do. I will have feelings for you until the day I die. After everything we've been through, that kind of caring just doesn't go away.",
        "Kevin: Don't just say what you think I want to hear.",
        "Lucy: Wouldn't do that. I give you my word. But we need to be clear. This is today, this is right now, and this is a different time.",
        "Kevin: Then we're clear. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I just needed to hear it.",
        "Lucy: You've chased down so many demons, you've been through so much, and you've always been strong through all that. And right now if you don't feel strong, that's ok. You can feel strong later, because you have me in your corner and I am going to help you get through this.",
        "Kevin: Well, you're still the world's greatest cheerleader.",
        "Lucy: Thanks. I'll do a jump later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: No big mystery. I -- well, Livvie came by to apologize. I ran into her in the alley, and we had a few words.",
        "Jamal: Livvie never goes out of her way to apologize. Trust me, she wants something.",
        "Imani: Well, whatever it is she wants, she's not getting anything from me.",
        "Jamal: Good.",
        "Imani: And you're here because?",
        "Jamal: What, I don't have to have a reason to come by, now, do I?",
        "Imani: No. But you have one, right?",
        "Jamal: All right. Well, look, I know you're not going to take me up on my offer to stay at my apartment or anything --",
        "Imani: What are you doing?",
        "Jamal: But, look, I want to make your place a little bit safer, so I got you a couple of door jam locks, a couple of window locks, a little of this, a little of that. And I know, you don't have to tell me, you know, sticking my nose in your business kind of pisses you off, so --",
        "Imani: No, not at all.",
        "Jamal: What, you're not mad at me?",
        "Imani: I was just thinking that this is probably the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me.",
        "Jamal: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Buzz off, Jack. I am -- I am not in a good mood. I haven't had a good day. Actually, it's been a very, very bad, long day.",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm so sorry. I was just going to ask you if you'd like --",
        "Livvie: Please, please don't ask, ok? I'm not in the mood for another one of your \"I hate Livvie\" lectures. In fact, I'd be perfectly happy if you never talked to me ever again. Now, give me a drink, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey, would you look at that! Why don't you go say hi to daddy.",
        "Christina: Daddy!",
        "Kevin: Hey! Come here, you!",
        "Lucy: Punkinhead, maybe not go to his lap, ok, just yet. Why don't you jump up on the couch?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, that's a good idea, and then you can give daddy a nice big kiss.",
        "Lucy: Oh, be careful. Yeah, yeah! Uh-oh.",
        "Kevin: Oh, what a great gift that is. Hey, did you have fun making pictures with grandma Gail?",
        "Christina: She doesn't do it like you, daddy.",
        "Lucy: Well, nobody paints quite like your daddy, huh?",
        "Christina: Daddy can paint with me now?",
        "Kevin: Well, not quite yet, honey, but soon, ok?",
        "Lucy: Real soon. He's going to heal up in no time, and you guys will be painting my bathroom walls, maybe, and I'll be cleaning up the mess, huh?",
        "Kevin: Hey, how about I read you a story? Would you like that?",
        "Lucy: That's a great idea. Pick out your favorite book and we'll all read it together.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, make it a big one because daddy's got a lot of time on his hands right now.",
        "Lucy: Hey, maybe you don't want to go with that particular book.",
        "Christina: I like this one.",
        "Lucy: I know you like this one. It happens to be our wedding album. I know you like it a lot. Come here, you. Ok, what you got there? Let me see.",
        "Kevin: Well, whatever page she stops at --",
        "Lucy: Oh, that was right before -- remember, you were going to carry mommy and daddy's wedding rings into the ceremony.",
        "Christina: I had flowers in my hair.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, you know, you were the most beautiful girl at the whole wedding. Except for your mommy, of course.",
        "Christina: Daddy's so handsome.",
        "Lucy: Well, would you look at that. There's another one. There's you and me and your daddy, all three of us, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, Livvie, out.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Jack: Go, out. You're not going to come in here and talk to me that way. Get out of here! This is my bar. You can go.",
        "Livvie: Are you kidding? Where am I going to go, Jack?",
        "Jack: Take it someplace else.",
        "Livvie: Ugh --",
        "Jack: I'm not going to sit here and listen to your pity party.",
        "Livvie: Do you see what I mean?",
        "Jack: Yeah, see what I mean. Livvie, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Livvie: Wait what, Jack?",
        "Jack: Stop, ok?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: I'm in a bad mood.",
        "Livvie: Me, too.",
        "Jack: Ok, well, fine. We can be in bad moods together.",
        "Livvie: Why are you suddenly being nice to me?",
        "Jack: You can't hold grudges forever, right? I mean, it takes too much energy.",
        "Livvie: Then what are you saying? That the war between us is over, then?",
        "Jack: All I'm saying is you're not such a bad person.",
        "Livvie: Thanks. I -- I really needed to hear that. Thank you.",
        "Jack: You're welcome.",
        "Livvie: I'll be back.",
        "Jack: That's right, Livvie. Thanks for buying that load of B.S. It's payback time.",

        "Jamal: Should I get started on installing your hardware?",
        "Imani: Be my guest.",
        "Jamal: Well, all right. And then what do you say after that we go -- damn.",
        "Imani: Is something wrong?",
        "Jamal: Yeah. I kind of forgot my hammer.",
        "Imani: Oh, hold on. Don't move.",
        "Jamal: Oh, come on. Don't tell me you got one.",
        "Imani: Ok. It may be a little rusty, but will this do?",
        "Jamal: You keep a hammer under your pillow?",
        "[Jamal laughs]",
        "Imani: I told you, I'm into hardware.",
        "Jamal: Hey, whatever. It saves me a trip going back to my place. Just toss it here and I'll get started. Oh -- damn.",
        "Imani: Jamal, are you ok? Did I just hit --",
        "Jamal: No, you didn't hit me.",
        "Imani: Are you sure?",
        "Jamal: I just got some splinter or something in my eye --",
        "Imani: No, no, wait, come here, come here. Wait, no, no, come here, come here, have a seat. Let me take a look.",
        "Jamal: Oh. Ahah, damn, I hate when that happens.",
        "Imani: Ok. Well, hold on.",
        "Jamal: It's in my left eye. Oh, can you see?",
        "Imani: All right, hold on. Relax, relax.",
        "Jamal: All right.",
        "Imani: Oh, there it is, in the corner.",
        "Jamal: You can see it?",
        "Imani: I can see it. Ok, now, listen, I'm going to do something that my grandmother taught me, ok?",
        "Jamal: All right, do what you got to do.",
        "Imani: All right.",
        "Imani: How's your eye?",

        "Jamal: Huh.",
        "Imani: You better answer that.",

        "[Ring]",
        "Jamal: Jamal. Yeah, but I thought I gave that to you already. Fine, ok, fine. Yeah, I'll come down there and make it official. Yeah, right now. All right, bye. I will come back to finish this a little later.",
        "Imani: Yeah, that'd be great.",
