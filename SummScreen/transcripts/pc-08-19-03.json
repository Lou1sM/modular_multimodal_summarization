        "After going running with Rafe, Alison sits down to enjoy the sun and is annoyed to see that Caleb has found her. When she admits to being disappointed in him, he teases her and advises her to just move on. Alison accuses him of having been cruel to her. She believes that he never cared about her and that their friendship meant nothing to him. After sharing a long, slow kiss with Jamal, Imani admits that it was wonderful--and a big mistake. When she tells him that she isn't free to become involved with him, Jamal assumes that she's in love with someone else. Imani explains her fear that he will regret ever having met her. He promises to call her later and then heads to the police station to check on the situation with his stolen bike. A phone call unnerves Imani, but the caller assures her that everything is all right. After initially taking Jack's compliments at face value, Olivia realizes that he was lying to her. Jack retracts his compliments and changes the subject. When he says that he wants to change, Olivia concludes that he wants her back. Jack thinks this is hilarious. Olivia regrets confiding in him about her problems. Rafe comes in and eavesdrops from the bar. Jack is stunned to hear that she blames Alison for her problems with Caleb. He uses this belief to rub in the idea that it would be hard for any man to resist sweet, beautiful Alison. Rafe becomes angry, leaves, and calls Jack from outside. Jack goes to meet Rafe, who attacks him for using Alison as bait. Jack tells him to do this himself, but it's too late. Olivia confronts them, saying that she knew that something was up."

        "Rafe's voice: Did you think about that? Did you think about what that means for Livvie to have that ring, that kind of power? Do you understand that?",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Livvie: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Did you powder your nose?",
        "Livvie: Very funny. I'm being serious here. Something's wrong. Something is just a little bit off.",
        "Jack: Ok, like what?",
        "Livvie: You said that I was loveable, right?",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Livvie: Ok, and I've had a really lousy couple of days, and I'm, I don't know, maybe feeling a little vulnerable, so I needed to hear that.",
        "Jack: So you said.",
        "Livvie: Nice try, Jack.",
        "Jack: Huh?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I came close. I mean, this close to believing that you were actually standing there, actually honestly trying to be nice to me.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's right, I was.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and then I came to my senses and I said, \"this is Jack. This is you, the one person in this world who hates me more than anyone.\" So you want to tell me why you went through all the trouble of lying to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey!",
        "Rafe: Ok, you win.",
        "Alison: As usual.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Now we stretch.",
        "Alison: No, I don't want to. I hate that part.",
        "Rafe: All right, come on, I know you hate it. But you're going to hate those calves hurting even more.",
        "Alison: Fine. Fine, fine, fine.",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Alison: I'll do it.",
        "Rafe: All right, let's take care of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison's voice: I promise, you are doing the right thing by giving this to me.",
        "Caleb: Well, I had a good teacher. I've watched you, you know, how you always put other people first. That's -- that's a quality I've always admired.",
        "Alison: You won't be sorry. I will make sure that this ring never hurts another person again.",
        "Caleb: Alison, just one thing --",
        "Alison: I really need to get going, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: The ring -- it is beautiful, isn't it?",
        "Alison: I will take really good care of it.",
        "Caleb: I know you will. But are you sure that maybe you wouldn't rather have this one?",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, you tricked me.",
        "Caleb: Although yours is a -- a pretty good fake. Huh. But I assure you, this is the one you came for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Hey, Alison, you all right?",
        "Alison: What? Yeah, fine, why?",
        "Rafe: No, nothing. You just seem a little distracted.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry. Boy.",
        "Rafe: No, it's ok. Did you want to talk about it?",
        "Alison: No, no, it's really -- you know, it's nothing. I just have a lot of stuff on my mind, with the club and the, you know, the line of clothes --",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah, I just get worried, you know.",
        "Alison: Well -- well, don't. You know, it's just that -- I don't know, it's just --",
        "Rafe: I know, Caleb and the ring and --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: And all that stuff, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah, you know, all of it.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Well, oh, I got to get back to the gym. Got a kickboxing class in an hour. Are you ready?",
        "Alison: No. Do you care if I just -- if I just stay? The sun feels kind of good.",
        "Rafe: No, that -- that's cool. You stay. I really got to get back, though, so --",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: I'll see you back at the gym.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: All right.",
        "Alison: And wait, wait -- do me a favor, will you, please? Just try not to worry about me so much, ok?",
        "Rafe: Hey, do I look worried?",
        "Alison: A little.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I am. But I'm trying, all right? I'll see you at home.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Caleb: What a beautiful day.",
        "Alison: Well, it was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Imani --",
        "Imani: Shh.",
        "Jamal: What are you thinking right now?",
        "Imani: I'm thinking that there's about a hundred different things tumbling through my head.",
        "Jamal: Like what?",
        "Imani: Well, that I'm going to be thinking about this kiss all day now.",
        "Jamal: And tonight?",
        "Imani: Probably for the rest of the night, too.",
        "Jamal: Just \"probably,\" huh? Huh.",
        "Imani: And I'm just thinking how -- how strange it is that I've met somebody like you -- at this time, I mean.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. What else?",
        "Imani: And I'm thinking that my lips are --",
        "Jamal: Your lips are what?",
        "Imani: They're still tingling. And I'm wondering if you could possibly be feeling half of the things I'm feeling right now.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, I could tell you what I'm feeling right now if --",
        "Imani: And I'm thinking that -- I wonder if any man has kissed a woman the way that you just kissed me right now. And I'm --",
        "Jamal: And?",
        "Imani: Mostly thinking --",
        "[Imani sighs]",
        "Jamal: What?",
        "Imani: That this is a big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, you are a sad person. Has anyone ever told you that? Huh?",
        "Livvie: Sad because I know a lie when I hear one?",
        "Jack: No, sad because I gave you a simple compliment, and you're starting to get suspicious. It's not like I crowned you Miss America or anything. I said you were a lovely person, just like any stray dog.",
        "Livvie: Now, that's the Jack I remember.",
        "Jack: Fine. You know what? Take it however you want to take it, but what can I possibly gain from giving you a compliment?",
        "Livvie: Who knows?",
        "Jack: Who knows?",
        "Livvie: Jack, I don't. All I know is that this has been the nicest you've been to me in a really long time. And don't pretend like you don't hold any grudges because you do. I'm the same way, I know. And don't think for two seconds I actually believe that you would be nice to me and forgive me because you wouldn't. I know you better than that.",
        "Jack: Fine, fine. I take it back. You feel better now?",
        "Livvie: Honest, at least.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I was trying to be. Speaking of honesty, I've been thinking about what you said in the elevator the other day.",
        "Livvie: What was that?",
        "Jack: About me being unhappy and bitter.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "Jack: No, you were right, and I have been. And that's why Reese and I broke up, and -- well, I figure it's time to start taking a good look at myself and changing.",
        "Livvie: Changing? Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, I get it. You and Reese are having trouble, so why not jump on the Livvie bandwagon? \"Sad, pathetic Livvie,\" right?",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? Do you really think that?",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, Jack, admit it.",
        "Jack: Admit it?",
        "Livvie: Yes.",
        "Jack: No, the only thing that I'm going to admit is you're not just sad, you're completely insane to think that I would get mixed up with you again. Look, you made your bed of nails with that bloodsucking hero, so why don't you go home and sleep in it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb, why don't you get out of here? I don't want to see you, and I especially don't want to talk to you.",
        "Caleb: Are you still angry?",
        "Alison: No, I don't really think that \"angry\" is the right word.",
        "Caleb: Furious? Disgusted? Am I getting warm?",
        "Alison: More like really disappointed.",
        "Caleb: No, not that. Not \"disappointed.\" Say it isn't so.",
        "Alison: I can see that it means as much to you as I thought that it would.",
        "Caleb: Look, you came to me thinking you could sweet-talk me out of my ring. You -- you were wrong. What are you going to do, sulk about it for the rest of your life?",
        "Alison: What would you like me to do? Do you want me to just forget about it? Is that it? Is that what you'd like me to do?",
        "Caleb: Well, that would be a good start.",
        "Alison: No, I'm sorry, I can't do that.",
        "Caleb: Look, you tried a con, it didn't work. You move on. Nothing's changed.",
        "Alison: You're wrong, Caleb. Everything has changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Imani, trust me, you and me, we're not a mistake. That kiss was not a mistake, and don't try to say you didn't enjoy it because I know that you did.",
        "Imani: No, I never said that.",
        "Jamal: Well, then, what are you saying, then?",
        "Imani: What I'm saying is that nothing can ever happen between us.",
        "Jamal: Why not?",
        "Imani: Because --",
        "Jamal: Imani, why? Because what?",
        "Imani: Because I'm not free, ok? I cannot get involved with you.",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok, don't tell me that you're still in love with this guy that's been chasing you around town.",
        "Imani: No.",
        "Jamal: Well, are you in love with somebody else, then?",
        "Imani: No. Listen, you know everything that you need to know about my situation. It could be dangerous for you to get involved with me.",
        "Jamal: Well, you know what? Too late because I'm already involved. Ok, that's just the way it is, and so are you. Look, we've been dancing around each other ever since you dropped into my bed that day. And I know I'm sticking my neck way out there, but, Imani, what I'm feeling and what I think you're feeling, too -- it doesn't come along every single day. At least not for me it doesn't.",
        "Imani: I feel it, too.",
        "Jamal: Ok, so how can you just back away from that? How can you just back away without giving it a shot? You owe us at least that much.",
        "Imani: Jamal, you don't know what you're saying. Believe me.",
        "Jamal: No, no, believe me. I know what I see and I know what I want.",
        "Imani: I'm scared. Is that clear enough for you?",
        "Jamal: My god, tell me what you're scared of.",
        "Imani: Oh, god.",
        "Jamal: What are you scared of? Are you scared of me?",
        "Imani: I'm scared for you. I'm scared that, in time, if you -- if we do this, I'm scared that you're going to be sorry that you ever met me.",
        "[Jamal scoffs]",
        "Jamal: Just -- that's silly. That's --",
        "Imani: Jamal, trust me. You have to believe me.",
        "Jamal: No, no, believe me. That could never, ever happen, ok?",
        "[Imani sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Believe me, Jack, I don't need your opinion about my relationship.",
        "Jack: Too bad.",
        "Livvie: I know exactly what you think about me and Caleb.",
        "Jack: Well, you're the one who brought it up.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, right, my mistake. Stupid me, confiding in you about all my problems.",
        "Jack: Oh, the only problem you have is the same problem you had when we were together.",
        "Livvie: Oh, look out, here comes Dr. Jack.",
        "Jack: Livvie you cannot be loved enough. And maybe you never will.",
        "Livvie: Like you know everything.",
        "Jack: No, what I do know is you and Caleb have everything you've ever wanted, including that ring. So why wouldn't you be happy? Instead, you're walking around being depressed, taking it out on whoever you come in contact with.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, maybe I like torturing you, that's why.",
        "Jack: Or maybe you haven't learned a damn thing.",
        "Livvie: What? What, are you telling me that all of my problems with Caleb are my fault?",
        "Jack: I'm not saying all of them, but then I know Caleb too well. But what I'm saying, Livvie, is you always blame somebody else. I'm just telling you this for your own good.",
        "Livvie: Oh, right, and you're a saint?",
        "Jack: Come on, you -- you blamed Alison for breaking up us. I mean, who are you going to point the figure at now? I mean, who's it going to be? Oh, don't tell me that. You got to be kidding me.",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on. Why does everyone think she's such an innocent bystander all the time?",
        "Jack: Well, Caleb's not --",
        "Livvie: You should see the way she throws herself at him, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, Caleb's not exactly fighting that off.",
        "Livvie: Well, what are you saying?",
        "Jack: What I'm saying is you don't know a damn thing about guys. I'm not saying Caleb's off hooking up with Alison, but come on, Alison's a beautiful, sweet girl, and it'd be tough for any guy not to respond to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Everything's changed? What, we're not friends anymore because I had a little fun with you?",
        "Alison: A little fun with me? Why don't you give me a break? I came to you with my heart on my sleeve, hoping to talk to you honestly, and you used it against me. You enjoyed being cruel to me.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, you're enjoying this -- making it into some sort of tragedy because I hurt your little feelings, you know? Come on, you know how I am, all right? Snap out of it. Come on, toughen up a little.",
        "Alison: Why? So I can be more like you? No. No, thank you, really. I don't want to go around hurting good people's feelings and not caring what they think or what they feel. You know, I thought maybe having spent a little time as a human being that you would've changed somehow, maybe that you would've learned something.",
        "Caleb: You were wrong.",
        "Alison: Well, now I know.",
        "Caleb: Now you know. But don't blame me because of what you thought, Alison. No, this mistake is yours, not mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: So, are you cool now?",
        "Imani: Cool enough, I guess.",
        "Jamal: Yeah? Good.",
        "Imani: You know, you should go. You should go to the police station and check on your precious bike.",
        "Jamal: Oh, Imani, don't even try to get rid of me that fast. Those cops can wait to hear about my stolen bike. All right, but for right now, I'm not leaving until you tell me when and where I'm seeing you again. And I'm not taking no for an answer, so don't even try it.",
        "Imani: Dinner?",
        "Jamal: Tonight?",
        "Imani: What's wrong? Is that too soon?",
        "Jamal: No, no. To tell you the truth, I was -- I was thinking more like, maybe some lunch and then a little snack in between and then maybe some tea at tea time and then get to the dinner, but I guess I'll wait for the dinner. You know, I'll just make it a real special one.",
        "Imani: So I'll meet you at the pizza shack.",
        "Jamal: The pizza shack? I said special dinner. No, I'm going to take you someplace that really shows you how special I think you are.",
        "Imani: Oh, Jamal. You do that just about every time we're together.",
        "Jamal: Just about every time?",
        "Imani: I said, just about every time.",
        "[Jamal laughs]",
        "Jamal: Well, it looks like a brother got something to work on, then, huh? Closing that gap between \"just about every single time\" to \"every single time.\" So I'll call you.",
        "Imani: Ok.",
        "Jamal: And I'll pick you up.",
        "Imani: Ok.",
        "Jamal: All right. I'll let myself out.",

        "Woman: Imani, sweetheart, it's me.",
        "Imani: What -- what happened? Did -- did they find you? What's wrong? Did something happen? Why -- why are you --",
        "Woman: Everything's fine, honey. Just calm down.",
        "Imani: Well, Madea, you know that you're not supposed to call me unless there's an --",
        "Madea: Emergencies only, I know. But I needed to hear your voice.",
        "Imani: Well, it's good to hear yours, too. I missed you, but --",
        "Madea: When are you going to come to see me? Please, sweetheart. Imani I want to see you, too, you know that. I really miss you, but I cannot, and you know why. I cannot take the risk of them finding me, ever. I cannot have them find me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: No. You saw what you wanted to see. But I am who I am. I don't pretend. But you need to feel safe, so you create this whole illusion that I was like you.",
        "Alison: You know what, Caleb? You broke a promise to me. You promised that you would never hurt me.",
        "Caleb: And I didn't.",
        "Alison: No, not physically.",
        "Caleb: Guilt trips don't work on me, Alison. Your definition of being hurt isn't even on my radar.",
        "Alison: I started to trust you. And I really thought that you started to trust me, too.",
        "Caleb: What? Do you think I was just going to give you the ring because you asked for it?",
        "Alison: Well, I expected for you to at least hear me out. And whether or not you gave me the ring -- well, that's a different story. But I never expected for you to treat me the way you did.",
        "Caleb: Oh, go cry to your boyfriend.",
        "Alison: I wish that I could. I do. But I'm too embarrassed to tell him that I even went to go see you. He always told me, \"Caleb should never be trusted,\" but I thought differently. So obviously, he was right and I was wrong. I thought that you would've changed, but I can see that you won't.",
        "Caleb: You know, I'd almost forgotten how comfortable humans are at playing the victim. It's what you do best.",
        "Alison: Right. Well, it's vampires like you that like to drain and torture people. That's what you do best.",
        "Caleb: If you say so.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. And what if I were to say that you never gave a damn about me, ever, that everything you've ever told me was just one big lie? That our friendship meant absolutely nothing to you? Huh? This whole thing was, like, one big game that I happened to fall into. You've never cared whether -- whether or not you've ever hurt my feelings or anything in regards to that, huh? Would that be safe to say, Caleb? I mean, is that really how you feel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: So are you telling me you actually had a thing for Alison, too?",
        "Jack: I gave it some thought at one time, yeah.",
        "Livvie: One time? What, when we were together?",
        "Jack: Why do you care, considering who you're with?",
        "Livvie: I can't believe it. You, too, Jack. I can't believe this! Come on!",
        "Jack: Just because you think somebody is attracted doesn't mean you're not in love with the person you're with. Come on, sometimes it makes you realize how happy you are anyway.",
        "Livvie: Why are we even talking about this?",
        "Jack: I don't know why we're talking about this. You're the one that brought this up.",
        "Livvie: I was saying that Alison threw herself all over Caleb.",
        "Jack: Oh, right, right --",
        "Livvie: I am not threatened by her.",
