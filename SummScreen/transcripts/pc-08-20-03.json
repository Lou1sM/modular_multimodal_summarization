        "Lucy's prolonged efforts to work the feeling back into Kevin's hand only serve to frustrate Kevin and annoy Ian. Unwilling to take a break, Lucy turns down Ian's invitation to lie down with him for a little while. Feeling guilty, she goes to Ian and lies down with him. Before they can make love, Kevin cries out in frustration from the living room, causing Lucy to push Ian away. Pleased to have caught Jack and Rafe conspiring against her, Olivia rejects Jack's explanation and calls him a liar. Jack makes up a story about Rafe's attempts to keep him from getting involved with her again. Rafe goes along with this and accuses Jack of having no pride. Olivia regrets giving Jack a hard time. Jack says that he simply refuses to let Rafe control him the way Caleb tries to control the vampires, but Olivia is convinced that he still cares about her. Jack tells her to pick up the things she left at his house before he tosses them out, encouraging her to use her key if he's not there. When he has to leave, she assumes that he's meeting a woman. She calls home, but Caleb is gone again. Meanwhile, Caleb laughs at the idea of caring about what Alison thinks of him. Alison believes it irritates him to know that she isn't swayed by his charms. She boasts that Rafe is superior to him. Rafe appears and reminds the vampire that he's supposed to stay away from Alison. Although she tries to stop him, Caleb starts dropping hints about their meeting. This forces Alison to come clean about what happened the night before. When Rafe and Caleb argue about the women in their lives, Caleb advises Rafe to love Alison now, because as mortals, they don't have eternity. Rafe fills Alison in on his plan to get the ring back, and Alison insists on allowing Jack to use her as bait. When Caleb returns home, Olivia isn't there. She lets herself into Jack's house and starts looking for her things. Fresh from the shower and wearing only a towel, Jack greets her."

        "Lucy: Some yoga masters really do believe that all our energy is centered in our hands. So I think all we need to do is find a way just to release it.",
        "Kevin: Well, that sounds great, Lucy, but it's been sounding great for the last hour.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Tell me, can you feel that at all?",
        "Kevin: Nothing.",
        "Lucy: Ok. What about that? Can you feel that now? Now?",
        "Kevin: Sorry.",
        "Lucy: No, it's ok. Um, let's try something else. I want you to visualize, I want you to picture yourself actually moving your fingers, ok?",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh.",
        "Lucy: Ok, close your eyes, close your eyes. Come on, close your eyes. I want you to focus. Take a deep breath and picture all the energy going into your fingers and making them move. See, there's got to be a trigger or some blockage that we can reach.",
        "Kevin: All right, Lucy, Lucy, wait. Please, just stop. You're not helping.",
        "Lucy: You're not even giving this a chance. Come on.",
        "Ian: The man knows what he's feeling.",
        "Kevin: Or not feeling.",
        "Lucy: I am not just going to give up here.",
        "Ian: No one said anything about giving up, but maybe you can give it a break, huh? Come on, sometimes that helps.",
        "Lucy: No, I don't want to quit.",
        "Ian: Right now. Come on.",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "Ian: Excuse us, please.",
        "Kevin: Oh, well, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: What are you doing?",
        "Ian: You know what I'm doing and I know what you're doing, and it's no use.",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, it's no use?",
        "Ian: No one can conjure up a miracle, not even you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Well, well, well. Look who's here.",
        "Rafe: Livvie.",
        "Livvie: My instincts are always right. Jack, you were being too nice, and now I know why.",
        "Jack: Oh, you've got it all figured out, don't you?",
        "Livvie: Yes, I do, and it probably has something to do with Caleb or else he wouldn't be here.",
        "Jack: Ding, ding, ding! Give the lady a prize. Well, guess what, Livvie -- you're wrong. Go ahead, Rafe, tell her what you've been doing behind her back.",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Jack: Go ahead, she's caught you. We might as well tell her. What, you're not going to say anything? Ok, then I guess I'm going to have to do the dirty work. Well, Rafe here has been telling me what a big mistake it would be for me to get mixed up back with you.",
        "Livvie: Really?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Livvie: I see. And I bet you were setting him straight, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Livvie: Liar!",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Livvie, when have this guy and I ever been friends, huh? He's the big, bad vampire-slayer. You guys are the vampires, and Rafe here is trying to make sure that you're not trying to recruit anybody else. Right, Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that's right. You don't have any pride, do you, Jack?",
        "Jack: No, I don't. And you know what, I'm also done with you trying to tell me how to live my life. So get lost.",
        "Rafe: Ok. You do what you want. It's your life. You jump off a cliff, right into that black hole, that's fine, but whatever happens to you now, you deserve it.",
        "Jack: I deserve it. Huh. I deserve it. Well, it's so good to be back in the middle of all this. Kind of feels like old times.",
        "Livvie: No, wait, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, no, you wait. I've been trying to sit here and make peace with you, put the past in the past, and you're sitting here telling me that I'm a liar, I have Rafe trying to tell me how to live my life. And you know what I have to say to the both of you? Go to hell, Livvie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Is that really how you feel, Caleb? You really don't give a damn?",
        "Caleb: About what you think? You got to be kidding.",
        "Alison: You're lying.",
        "Caleb: Really? Ok, this ought to be good. Now, why would someone like me care about what someone like you thinks?",
        "Alison: Because I know how to get to you.",
        "Caleb: How's that?",
        "Alison: I've seen you operate, Caleb. I've seen you operate my own mother. Those longing stares, the raspy voice. And it's good. I'm telling you, it is so good. But it doesn't work on me, and I think on some level that really irritates you.",
        "Caleb: So let me get this straight -- you're a challenge for me, is that it?",
        "Alison: Well, you're not exactly immune to vanity. I mean, you did come back as a rock star so that more women could fall at your feet.",
        "Caleb: Oh, what's an immortal rock star to do?",
        "Alison: Why don't you open your immortal eyes and see the person who's standing on their own two feet across from you and believe that I am not amused and I am not impressed by you whatsoever. And do you want to know why?",
        "Caleb: I have a funny feeling you're going to tell me.",
        "Alison: Because I have a real man, Caleb. I have a real gentle man. So I see through all of your tricks and your little games. My man has a real heart and a real soul, would do anything for me. He would even go to hell and back.",
        "Caleb: That's a slow Tuesday for me, sweetheart. Literally done that without breaking a sweat.",
        "Alison: I think you know deep down inside that Rafe is twice the man that you will ever be. And, yeah, I think that that bothers you. And far as your so- called charm and your power, I think you're totally empty inside and you are absolutely nothing without your little tricks and your stupid little ring. Oh, the truth hurts, doesn't it, Caleb?",
        "Caleb: Your truth. Now it's my turn.",
        "Rafe: Oh, good, because I can't wait. Come on. I'm listening, vampire. Come on. Enlighten me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You've been trying alternative treatments for hours now.",
        "Lucy: That's right, I have, and I'm not going to stop now because I'm not just hoping for some sort of miracle. I am trying to make him better. I want Kevin better.",
        "Ian: He needs to rest. That's what he needs is rest. Go look at him.",
        "Lucy: Ok. All right. Maybe you're right. I am pushing a little too hard.",
        "Ian: Why?",
        "Lucy: Why? You know why. Because the sooner he gets well, then --",
        "Ian: The sooner we can get back to, what, our version of a normal life? He's got a serious injury, so maybe we should give nature a chance to work it out. He needs a break. So do you. Look at me. Let's go lay down for a few minutes, ok?",
        "Lucy: I can't.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Lucy: Ian --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey. Listen, are you ok? I think I'm going to go -- I'm going to go upstairs and just rest a little while. Are you going to be ok alone?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'm fine. Relax, Lucy. Go ahead. I'll be ok.",
        "Lucy: Ok, then.",
        "Kevin: Alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Jack, listen, here you are defending my honor, and I --",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait a minute. Defending your honor? How can I defend something like that when it doesn't even exist? I was defending myself. You know how Caleb thinks he can control all the vampires? Rafe thinks he can tell all the rest of us how to live. Well, I'm done with that. I call my own shots now, whether he likes it or not.",
        "Livvie: Wait, so what you were saying --",
        "Jack: No, no, no.",
        "Livvie: Stop it! I want to talk to you! Don't just walk away from me like that! Wait! Wait a minute.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Livvie: So what you were saying earlier about me being lovable and stuff, what, that was a bunch of bull?",
        "Jack: You, you, you. It's always about you. Yeah, Livvie, I meant it. You want to know why? No, it's not because I'm still hooked up on you. Nothing is going on between us. Nothing will ever be going on between us. I don't even ever entertain that thought.",
        "Livvie: I hurt you, Jack. I know I hurt you. And I hurt, too, ok?",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: I'm lonely sometimes, too.",
        "Jack: Come on, it's you, you, you! It's always about you. So get this straight -- you -- you feel alone? Well, I'm the one who's alone. And while I am, you have the vampire of your dreams, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Your girlfriend was just telling me how you're the grand prize in the love sweepstakes.",
        "Rafe: Yeah? That's funny, because I told you to stay away from her. Now, what part of that sailed right over your head?",
        "Caleb: That's true, you did warn me to stay away, and that was -- well, that was long before last night.",
        "Rafe: Last night? What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Caleb: You see that? Just the notion of spending some time together, Alison, and just talking --",
        "Rafe: What are you talking about?",
        "Alison: Don't.",
        "Rafe: You need to get out of here now. Do you understand?",
        "Caleb: Get out of here? We were just starting to have a little fun. Now, where were we, Alison? You were telling me about how your love is pure and there's no lies, no secrets --",
        "Rafe: All right, you know what --",
        "Alison: Ok, wait, wait. Stop, stop, that's enough, that's enough. Stop it. Look, I'm sorry, he's just trying to get to us and to get to me because I did go see him last night. And I'm sorry. I just tried to convince him to give me his ring and to give up this war, and now he's trying to use it between us to cause us some trouble. See that, Caleb? I do know you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Sorry.",
        "Ian: Come here.",
        "Ian: Hmm. That feels good.",
        "Lucy: You feel so good. You're also right again about me trying to help too much is not helping Kevin.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Lucy: It's not helping any of us. And you're also right about that miracle thing. I really want a miracle. In fact, I think what's really bad is I'm expecting a miracle, and I'm thinking that's not helping anybody.",
        "Ian: Well, you're trying to do what's best for Kevin.",
        "Lucy: You're right. Of course I am. That's the good part of me. The bad part of me, though, the selfish part, oh, I just want this over. I want him to get better and get out of here so that we can go on with our lives.",
        "Ian: Shh.",
        "Lucy: But do you know what I really, really, really need?",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. You need to rest.",
        "Lucy: No, you're wrong. What I need is to make love to you and to prove to you that you are --",
        "Ian: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You don't need to prove anything to me. I know how you feel because I can see it in your eyes, can feel it in your heart. Will you look at that? You can feel it in mine.",
        "Lucy: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: You hate that I'm with Caleb, don't you?",
        "Jack: Livvie, I don't care who you're with. You be with whoever you want to be. I'm cool with that, have been for a long time. I packed all that away when I boxed all your things up.",
        "Livvie: My things? What things?",
        "Jack: Your -- I don't know, the garbage things, you know? I mean, the garbage.",
        "Livvie: Jack Ramsey, you kept my things?",
        "Jack: No, no, I didn't keep all your things. Look, if you know me, you would know that I wanted the stuff out of my house a long time ago. So if you would, you can come by, even right now if you want to, and pick that stuff up.",
        "Livvie: Um -- yeah, I can't. I -- I've got to get home.",
        "Jack: To Caleb, right? Yeah, well, that's why you're still here wasting your time with me. But suit yourself. You have a key, so please come by and get those sooner or later because I'm probably going to get rid of them, and I actually have someplace to be.",
        "Livvie: Whoa, whoa, Jack, who is she?",
        "Jack: Wouldn't you like to know.",
        "Livvie: I've got a life of my own. That's right, I've got a great life. I'm with the man that I love, and I will be with him for all eternity. And he's -- not answering the phone. He's not home. He's never home anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Obviously, you two have a lot to talk about, so maybe I should just --",
        "Alison: Thanks. Look, I know I said that my mother needed to talk to me, but I had this idea, and I thought that it was a really good idea at the time.",
        "Caleb: And it was. Noble, really. Alison was sure that all it would take was a little kindness to turn everything around. Well, she was very persuasive. I mean that. You should've seen her. She appealed passionately to my strong sense of justice and fair play and, well, she charmed that ring right off my finger.",
        "Alison: Oh --",
        "Rafe: You what?",
        "Caleb: Not the real ring, of course. But still, that's -- that's some fine woman you got there, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what, you have no idea what kind of woman she is, all right? Then again, why would you?",
        "Alison: Ok, you know what, it's ok, Rafe. Let's just let this go.",
        "Rafe: Alison is there for me always. Ok, she tells me the truth always, no matter what.",
        "Caleb: Noticed that. You get bonus points for honesty.",
        "Rafe: And how many negative points for your woman, huh? The bottomless pit of \"I want, I need.\" I mean, it's never enough for Livvie, right? Not enough blood, not enough love.",
        "Caleb: Well, now, that's just mean. You'll never understand what we have. It would take you two a lifetime to get that close. Of course, you don't have that, do you? The truth is she will grow old and she will die. So love her while you can, slayer. Right now, I have a whirlwind of passion waiting for me at home, desperate to love me.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I'd say \"desperate\" is a good word for it.",
        "Alison: Ok, look, Rafe, I'm really sorry. Please let me apologize. I just -- I need to talk to you about this. I know that I said that my mother needed to see me and all that kind of stuff --",
        "Rafe: It's ok. Come here.",
        "Alison: But I really -- I should've told you the truth. And I thought that I was doing the right thing at the time, I really did.",
        "Rafe: It's ok. All right, now listen, I got to tell you about something.",
        "Alison: What? What? What's going on?",
        "Rafe: Last night, when you were out, I was out, too. And I think I figured out a way to get the real ring off Caleb's finger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Can I tell you something?",
        "Lucy: Please do.",
        "Ian: You're the most amazing woman I've ever met.",
        "Ian: God, you're beautiful.",
        "Lucy: Can I tell you something?",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: You are, without a doubt, the most amazing man I've ever met.",
        "Lucy: You're beautiful.",
        "[Kevin screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So Jack is going to make Livvie crazy enough to take the ring?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that's the plan.",
        "Alison: Well, that's a really dangerous plan.",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh, I know it is. I already had to set Jack straight on a couple things.",
        "Alison: What do you mean, a couple of things?",
        "Rafe: Well, he had this brilliant idea that he was going to use you to make Livvie jealous, but I set him straight on that.",
        "Alison: Wait, why? Why? What do you mean?",
        "Rafe: I just -- I didn't want him dragging you into this.",
        "Alison: Are you crazy?",
        "Rafe: No, I'm not crazy. I don't want you in the middle of this.",
        "Alison: Oh, come on, please. Look, if anybody can make Livvie insecure, it's me. I can walk straight into a room --",
        "Rafe: Alison, stop.",
        "Alison: And there's steam already coming out her ears. So if you need that ring and you need her insecure, then I am your girl.",
        "Rafe: No, Alison --",
        "Alison: Sure.",
        "Rafe: Just stop. Just stop this, all right?",
        "Alison: There's no way you're keeping me out of this.",
        "Rafe: Yes, I am! I am! You are not going to get into this.",
        "Alison: No, yes, I am going to get into this. As a matter of fact, I insist on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Olivia! Sweetheart?",
        "Caleb's voice: Love while you can, slayer. Right now I have a whirlwind of passion waiting for me at home, desperate to love me.",
        "Caleb: Where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Hello? You told me to use my key. Ok, where is this stuff you say you have of mine? Ugh. God, it is filthy in here. Just like old times, I guess.",
        "Jack: What's like old times? Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alison: I am the one person who can get to Livvie. I can make this plan work.",
        "Rafe: I'm not going to throw you into this.",
        "Alison: This battle is just as much mine as it yours.",
        "Kevin: I can just sit here helpless while you're upstairs making love to my wife!"
