        "Kevin: Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Oh! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc! ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God. Are you all right? Where have you been? ",
        "Lucy: Are you ok? I -- I've been in another dungeon a lot like this one. We \r\nwere together in the dungeon, and then -- oh, you're ok. Are you all right? ",
        "Kevin: I'm fine, I'm -- ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Kevin: Who's this? ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Oh. Doc, this is Rafe. Rafe, this is my Doc I told you about. This is, I \r\nthink -- well, he's my cousin. ",
        "Rafe: We're related. Distant cousins, probably. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Doc, there's even more. Rafe and me, we -- well, we can \r\ncommunicate telepathically. ",
        "Kevin: You mean, he's psychic? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, yes, just like me, and there's even more. We come from a long line \r\nof slayers. That's why Caleb couldn't hurt me. That's why he couldn't hurt me.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Because why? ",
        "Lucy: \"Because why?\" Because I'm a vampire slayer. ",
        "Kevin: You're a what? ",
        "James: You should listen to her, doctor. You deserve to know why you must \r\ndie. ",

        "[Eve and Ian breathe heavily] ",
        "Eve: Hey. Excuse me. ",
        "Ian: Hello. ",
        "Eve: Can I get a little concentration here, please? ",
        "Ian: Oh, come on. You're not due for weeks. Besides, we're doctors. We know a \r\nthing or two about labor. You're fine. ",
        "Eve: Ha! Spoken like someone who has never been on the receiving end of labor \r\npains. ",
        "Ian: You're going to be just fine. ",
        "Eve: Do you know how great it is to just have to worry about normal stuff \r\nlike labor pains? ",
        "Ian: Instead of some monster trying to steal our son. ",
        "Eve: Or hurt Livvie. Now that Caleb is six feet under, life is so sweet. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Man. No sign of Livvie anywhere. ",
        "Jamal: All right, all right. All right, let's just split up. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: All right? I'll check along the riverbank. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jack: If Michael thought he killed Caleb and Caleb's still alive, then he's \r\nprobably stronger than we thought. ",
        "Alison: But how do we destroy someone who is indestructible? ",
        "Jack: I don't know, but I'm going to find a way. First I got to get to \r\nLivvie. Come on. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Livvie. Livvie. Livvie. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, my God. Caleb killed Livvie. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Hee, hee, ho. Hee, hee, hee, ho. Hee, hee, ho. Hee -- what you laughing \r\nat? ",
        "Eve: You sound like a sick owl. ",
        "Ian: I'm a trained professional. Do not make fun of your coach now. ",
        "Eve: Ok. I think you need a little more practice. Hee, hee, hoo -- ",
        "Ian: I need practice for what? ",
        "Karen: That's what I like to see -- smiles on both your faces. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. It's been a while, hasn't it? ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Karen: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: I just talked to Chris. ",
        "Karen: Yeah. We can't seem to make a breakthrough. It's like throwing darts \r\nin the dark. ",
        "Eve: Do you really think that there's a way to turn a vampire back into a \r\nhuman being? ",
        "Karen: Well, it's not exactly your everyday kind of research. ",
        "Ian: I'm going to the lab, see if I can lend a hand there. ",
        "Eve: All right. ",
        "[Door closes] ",
        "Eve: Ian wants me to relax, turn off my brain. ",
        "Karen: That sounds really good to me. I mean, not thinking about anything \r\nthat's happened. Ian's right. You really need to relax -- not just for you, but \r\nfor the baby. ",
        "Eve: I know, I know. I know. I don't know. I don't know if it's hormones or \r\nwhat, but I just -- well, there are just certain things -- people -- that I \r\ncan't talk to Ian about. Especially -- ",
        "Karen: Especially who? ",
        "Eve: Michael. I mean, I haven't seen or heard from him since we told Livvie \r\nand Jack that Caleb was dead. He was devastated. ",
        "Karen: Well, it's not surprising. He killed his brother. ",
        "Eve: Because he was a monster. ",
        "Karen: And because you asked him to. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. But then he just took off, much to Ian's relief. But Ian doesn't \r\nknow Michael the way I do. He doesn't know how much he's hurting right now. ",
        "Karen: Ian's right. Michael being gone is for the best. ",
        "Eve: How can you say that? ",
        "Karen: Because getting more involved with Michael than you already are could \r\nbe really dangerous. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: You're a fool to lock us in here. Everyone we know knows where we are.\r\n",
        "James: I doubt the town of Port Charles knows or cares where you are, but \r\nyou're about to become one of our town's unsolved mysteries. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, whatever those Morleys are paying you, we can triple it if not \r\nmore. ",
        "James: What's this, a bribe? You think me a common criminal? ",
        "Lucy: You're holding us hostage, aren't you? ",
        "James: Well, that implies I'm seeking a ransom. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, enough with the riddles. What do you want? ",
        "James: This is a chance for me to rid the world of the last of the Koviches.\r\n",
        "Kevin: And here I thought you were a civilized man. These people haven't done \r\nanything to you. ",
        "James: Well, personally, no. Mortal enemies, yes. The war between us began \r\ncenturies ago. There have been many casualties. ",
        "Rafe: On both sides! ",
        "James: Not today. Score one for the vampires. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, but you aren't a vampire. You're a human being just like us. ",
        "James: Not exactly like you, my dear. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. But why turn on your own kind? Why would you do that? ",
        "James: Vampires are superior to humans, superior in every way. I would do \r\nanything to be one of the chosen. ",
        "Lucy: Then why don't you do it? Why don't you have one of your little bat \r\nboys bite you? ",
        "James: Oh, I wish. No, but my lot in life is to serve. You know, since the \r\nbeginning of time, humans have searched, yearned for eternal life. But only \r\nvampires have achieved it. ",
        "Kevin: At what cost? Sucking the life out of others. ",
        "James: You think you're any different? Simple-minded humans wish to kill \r\nvampires because they fear not being at the top of the food chain. ",
        "Lucy: And you fear losing your little, pitiful job. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: Caleb is dead! He's dead. That boy is out of commission and you have \r\njust lost your job. ",
        "James: Master Caleb is not dead. He's as alive as you are. ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "James: And, doctor, he plans to take a bride. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, Jack. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Jamal: This is not good. Um -- ",
        "Alison: What, Jamal? ",
        "Jack and Alison: What? What? ",
        "Jamal: She's down there. ",
        "Jack: What, Livvie? What, Livvie's down there? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah -- wait, wait, wait. Jack, it's not what you think. She's -- ",
        "Jack: Jamal, come on, tell me what it is! What is it? ",
        "Jamal: She's dead. ",
        "Jack: No. No. No. Jamal, you're wrong. Livvie's not here. ",
        "Jamal: She was laying right here. She was laying right here. I even checked \r\nfor a pulse. She didn't have one. ",
        "Alison: Well, Jamal, maybe she was just unconscious or something and she woke \r\nup and she wandered off somewhere. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I know what dead is. Ok, she wasn't breathing, and her heart -- \r\nshe didn't have a heartbeat. Ok, she was wearing this long, white dress. ",
        "Alison: Like a wedding dress? ",
        "Jack: Caleb's got her. It's started. ",
        "",
        "Eve: If this is another lecture about Michael, you can just skip it because I \r\nget enough of that from Ian. Besides, Michael is not dangerous. Caleb is. ",
        "Karen: I'm not saying Michael is dangerous the same way that Caleb was. I \r\njust think that staying away from him is for the best. ",
        "Eve: Do you realize what you're saying? Do you know what that man has done \r\nfor me? He saved my child. And am I supposed to just repay that friendship by \r\nturning my back on him? ",
        "Karen: It's more than friendship, Eve. ",
        "Eve: I told you a million times, he would never act on those feelings. ",
        "Karen: Look, Eve, I can't imagine anything more appealing than a gorgeous, \r\ntortured man who's in love with you and who's willing to sacrifice the world for \r\nyou. ",
        "Eve: Karen, I am a happily married, very pregnant woman. ",
        "Karen: Who's a natural-born flirt. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Karen: And most men know it doesn't mean anything, but Michael's a priest \r\nand, in some ways, naive. ",
        "Eve: Oh, you are so misreading this. Michael knows how I feel about him. ",
        "Karen: Maybe he misread your feelings. ",
        "Eve: Nope. ",
        "Karen: Ok, think about it, Eve. I know you didn't mean this deliberately, but \r\nwhat is it? ",
        "Eve: I kissed him. But -- but it was just one of those, like, platonic, \r\nthanks-for-being-you kind of kisses. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, but you kissed a man who you know is in love with you. ",
        "Eve: You are saying I led him on. I -- oh, I didn't mean to. I didn't realize \r\nit at the time. It just never occurred to me that -- I'm so in love with Ian. \r\nBut you're right. I -- I did lead Michael on. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Jack, we have searched the woods and there's no sign of Livvie. ",
        "Jack: And I've gone all along the river. ",
        "Alison: Look, I cannot believe that Caleb has Livvie. I won't believe that, \r\nJamal! ",
        "Jamal: Look, I don't want to believe it, either. What else could've happened?\r\n",
        "Alison: She cannot become like -- ",
        "Jack: Come on, Alison, say it! Like me -- a vampire. Oh, God, I can't believe \r\nI let this happen. ",
        "Alison: Jack, this is not your fault. ",
        "Jack: No, look, I prayed that her life would be spared, that that animal \r\nwouldn't do what he's done to me. ",
        "Jamal: Jack, she's still out there somewhere. Ok, but we have to get to her \r\nbefore she's completely turned. So chill. We need you. ",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Jamal. What do you think I'm going to do, protect you guys \r\njust like I did Livvie? All I wanted was to keep her safe. ",
        "Alison: Jack, don't you do this. Ok? Don't you dare fall apart on us now. You \r\nhave got to stay strong for Livvie. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: You're wrong. Caleb's dead. ",
        "James: Many have tried to destroy him. All have failed. Caleb always \r\nsurvives. ",
        "Kevin: If that bastard you call master even touches my daughter, I swear, I \r\npromise you I'll warn her he's alive. ",
        "James: Oh, I'm certain she knows by now. ",
        "Kevin: I'll kill you! ",
        "James: You must take a more positive view of what's transpired. Your daughter \r\nwill now have everything she's ever wanted as Caleb's bride, and think about the \r\nbabies. ",
        "Kevin: Not while there's a breath in me. ",
        "James: Well, that's the not-so-positive side of your predicament. Soon you \r\nwill be quite breathless. ",
        "[James laughs] ",
        "Lucy: Wow. Oh, wow. Wow, wow, wow. ",
        "Kevin: All right, think. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Kevin: Think. ",
        "Lucy: Think. ",
        "Kevin: Think. ",
        "Lucy: Think. ",
        "Kevin: Right. Lucy, you said that you and your relative here can speak \r\ntelepathically. Well, is he telling the truth? Is Caleb dead or alive? ",
        "Rafe: I wish I knew, but we can only speak to each other telepathically. But \r\nI do know that Caleb does have a very powerful talisman. ",
        "Lucy: A talisman -- something that protects him completely? ",
        "Rafe: Some object, something. So my guess is he is still alive. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Ok. First we need to find a way to get out of here. Then we have \r\nto find out what that talisman is and then we have to use it to destroy Caleb \r\nbefore he gets his hands on Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, that's absolutely right. Oh, yoo-hoo! Mr. Gruesome guy! Oh, \r\nyoo-hoo, get in here, please! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what are you doing? ",
        "Lucy: Listen -- ",
        "Man: What do you want? ",
        "Lucy: I -- I need to speak with your master privately. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, no. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, look, I know that James would want to hear what I have to say \r\nimmediately. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please, don't do this. ",
        "Lucy: I know what I'm doing, Doc. I promise. I know exactly what I'm doing. \r\nThank you. I hope I do. ",

        "Eve: I knew Michael was in love with me, but he was committed to God. And I \r\n-- I should've noticed how he was reacting to me. ",
        "Karen: Well, you didn't lead him on intentionally. You didn't know he had \r\nthis whole \"Thornbirds\" fantasy going on. ",
        "Eve: Oh, Karen, you know what? I am a flirt. And I do know men, frocked or \r\nunfrocked. I just kept pulling him in to my life, my problems, crying on his \r\nvery sensitive shoulders. You know, I practically gave him an engraved \r\ninvitation into my life. ",
        "Karen: He's a priest. You somehow thought he was immune. ",
        "Eve: That's what I kept telling myself. ",
        "[Pager beeps] ",
        "Karen: It's the ER. Listen, try not to torture yourself. Just recognize what \r\nhappened and move on. That's the best any of us could do. I'll see you later.\r\n",
        "Eve: All right. ",
        "[Door opens and closes] ",

        "Rafe: Lucy is clearly very brave, like her ancestors. And very strong-willed.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yes, but these aren't reasonable people we're dealing with here, are \r\nthey? They have dungeons! They have \"I love vampire\" stickers on their bumpers, \r\nand killing people like me is a sport to them. ",
        "Rafe: I'm concerned about Lucy, too, but from what I've seen, she can handle \r\nherself. ",
        "Kevin: All well said, but you know what? You don't know Lucy. Now, she's not \r\nonly concerned about our necks, she's concerned about my daughter and what could \r\nhappen to her. The thing is, well intentioned or not, Lucy has an absolute \r\ngenius for making a bad situation worse. ",
        "",
        "James: If you've come to beg for your life, save us both. ",
        "Lucy: No, actually, I haven't. I have a proposition for you. Do you think you \r\ncould handle the truth? ",
        "James: Handle the truth? I'm listening. ",
        "Lucy: I came to Transylvania hoping and dreaming and thinking maybe perhaps \r\nI'd discover I was related to vampires. I've read every book, every magazine, \r\nevery article everywhere. ",
        "James: Yes, I understand the letdown. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, you're a part of that letdown. When you started \r\nspeaking about the vampire way of life, all the mastery of emotions and all that \r\npower -- ",
        "James: Amazing. Go on. ",
        "Lucy: I found it quite amazing. Actually, frankly, it -- it was thrilling.\r\n",
        "James: Tell me why you should live. ",

        "Jamal: Ok. ",

        "Alison: When you woke up in that coffin, what did you do? Well, besides, you \r\nknow, freak out. ",
        "Jack: All -- all I remember is following an instinct. It's like it was -- it's \r\nlike it was calling me. ",
        "Alison: Well, what was it like? ",
        "Jack: Come on, Jack, think. It was like I was unconscious and I was standing \r\noutside of my body, watching. ",
        "Jamal: And then you end up -- ended up here. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Why? ",

        "Jamal: Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I remember reading something in \r\nthose vampire books, ok? It says -- it says when a vampire -- sometimes when \r\nthey're reborn, they're driven to the person that they love, the place where \r\nthey knew true happiness in life. ",
        "Alison: Then -- then Livvie will come and find you. ",

        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Jack: Because I thought Caleb was dead. I mean, she was going to be safe, and \r\nso I told her I didn't want anything to do with her anymore. ",
        "Alison: Because you were going to go off to die. My God, Jack. You broke \r\nLivvie's heart to keep her safe. ",
