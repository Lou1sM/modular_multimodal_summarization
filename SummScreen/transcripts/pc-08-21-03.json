        "Caleb considers replacing Ricky and Reese, neither of whom can be found. Lucy becomes optimistic when Kevin claims to have felt pain in his left arm, but Kevin doesn't feel anything during Ian's examination. When he lashes out at Lucy, Ian sends her out for some air and refuses to let Kevin take out his anger on her. At this, Kevin reminds Ian of the many reasons he has to be angry, including the fact that his wife is making love to another man. Ian informs him that Lucy is no longer his wife. Jack's state of undress embarrasses Olivia, who offers to come back later. Jack insists that she stay and go through the things she left behind. Despite Rafe's best attempts to talk her out of it, Alison insists on being the bait they need to get the ring. While talking to Lucy, Rafe realizes that the ring is responsible for both Kevin's abrupt change of heart and his paralysis. When Jamal goes to pick Imani up for their date, he becomes alarmed. Kicking the door in, he finds that the room is a wreck. Imani is nowhere in sight, and there are some strange scratch marks on the sill by the open window. Alison visits Caleb to apologize for judging him, but he accuses her of making another attempt to get his ring. Denying any such thing, she turns to leave, and Caleb makes an apology of his own. Lucy is stunned to think that Christina's wish is responsible for paralyzing Kevin. She wonders whether the ring could be used for good, but Rafe reminds her that it belongs to the evil Caleb. While going through her things nostalgically with Jack, Olivia lets her guard down with her old lover. Caleb and Alison shake hands in friendship."

        "Imani: So I'll meet you at the pizza shack.",
        "Jamal: No. I'm going to take you someplace that really shows you how special I think you are.",
        "Imani: Oh, Jamal, you do that just about every time we're together.",
        "[Jamal sighs]",
        "Jamal: All right, Miss Imani, here I come.",

        "Lucy: Kevin, are you ok?",
        "Kevin: I'm fine, I'm fine. Please, just don't touch me.",
        "Ian: What happened?",
        "Kevin: I -- I felt a pain. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: You felt a pain? What -- what do we do?",
        "Kevin: Nothing. I'm fine. It's gone now. Please.",
        "Ian: Well, wait. Where's the pain?",
        "Kevin: It's in my left arm.",
        "Lucy: Well, if he feels pain, doesn't that mean something? Can you feel Ian touching you?",
        "Kevin: No.",
        "Lucy: Let me try. Here, come here.",
        "Kevin: Look, please, Lucy -- will you just leave me alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: That's good, that's good, I like that. I tell you what -- you tell Ricky and you tell Reese when you find them they are easily replaceable. Amateurs. Ugh. I'll tell you, man, these kids.",
        "Caleb: Olivia, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Ooh -- oops.",
        "Jack: I see that you used your key.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah. I just came by to check out your stuff. I mean to get my stuff that you packed up that you said you had here. Listen, if now is not a good time, if it's a bad time, I will --",
        "Jack: No, it's -- Livvie, it's not a bad time.",
        "Livvie: Really?",
        "Jack: Brings back old memories, huh?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you and the river, us meeting, uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Jack: I see that you remembered. I'm touched.",
        "Livvie: I don't think so.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm going to go get dressed. Go ahead and have a seat. No, hey, look, you're here. You might as well stay, ok? Have a seat. I'll bring you a beer.",
        "Livvie: Ok. All right, sure. A few minutes wouldn't hurt, I guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I'm not going to discuss this.",
        "Alison: You're right. We're not going to discuss this anymore. I'm just going to go straight to Livvie. I'm going to rattle her cage so badly that she will do anything to get that ring.",
        "Rafe: And if Livvie perceives you as a big enough threat to her and the big bat, what's she going to do then? She's going to want to eliminate the problem altogether. That means you.",
        "Alison: Ok -- ok, look, when you first came up with this assignment, this whole, you know, \"rattle Livvie\" assignment, didn't you originally give it to Jack?",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Right, and what was the first thing that Jack did? He threw my name into it because he knew that that would upset her --",
        "Rafe: That's because he wasn't thinking.",
        "Alison: No, but I think that he really was thinking. He knows just like you and I both know that I am the one person who can get to Livvie. I can make this plan work.",
        "Rafe: I'm not going to throw you into this. I'm not going to use you as bait. You're not s slayer. You didn't choose this life.",
        "Alison: But I did choose you. Rafe. Caleb and Livvie have hurt everyone that I love. This battle is just as much mine as it is yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Take it easy, Collins. We're only trying to help.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I --",
        "Kevin: Would you please, Lucy? Just leave me alone, please.",
        "Ian: Why don't you get some air, Lucy? I'll finish the examination.",
        "Lucy: All right.",
        "Ian: Lucy's right. The pain's a good sign.",
        "Kevin: I'd love to get up and walk out of here, but only one of us is capable of that, which puts me in a bad position because I have to beg you to respect my wishes. You get the irony here?",
        "Ian: Yeah, no, I get it. I'll leave you. Maybe I should tell you something first. You're angry, and I understand that. But I will not allow you to take it out on Lucy.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'm angry. I'm angry that I was just getting my life together and then this changed all that in the blink of an eye. I'm angry that my little girl had to see it, and now it'll probably take her longer to get over it than me! And I'm angry that I ever let myself be talked into coming here, which brings me to the most overwhelming anger of all, which means I get to sit here helpless while you're upstairs making love to my wife!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Who thinks about fighting Caleb 24 hours a day? Not me. That's kind of you. I mean, it's all you can think about. And Jack -- I mean, he's willing to go another round with Livvie, even after all the things that she's done to him. He's going to try and manipulate her to get the ring.",
        "Rafe: Well, he's the only one that she can trust right now.",
        "Alison: I know, but everybody has their purpose in this. I mean, Lucy does, Jamal does, Jack does, you do. It's not like I really want to put myself in harm's way, but I feel like I'm the piece of the puzzle that can make this thing work. So why can't I do my part?",
        "Rafe: Because! You're the woman I love. You're the person that I'm supposed to protect above all others.",
        "Alison: I know, but am I your partner?",
        "Rafe: Yes.",
        "Alison: I think sometimes you forget who I am and who we are. We're both very strong individuals, but together we're invincible.",
        "Rafe: Hmm. I hate this.",
        "Alison: I know you do.",
        "Rafe: So, ok. Tell me what it is you want to do exactly.",
        "Alison: Ok. All I really have to do is go talk to Caleb, right, flash some smile, and Livvie's twisted mind will do the rest. She will take care of it.",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right. But just know that I'm going to keep an eye on you, and if anything that's remotely dangerous --",
        "Alison: I know, I know, I know. You got my back. You always do.",
        "Rafe: Yes. Come here.",
        "Lucy: Hey, you two. Glad to see you guys.",
        "Alison: Hey, Lucy.",
        "Rafe: Hey.",
        "Alison: How is Kevin? He's not worse, is he?",
        "Lucy: No, no, he's not worse. He's really not better, though.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Lucy, I'm so sorry. Is there anything else that we can do?",
        "Lucy: No, no, you've done plenty. Thanks. I just -- oh, I needed to get out for a few minutes, you know, just get some fresh air.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I bet you did. I'm sure you guys have some things that you could probably talk about, and I have some errands that I could go run.",
        "Rafe: Hey --",
        "Alison: I already know what you're going to say, and, yes, yes, I will, ok?",
        "Rafe: Good.",
        "Alison: Love you.",
        "Lucy: That -- you don't want to translate any of that, probably? Probably not, no.",
        "Rafe: I don't know if I can.",
        "Lucy: Ok, good.",
        "Rafe: So, what's wrong?",
        "Lucy: I really thought Kevin moving in was going to be this great idea, for Christina and for Kevin and -- get him better and -- but it's just turned all our lives upside down. I can't believe Ian has to deal with Kevin recovering and -- you know, he was on the right track, though. Kevin's life was getting better. He had turned his life around. What is that thing about be careful what you wish for?",
        "Rafe: What'd you say?",
        "Lucy: You know, I wanted so badly that old, horrible Kevin Collins -- I don't know what he'd become -- to turn back to the old doc, you know, the nice man, and I guess I wished, and look what happened.",
        "Rafe: You know, Luce, you know what? I think it's all starting to make sense.",
        "Rafe: Ok, so it's not something you just thought about, right? I mean, you wished for Kevin to change, right? Right?",
        "Lucy: Well -- yeah. Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Rafe: Ok, when?",
        "Lucy: Why are you doing this? Why are you asking me all of this?",
        "Rafe: You were with Jamal, weren't you?",
        "Lucy: Oh -- yeah, I was with Jamal. Now you're really scaring me.",
        "Rafe: Come here.",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Rafe: Sit down.",
        "Lucy: Ok, what?",
        "Rafe: I think I figured out why Caleb's willing to move mountains to get that ring back. You see, the ring -- it's so dangerous. It makes wishes come true.",
        "Lucy: Wow.",
        "Rafe: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Wow.",
        "Rafe: It did for Jack, it did for Jamal, now it's doing it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Are you in there? I got everything all ready for you. Everything's all set.",
        "[Heavy breathing]",
        "Jamal: Imani, you ok in there?",
        "[Noise]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Here's that shirt I shrunk in the wash. Why did I ever even keep this, anyway?",
        "Jack: Because you looked hot in it.",
        "Livvie: Really?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Livvie: Thanks. Would you look at this.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it's the four of us. It's when we came back from sailing. I remember that. Times have changed. Look at that light, though, this picture -- imagine that.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Jack: Here I am trying to play photographer, and look at these pictures you shot. Look, they're awesome.",
        "Livvie: Ugh. Please, you are so much better than I am.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. No, no, give yourself some credit. These pictures are really good.",
        "Livvie: Well, we were happy. It was -- it was easy. Well, we did have some really good times, didn't we?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'll never forget them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Caleb: For someone who claims to hate me, it's funny how many times you show up at my door.",
        "Alison: Can I come in?",
        "Caleb: I don't have much time.",
        "Alison: Look, I was thinking about everything that I said to you, and it didn't come out the way that I wanted it to.",
        "Caleb: Uh-huh. What, what is this? Is this part two of your continuing lecture on how Olivia and I are going to live miserable lives for eternity?",
        "Alison: I will be the first one to admit that I really don't get you two. I don't understand you and Livvie at all, but it's obvious that you guys love each other, and anybody who sees you two together can see that. But, you know, I started to judge you a little bit, and I hate it when people judge what Rafe and I have together, and I was doing that to you, and I just wanted to tell you I was sorry.",
        "Caleb: Oh, well, this epiphany is all very moving and all, but what you think of us doesn't matter.",
        "Alison: I'm trying to apologize to you. You know, the whole ring business that you did here was really unnecessary, and frankly, it was rude. And you sort of disappointed me.",
        "Caleb: Disappointed you?",
        "Alison: I sort of started to respect you, and I thought that you were starting to respect me, too, and then when you pulled that, you really hurt my feelings.",
        "Caleb: No. No, I don't think you're hurt at all.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: I think this is another lame attempt to try to get my ring from me.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. It was actually an attempt to apologize to you, but I can see that that means nothing to you, saying I'm sorry, which it would mean something to me, but that's fine.",
        "Caleb: Alison --",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Caleb: Maybe it does mean something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Oh, I can't believe this. I mean, I can believe it because I couldn't believe that Kevin would make such an amazing turnaround in his life. I mean, people just don't change on a dime like that. It wasn't some strange coincidence. I just felt it. But wait a minute. Does that mean -- does this mean that the wishes aren't real or what's happened isn't real, or could the wishes just fade away somehow?",
        "Rafe: I don't think so.",
        "Lucy: Then maybe we could use the ring to heal Kevin. Think of all that power!",
        "Rafe: Ok, there's more.",
        "Lucy: Oh, tell me. I want to hear it. What?",
        "Rafe: Remember I was just telling you that Jamal threw the ring in the river?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you said he just tossed it in the river without really thinking.",
        "Rafe: Right. Well, it seems that Christina found it.",
        "Lucy: My Christina?",
        "Rafe: And she wished for something, something she wanted really badly.",
        "Lucy: What could she possibly have wished for that she wanted so badly? I mean, I try and give -- she wished that her daddy and mommy could live together again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: You've said your piece. Now may I say mine?",
        "Kevin: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Ian: Yeah. First off, Lucy is not your wife. She's your ex-wife. And there's a reason for that. And I'm not fooling myself. She would have waited for you for always. But you hurt her and you kept hurting her until she had no choice.",
        "Kevin: And there you were with open arms.",
        "Ian: You think you're the only one that's angry? I'm starting a life with Lucy, trying to build a home together, and never in a million years did I think you'd be part of that. But here you are, living with us. And I understand it's what's best for Christina, it's what's best for Lucy.",
        "Kevin: I'm not convinced it's what's best for me.",
        "Ian: Lucy is going to be a part of your recovery process. She's not good sitting on the sidelines. And she still cares about you an awful lot. Personally, I don't see it, but that's the kind of woman she is, and that's what made both of us fall in love with her.",
        "Kevin: And believe it or not, I know you're trying to help me, and if I don't seem appropriately grateful, it's because every time I look at Lucy I see the woman I've been in love with practically since the first day I stepped into this town. And when I look at you, I just see the man who's sleeping with her.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Ian: We all have our burdens. Call me if you need me.",
        "Kevin: So, Lucy, what did your universe have in mind when it pulled this one on us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy's voice: Oh, Rafe, you got to be wrong. Kevin's living with us because of the accident.",
        "Rafe's voice: No, Kevin's living with you because Christina wished it before the accident happened.",
        "Lucy's voice: What are you saying? She would never, ever want him to be hurt.",
        "Rafe's voice: No, no, of course not. She loves him. But you and Ian had been happy. And Kevin gave you the divorce. It would take something extraordinary to make his moving in even a possibility.",
        "Lucy's voice: So Christina got her wish.",
        "Rafe's voice: And Kevin may never walk again. It gives people what they want, but there's no thought to the consequences.",
        "Lucy's voice: I see. It's like you're messing with the universe. I guess there's a plan for all of us, and as soon as you change the path we're on, there's a ripple effect, repercussions.",
        "Rafe's voice: Exactly. It messes with everyone's destiny. With each of these stupid, harmless little wishes, someone has gotten hurt, or will. Jack had the ring for just a few days, but he made a wish. He wished for Reese to give him some space. She did. She dumped him. You know where that leaves him?",
        "Lucy's voice: Alone again and vulnerable.",
        "Rafe's voice: Yeah, well, Jack doesn't do alone real well, so he got his wish, and now he's probably out there already looking for trouble.",
        "Lucy's voice: I can't believe there isn't a way to use the ring for good.",
        "Rafe's voice: Come on, it belongs to Caleb, Lucy. How good can it be? And its power is just beginning to be felt. Even with the wishes that have already been made, who knows where they'll lead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Look, Alison, I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Wow. Caleb Morley apologizing. That's got to be a first.",
        "Caleb: Maybe the first time I actually meant it.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Caleb: Well, when you came to get my ring, I could have just told you you were out of your mind and sent you on your way. But instead, I sort of put you through hoops, and -- well, for that, I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Apology accepted.",
        "Caleb: That was easy.",
        "Alison: Yeah -- no, not really. But -- but I do accept.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. You know, I've -- I've known a few women in my time.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm sure you have. Sorry.",
        "Caleb: But I've never -- I've never had this, just -- just being able to -- I don't know, just talk the way we do.",
        "Alison: So you've never actually had a woman as just a friend?",
        "Caleb: Nope.",
        "Alison: Well, that's a surprise.",
        "Caleb: So that's what this is -- we're friends?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I -- I guess so. Friends. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: The Gift.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jamal: Imani's in trouble, dude. She's somebody that I care about.",
        "Rafe: It's time for you to make believe that you never met this girl.",
        "Livvie: What you want to do right now you don't have the guts to do inside.",
        "Jack: Is that right?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's right."
