        "Ian: Lambert, what are you still doing here? ",
        "Eve: Oh, just catching up on some paperwork. ",
        "Ian: Uh-huh. Why don't you go home and put your feet up?",
        "Eve: Yes, I'm going to do that soon. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Good. You all right? ",
        "Eve: I'm fine. Everything's fine. ",
        "Colleen: Ian? ",
        "Ian: Yeah? ",
        "Colleen: Radiology is ready to go over those x-rays. ",
        "Ian: All right. Hey. ",
        "Eve: Hmm? ",
        "Ian: Go home like I told you, all right? ",
        "Eve: Yes, sir. ",
        "Ian: Bye. ",
        "Eve: Bye. ",
        "Colleen: It's sweet of him to be so concerned. ",
        "Eve: Yes, I am very lucky to have him. ",
        "Karen: Earth to Eve. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Hey. ",
        "Karen: Hi. Looked like you were a million miles away there. What's up? ",
        "Eve: I was just thinking about what we were talking about earlier. ",
        "Karen: Oh. Michael? Inadvertently sending him mixed signals? ",
        "Eve: How stupid am I? ",
        "Karen: You didn't mean to do it. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but still, that is so horrible, after everything he did to protect \r\nme, my baby, and everyone. He destroyed his brother, Caleb, and now he is left \r\nto deal with that all by himself. ",
        "Karen: Which he will. Come on, Eve, you got to let this go. Ok, listen, if \r\nit'll make you feel better, why don't you give him a call? ",
        "Eve: I have, several times. ",
        "Karen: And? ",
        "Eve: He hasn't returned my phone calls, I haven't heard from him -- nothing.\r\n",
        "Karen: Well, maybe he's busy. ",
        "Eve: No. I know this silence means more somehow. ",
        "Karen: So what are you saying? ",
        "Eve: I'm afraid, Karen. I'm afraid of what he may have done to himself. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, call Livvie. Warn her that Caleb's alive. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Kevin: All right, old man, I want to know everything you know about that \r\nmonster. ",
        "Rafe: And don't leave anything out. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, nothing. I can't get through. ",
        "Kevin: Of course you can't get through on these phones. Lucy, I should've \r\nknown that Michael was lying. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not your fault. All of us believed that he had destroyed \r\nCaleb. We thought he was telling the truth. ",
        "[James chuckles] ",
        "Kevin: You think this is funny? ",
        "James: I'm not at liberty to let you in on the joke. ",
        "Kevin: You knew Michael wouldn't kill his brother, didn't you? ",
        "Rafe: Because there's something that's protecting him, something very \r\npowerful. ",
        "Lucy: The talisman. ",
        "Kevin: The talisman, but what is it? What is keeping that bastard alive? Ok. \r\nYou're going to tell me or I swear to God -- ",
        "James: Go ahead. Kill, torture, do what you want. I shall never betray the \r\nmaster. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hear me, Caleb? I said you won. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, Jack. I know I won. ",
        "Jack: You won even more. ",
        "Caleb: Really? Well, I'm always interested in hearing about my victories. ",
        "Jack: You wanted me to cross over, to be one of you. I'm ready to do that \r\nnow. I'm ready to join you, right here. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, why? ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, Jack, why, indeed? Why would you want to inflict the torture of \r\nwatching the woman you love with me? ",
        "Jack: Because the torture of never seeing her again is far worse. ",
        "Livvie: You know what? I really don't care why you want to cross over, Jack. \r\nI just want you to go. ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Livvie: Now. Jack, please? ",
        "Jack: I'm not going anywhere, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: What is your problem? What are you trying to prove, Jack? Just get \r\nout of here. ",
        "Caleb: Save your breath, Olivia. Our friend Jack here is -- is obviously \r\ndetermined to stay, and I think I know why. ",
        "Jack: I told you why. ",
        "Caleb: Our hero has a plan. Some sort of secret agenda that he may just live \r\nto regret. ",
        "",
        "Karen: Eve, you don't think he -- Michael's a priest. He wouldn't harm \r\nhimself. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, but he's not supposed to be able to fall in love with me or kill \r\nanyone, either, but he did. And now he's not returning my phone calls, I can't \r\nget in touch with him. So either he is completely withdrawn or -- ",
        "Karen: Or maybe he just needs some space. ",
        "Eve: No, I don't think that's it. I think it's more than that. ",
        "Karen: I know Michael was upset. ",
        "Eve: \"Upset?\" He was traumatized. And can you blame him? Who wouldn't be? ",
        "Karen: Eve, Caleb was evil. He had to be destroyed. You know that. ",
        "Eve: I know that. And believe me, I thank God every day that he was and my \r\nbaby is safe. And as much as Michael knew it was the right thing to do, I think \r\na part of him died alongside his brother. And now there's -- I just have to make \r\nthis right somehow. ",
        "Karen: Well, making it right is not something you or anybody else can do for \r\nMichael. He needs to make peace with this himself. ",
        "Eve: No. What he needs right now is a friend. God, why did I have to ruin \r\nthis? ",
        "Karen: Well, wait, wait, wait a minute. Where are you going? ",
        "Eve: I'm going to go find him. ",
        "Karen: Where? ",
        "Eve: The monastery. ",
        "Karen: But Ian -- ",
        "Eve: Listen, Ian wants this to be over and done with, but I can't just drop \r\nit until I know Michael is safe. ",
        "Karen: Eve, I -- ",
        "Eve: Please, Karen, don't argue with me. I'll be fine. ",
        "Karen: Just promise me you'll be careful. ",
        "Eve: I will be careful. I mean, what's there to be afraid of? Caleb is dead.\r\n",
        "Karen: Right. You're right. Ok, go do what you have to do. ",
        "Eve: Ok, thanks. ",
        "Ian: Hey, Karen, you look nice. ",
        "Karen: Ian. Hey, I -- I was just talking to your lovely wife. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? Well, I hope she's on her way home then. ",
        "Karen: Well, um, actually, she had to run and errand. ",
        "Ian: An errand? What kind of errand? She's going to go -- ",
        "Karen: I don't know, but she said it'll be fast and that she loves you very \r\nmuch and she'll see you later -- soon. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. Is everything all right? ",
        "Karen: Yeah, of course. Why would you say -- ",
        "Orderly: Dr. Thornhart? There's trouble in the lockup rooms. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Orderly: Well, somebody's trying to get in. ",
        "Karen: In? ",
        "Ian: I'll take care of it. ",
        "",
        "Jack: You're wrong, Caleb. I don't have a plan other than accepting the \r\nobvious. We both know that someday I was going to turn anyway. ",
        "Caleb: So blas\u00e9 for someone who has fought me at every turn, who's repeatedly \r\nrisked his life to keep me away from Olivia. ",
        "Jack: I know that I can't fight you. You've won. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, and so I'm to believe you've been broken? And like a docile little \r\nlamb you've returned here and you'll do whatever I say? ",
        "Jack: Yes, as long as I can stay and be a part of the coven. ",
        "Caleb: And tell me again why you want to be so near your lost love now that \r\nshe's married to me? That's right, Jack. We're married now, in every sense of \r\nthe word. And I get the feeling my wife doesn't want you around here anymore.\r\n",
        "Jack: I know that Livvie will never be mine. But I still love her. The bottom \r\nline is I can't live without her in my world. ",
        "Caleb: How very noble of you. ",
        "Jack: It has nothing to do with being noble. It's acceptance. Accepting that \r\nthe only way to be near her is to serve you in whatever way you want. ",
        "Caleb: Hmm. Well, what do you say we put that to the test right here, right \r\nnow? ",
        "Jack: No problem. ",
        "Caleb: Great. Here's the deal -- I think I'd like to make love to my bride, \r\nand I want you to watch, Jack. ",
        "",
        "Priest: Dr. Thornhart. ",
        "Ian: Not right now, Father. Not right now. ",
        "Priest: Yes, the young gentleman told me. He said you were coming to stop me.\r\n",
        "Ian: Are you the one trying -- ",
        "Priest: I demand to see Emilio and Gabriela this instant. ",
        "Ian: Who are you? ",
        "Priest: Father Vicente, parish priest to the Garzas all their lives. I'm \r\ncertain they'd want to see me. ",
        "Ian: I'm sure they would, but --",
        "Father Vicente: and don't give me this \"rare, contagious disease\" bunch of \r\nbull. I'm not buying it. ",
        "Ian: I'm not free to discuss my patients' condition, ok? ",
        "Father Vicente: I'm not leaving until I get in to see them. Their family's \r\nworried sick. They want answers and I mean to get them or die trying. Now, you \r\ntell me what's going on in there. ",
        "Ian: Father, it's a medical situation and the only people allowed in there \r\nare their caretakers and caregivers, ok? ",
        "Father Vicente: Then I'm qualified. I'm here to help. ",
        "Ian: There's nothing you can do, believe me. ",
        "Father Vicente: You doctors think you're the only ones qualified to ease a \r\nperson's suffering. ",
        "Ian: It's what we're trained for. ",
        "Father Vicente: If the trouble were just physical. But I have a feeling it's \r\nnot. That's why you haven't been able to help. Look, I feel strongly in the \r\nforces of good, but I'm aware evil exists. ",
        "Ian: You have no idea. ",
        "Father Vicente: Ian, talk to me. ",
        "Ian: All right. What if I told you that Emilio and Gabby were attacked by \r\nsomething -- something very powerful, very dark? ",
        "Father Vicente: A vampire? ",
        "Ian: You believe in vampires, father? ",
        "Father Vicente: Was anyone else harmed? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. A young man by the name of Jack Ramsey and my wife and unborn \r\nchild. This vampire threatened them, and the brother, who's in your line of \r\nbusiness, intervened. ",
        "Father Vicente: The vampire's brother is a priest? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. And he gave a necklace to my wife to protect her and the baby from \r\nthe brother. ",
        "Father Vicente: That's odd. ",
        "Ian: Odd how? ",
        "Father Vicente: This necklace, this amulet -- it sounds like a pagan talisman \r\nof some sort. It's unusual for a priest to use that kind of thing. It's highly \r\nunusual. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Don't tempt me, James. There's nothing I'd love more than to break \r\nyour neck. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, you know, we can't quite kill him -- not yet. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know -- not until we have the answers we need. ",
        "James: You know what you know. ",
        "Kevin: Well, we can certainly make him uncomfortable. We can just tear this \r\nplace apart, brick by brick. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, good idea. You know, there's probably a clue around here somewhere \r\n-- lots and lots of hidden family secrets, eh, James? ",
        "Rafe: Maybe it would be easier if I got into his ugly little mind right now \r\nand find out the answers. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, right, cousin. We can do that, can't we? You know, he does have \r\nthat power as a bona fide vampire slayer. We can do that right now. ",
        "James: Well, do your stuff, laddie. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I do see a bead of sweat trickling down his eyebrow there. ",
        "Kevin: You know what occurs to me? It's not enough that we destroy just \r\nCaleb. Michael's supposed to be a man of God, but he let Caleb live, even though \r\nhe must know the secret of how to destroy him. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, you're right. Michael has to have the answer, too. ",
        "Kevin: So if I have to beat it out of him, priest or no priest, I will. ",
        "James: Michael will always protect his brother. Always. ",
        "Kevin: Well, then you leave us no choice. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I guess some people like it. ",
        "James: Why are you doing this? ",
        "Kevin: I told you I will tear this place apart! ",
        "Lucy: Doc! Doc! ",

        "Caleb: So what do you say, Jack? You can pull up that chair, enjoy the show.\r\n",
        "Livvie: No, Caleb. Please don't do this. ",
        "Caleb: You're protecting him. ",
        "Livvie: No. It's just what you and I have is our own and I don't want to \r\nshare that with anyone else. Please? Listen to me. The more Jack sees my love \r\nfor you, the more determined he'll be to change me back to the way I was -- \r\nbefore I met you, Caleb, before we fell in love. ",
        "Jack: No. You're wrong, Livvie. I know I'm too late. All I want is to be a \r\npart of your life in some small way. ",
        "Caleb: Well, this is all very interesting. However, Olivia's first -- how \r\nshould we say -- rite of passage is to make her first kill. And despite your \r\ndeclarations, I think you're here to keep that from happening. ",
        "Jack: No, you're wrong. ",
        "Caleb: You assume you'll be given the job keeping her, at least in your mind, \r\npure, all the while growing stronger with every kill you make -- maybe strong \r\nenough to someday take me on. Well, that's not going to happen, Jack, because \r\nOlivia's first kill is going to be you. ",
        "",
        "Caleb: You know what you have to do, my love. And I know you'll do it well. \r\nDo it. Kill Jack. ",

        "Caleb: That's a good girl. ",
        "Livvie: Go. Jack, go. ",
        "Caleb: Do it now, Olivia. ",

        "Jack: Face it, Caleb -- you may have Livvie now, but you can't make her stop \r\nloving me. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb, listen to me -- it doesn't matter what I feel for Jack. I \r\nchose you, to be with you for all eternity. My God, Caleb, I died for you. ",

        "",
        "Ian: I wish there was something you could do to help her, but Gabby has \r\nembraced the evil force inside of her. ",
        "Father Vicente: Then maybe it would help to let her know there's a much \r\nstronger force pulling her back. ",
        "Ian: I suppose it's worth a try. ",
