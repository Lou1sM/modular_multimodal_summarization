        "Gabriela: Why did you bring him, Ian? ",
        "Father Vicente: Gabriela, my sweet child. ",
        "Gabriela: Just go. ",
        "Father Vicente: I've known you your entire life. I won't turn my back on you \r\nnow. ",
        "Gabriela: I don't want your help. ",
        "Father Vicente: You can find your soul again. I know you can. ",
        "Gabriela: It's too late. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Come on, live you worthless son of a -- ",
        "Rafe: Dr. Collins, he's dead. There's nothing you can do. ",
        "Kevin: Damn it! Now we'll never know what the talisman is. ",
        "Lucy: No. There has to be a clue in this house somewhere. There has to be.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Caleb's family has lived in this mansion hundreds of years. The secret \r\nof the talisman should be here. ",
        "Kevin: Then we're going to tear this place apart till we find it. That \r\nmonster is not going to get my daughter! ",
        "Lucy: All right. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Caleb's gone, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: No. ",
        "Jack: Yes. Your love for me drove him away. ",
        "Livvie: No, he'll come back for me. I'm his bride. I belong to him. ",
        "Jack: No, you you're your own person. You proved that. He ordered you to kill \r\nme and you couldn't. Our love is stronger than any power Caleb has over you. ",
        "Livvie: I belong to Caleb. I'm married to him. ",
        "Jack: No, it's not a real marriage. It's an illusion. It's a fantasy, it's \r\nhis fantasy. It's not yours. ",
        "Livvie: No. Jack, he'll come back for me. Caleb is not gone. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Michael, are you all right? ",
        "Michael: I've been better. ",
        "Eve: You've been here praying the whole time? Well, I was worried about you. \r\nI called -- I called a million times and you didn't answer. ",
        "Michael: I'm sorry if I concerned you. ",
        "Eve: No, I understand. I mean, I realize you want to be alone. You probably \r\nfeel guilty about Caleb. ",
        "Michael: I'll find a way to deal with that, Eve. I'll look to God. ",
        "Eve: Well, I feel responsible, too. ",
        "Michael: You're not. ",
        "Eve: Yes, I feel responsible. You sacrificed the person that you have been \r\nprotecting for years -- your twin brother who you loved very much -- for me and \r\nmy child. ",
        "Michael: What happened between me and my brother was inevitable. ",
        "Eve: No. It's because you have feelings for me. That's what started all of \r\nthis. ",
        "Michael: Eve, go home. Go back to your husband, please. ",
        "Eve: Michael, we have to talk about this. ",
        "Michael: No, you need to go now, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Why? ",
        "Michael: Because I'm worried about what will happen to you if you stay. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Wherever Caleb is, you're strong enough to fight him. ",
        "Livvie: I don't want to fight him. I want to be with him. ",
        "Jack: No, you're just repeating the words he's put in your head. Livvie, \r\nlisten to me. He wants to control you, possess you, and that's not real love. \r\nAnd if you love him that way, you would do whatever he said. ",
        "Livvie: I do -- and I would. ",
        "Jack: He asked you to kill me and you wouldn't. ",
        "Livvie: No, it's different. ",
        "Jack: No. No, it's not. If you didn't care about me, and all you cared about \r\nwas a life Caleb had to offer you, then you would do whatever you had to do to \r\nget that. But our love is stronger than his illusion, and he saw it. He saw our \r\nconnection. ",
        "Livvie: Our connection? ",
        "Jack: Real love. That's what we have, and it's the only one thing that can \r\nbeat him. ",
        "Livvie: But you left me. Jack, you said you didn't love me anymore. ",
        "Jack: I lied. I left you because I wanted to keep you safe from me. I thought \r\nCaleb was dead and that I was the only one who would be able to hurt you. But I \r\nnever stopped loving you, Livvie, and I never will. And I'm sorry that I wasn't \r\nthere for you when you needed me most. ",
        "Livvie: No, it doesn't matter. I would've chosen Caleb anyway. He's my \r\ndestiny. He's going to give me the life I've always wanted. ",
        "Jack: What, a life where he'll never leave you or hurt you? Livvie, he just \r\ndid. He doesn't trust your feelings. He can't stand to see them. He only wants \r\nyou to know what he's put in your head, but you know what you feel. ",
        "Livvie: No, it doesn't matter. ",
        "Jack: It does matter. Love is the only thing that matters. What do you feel \r\nin your heart when there are no other voices or sounds around? ",
        "",
        "Eve: What do you mean what could happen to me? It's just you and me here. ",
        "Michael: I just can't have you around here. ",
        "Eve: Because you care for me. ",
        "Michael: Because I can't care for you. You're married and you're carrying the \r\nchild of the man you love. And I'm a priest. I promised to devote my life to \r\nGod, to countering Caleb's evil acts. ",
        "Eve: And you have. Michael, you have. Don't ever doubt that. And don't ever \r\ndoubt your calling or what you've done for people, what you've done for me. ",
        "Michael: I have had thoughts about you that I shouldn't have. ",
        "Eve: No -- ",
        "Michael: God forgive me. ",
        "Eve: Michael, it's -- it's not the thoughts, ok? It's whether or not you act \r\non them. ",
        "Michael: No, not in my world. My feelings for you have clouded everything, \r\nEve. And as a result, I have put you and others in danger, and for that I am to \r\nblame. ",
        "Eve: I didn't come here for that. I came to tell you that I am not innocent \r\nin all of this. ",
        "Michael: You didn't encourage my feelings. ",
        "Eve: Yes, that's exactly what I did. And I didn't realize I was doing it at \r\nthe time, but I did. I just -- I was so charmed by who you are. I fell in love \r\nwith the goodness in you and who you are in this world. ",
        "Michael: Who I am? ",
        "Eve: I turned to you for help in ways that I shouldn't have. ",
        "Michael: You should've felt safe to come to me. I shouldn't have \r\nmisinterpreted what you -- ",
        "Eve: But you didn't. Feelings like that are real. No, it's not the same kind \r\nof love that I feel for Ian, but I do love you for the person you are, and I'm \r\nso glad to have you in my life. I'm just sorry I confused things. It wasn't just \r\nyou. It was me, too. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Father -- ",
        "Father Vicente: Give yourself over to God. Let him see you through. Pray with \r\nme, Gabriela. ",
        "Gabriela: Tell him what I am. Tell him what I've done. ",
        "Ian: I have. ",
        "Father Vicente: It wasn't you who committed those acts. It was the forces \r\naround you. ",
        "Gabriela: It was me. I wanted to. ",
        "Father Vicente: It wasn't your soul. Your body and mind have been controlled, \r\nbut you can fight it. ",
        "Ian: The father's known you since you were an infant. He's watched you grow \r\ninto a beautiful woman. Let him try to bring you back. That is what you want, is \r\nit not? ",
        "",
        "Michael: Thank you for opening your heart. You don't know how much that means \r\nto me. ",
        "Eve: You made it easy, Michael. ",
        "Michael: You said you love who I am in this world. No one's ever felt that \r\nway about me. ",
        "Eve: That's because you have devoted your life to helping your brother, \r\nprotecting him, trying to save him. ",
        "Michael: But I couldn't. ",
        "Eve: Well, you have saved me in so many ways I couldn't even begin to thank \r\nyou. ",
        "Michael: You did just as much for me. I'll -- I'll never forget all the \r\nkindness that you've shown me, Eve. But now you really -- you should go. ",
        "Eve: Michael, I don't want to leave you alone. ",
        "Michael: Don't worry about me, Eve. I'm never really alone. ",
        "Eve: Ok. All right, but will you promise to answer your phone from now on?\r\n",
        "Michael: I will. I promise. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Michael: Goodbye, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Goodbye. ",
        "Caleb: Surprise. ",
        "Michael: I was afraid what I was feeling was true. You're alive. ",
        "Caleb: You didn't really think you could destroy me, did you? ",
        "Michael: I thought I had. I thought -- ",
        "Caleb: You thought wrong. And as usual, this Eve's really got you twisted \r\naround, doesn't she? ",
        "Michael: But I couldn't feel you. You were -- ",
        "Caleb: Weak, not gone. Don't overestimate our brotherly bond. ",
        "Michael: I couldn't let you hurt Eve or her child. ",
        "Caleb: Oh. This old record again. Why don't you stop whining about her and \r\njust be a man? ",
        "Michael: A real man doesn't have to make a woman love him. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. You just pray for it, right? And your prayers are always \r\nanswered, huh, Mikey? ",
        "Michael: Eve may not be in love with me, but she sees me and she loves who I \r\nam. ",
        "Caleb: Aw. How sweet. ",
        "Michael: It's what you don't have, Caleb. You create illusions and lies. You \r\nhave to manipulate people into loving you, and then you twist it around and make \r\nit what you want. ",
        "Caleb: Better than having to sacrifice and risk losing the one you love. ",
        "Michael: No, it's not. Because it's not real. Not real like the love Jack and \r\nLivvie have. ",
        "Caleb: Shut up. ",
        "Michael: Or even the love of a friend, like I have with Eve. ",
        "Caleb: I said shut up, Michael! ",
        "Michael: You've never been loved, Caleb. Never. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I'm afraid to love you. You'll only push me away again. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, look, I'm afraid to -- of what I am and what might happen. ",
        "Livvie: Of what we both are and what might happen if we get close again. ",
        "Jack: I think I've had everything wrong. I thought loving you would hurt you. \r\nBut it saved you, and your love saved me. ",
        "Livvie: Pushing each other away is what hurt. ",
        "Jack: And that's what put us in danger. ",
        "Livvie: But you think -- ",
        "Jack: Our love is strong enough to beat Caleb. He saw how real it was. ",
        "Livvie: So then maybe it's strong enough -- ",
        "Jack: And real enough for us to be together. To be close. ",
        "Livvie: And make love. ",
        "Jack: And make love. ",
        "Livvie: I love you, Jack. ",

        "Kevin: This is worse than the needle in a haystack. We don't even know what \r\nwe're looking for. ",
        "Lucy: What -- what is it? What is Caleb's talisman? Doc, the -- the key to it \r\nis here, I can feel it. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, but can you feel where it is? ",
        "Rafe: Hey. I found something around James' neck. ",
        "Lucy: Well, it's a key. Wait a minute. The key to the talisman is a key? No, \r\nRafe, what if it's a key to where the secret is hidden? ",
        "Kevin: But that doesn't get us any closer to where it is. ",
        "Rafe: This mansion's huge. Even if we tried every visible keyhole, it would \r\ntake forever. ",
        "Kevin: And I doubt it's in plain sight. ",
        "Lucy: Doc? What? What is it? ",
        "Kevin: James -- he was trying so hard not to show any emotion because he was \r\nafraid he'd tip us off about the talisman. ",
        "Lucy: True, but then he ended up showing a lot of emotion when he jumped at \r\nyou. ",
        "Kevin: Exactly, and I was standing over there. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, go. Go stand over there and see if anything comes to you. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. All right, I was right here, and I was -- I was tearing things off \r\nthe shelf.",

        "Jack: You ok? ",
        "Livvie: I didn't believe it could happen. ",
        "Jack: I know, but our love is real, and we can fight this together. ",
        "Livvie: I know, but -- ",
        "Jack: But why are you afraid? ",

        "Jack: I know that you're probably scared about Caleb's hold on you. ",
        "Livvie: It's just so hard to fight. I don't know how to get him out of my \r\nhead. ",
        "Jack: By loving each other. And if we trust in that, then I know we can beat \r\nhim. ",

        "Father Vicente: We'll continue this conversation later. ",
        "Gabriela: Why spend so much time on me? ",
        "Father Vicente: Because I love you, and God loves you. ",
        "Gabriela: They don't work. ",
        "Father Vicente: You'd be surprised. ",
        "Ian: Thanks. You're making headway with her. ",
        "Father Vicente: A little at a time, but we've got a long way to go. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. What's next? ",
        "Father Vicente: I need to see Emilio. Is something troubling you, doctor? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. The priest I told you about. The brother to the man who's \r\nresponsible for all this. Well, he told me that he's devoted his life to \r\nfighting evil, yet he's never invoked the power of God the way you just did. ",
        "Father Vicente: Instead he'd used a talisman of some sort to ward off evil.\r\n",
        "Ian: Amulet that he gave to Eve. ",
        "Father Vicente: What you've told me about this priest troubles me. He's not \r\nlike any devout man of the cloth I've ever met. What's his name? I'd like to \r\ntalk to him. ",
        "Ian: Well, I appreciate that. He's father Michael, Michael Morley. He's out \r\nin the monastery -- ",
        "Father Vicente: You mean Michael Morley? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, why? You know him? ",
        "Father Vicente: Yeah. He came to me at the seminary. He said he wanted to \r\nbecome a priest, but he wanted it now. He wasn't willing to wait. ",
        "Ian: Wait, wait -- what are you saying? That he's not really a priest? ",
        "Father Vicente: Yes. ",
        "Ian: I had him checked out. ",
        "Father Vicente: Then you uncovered lies he must've planted. Michael Morley is \r\nno priest. He's -- he's a troubled young man. ",

        "Kevin: So it's where I was standing that freaked James out. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Obviously, you got too close to this. ",

        "Kevin: Lucy, just stay back. ",
        "Lucy: You've go to be kidding me. ",

        "Lucy: Fine. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my goodness. ",

        "Kevin: Yeah -- ",
        "Lucy: Rafe, does that key work anywhere? ",
        "Rafe: At -- here. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Wow. Whoa, Doc, what is it? Like -- like a book of spells, \r\nincantations? ",
        "Kevin: \"Familia sunt omnia.\" Lucy, this is the Morley family tree. ",
        "Lucy: A vampire family album? ",
        "Rafe: Must go back for centuries. ",
        "Kevin: There's names and dates here for every generation of Morleys. ",

        "Caleb: She doesn't love him, and she's coming back to me. ",
        "Michael: \"Back?\" So she did leave you, didn't she? And she ran straight into \r\nthe arms of the one she loves. You can't hurt me. ",
        "Caleb: No. Only Eve can do that. It must kill you knowing you will never have \r\nher. ",
        "Michael: Knowing that she loves and sees the good in me is enough. ",
