        "After waiting all night for Imani to show up, Jamal calls the police, but Imani walks in the door as he's speaking to the desk officer. She tries to put off explaining what happened, but Jamal insists on the truth. Pointing out that the room is a wreck, he asks how she managed to put the scratch marks on the windowsill. Imani denies having done that, but Jamal draws her attention to her torn and bloody fingernails. Imani tells him that she panicked and fled after hearing a noise, which turned out to be a false alarm. Reminding her that he is there for her, Jamal insists that she move into his place for protection. Not seeing any way around it, Imani gets out her suitcase. Rafe tries to put a stop to Jack's involvement in his plan, but Jack refuses to take orders from him. Rafe believes that Jack wants the ring. When Jack calls him on his self-righteous attitude, Rafe punches him in the jaw. Rafe maintains that the ring is dangerous, but Jack believes that the slayer wants it for himself. He tells Rafe off for not seeing how blessed he is. Ricky and Casey return from Atlantic City, and Ricky worries about what Jamal will do to him for taking off with his bike. Reese finds Ricky talking to Casey and tells him off for disappearing on her. She kisses him and tells him that this is what kissing a real girl is like. She wants to spend the day together, but Ricky isn't interested. As Reese sulks about him wasting time on a dead girl, a nearby light breaks. Spooked, Reese decides to take off. Casey laughs. When Kevin apologizes to Lucy for his angry outburst, she quickly accepts his apology and rushes to find Ian. She fills her lover in on what she learned from Rafe, including Christina's innocent wish on Caleb's ring. Stunned, Ian decides to get Kevin out of the house immediately, thinking that it might somehow undo Christina's wish. Lucy reluctantly goes to tell Kevin, but she stops when she hears him singing to Christina, who is asleep in her daddy's lap."

        "Jamal: How could she just disappear? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi. Officer, this is Jamal Woods. I want to file a missing person report. Ok, yeah. Well, this girl I came to pick up for a date, like, a dinner date and everything, and I showed up and she wasn't here and her place was really, really messed up. No, no, of course not, man. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I looked all around town. I did. I looked -- no, I'm serious, the place is a mess. This is not like a normal type of thing. The place is a mess. I'm serious, this is not something --",
        "Imani: Jamal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Bad news. More bad news. Hey. How was your run?",
        "Lucy: Uh -- what?",
        "Kevin: Your jog. How was it?",
        "Lucy: It was great, thank you. I'm sorry, do you need something?",
        "Kevin: No, no, the day nurse is still here.",
        "Lucy: Good, good, I'm glad.",
        "Kevin: Hey, Lucy? The other night, I was in a lot of pain.",
        "Lucy: I -- I realize that. Don't worry, it was nothing.",
        "Kevin: It's not nothing. I was taking all this out on you, and I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. But I completely understand. Now, if you'll just excuse me. Um --",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Lucy: Hey. I really need to talk to you.",
        "Ian: Ok, let me just --",
        "Lucy: No, no, don't \"let me just\" nothing. I need to talk to you right now, because I thought about this all night and I should've told you last night, but I couldn't because I couldn't quite wrap my head around what I need to tell you.",
        "Ian: Slow down, slow down. What is it?",
        "Lucy: It's about Kevin and the real reason he is here in our home. It's not what we thought. In fact, I don't think it's what anybody would have ever thought.",
        "Ian: Wait. What are you talking about? I don't --",
        "Lucy: Last night, remember, you told me to go out and get some air, so I went to the park and I ran into Rafe. And I talked to him for quite a while and he explained to me about Caleb's ring. Caleb's ring can grant wishes.",
        "Ian: Grant what?",
        "Lucy: It grants wishes. I know, I know. Whoever has the ring, the bearer of the ring, whatever they ask for, that wish comes true. And it's great, it sounds wonderful, but there's a catch. No matter if the wish is good or if the wish is for evil, the people involved in the wish -- things go wrong. The ring turns on them. Bad things can happen.",
        "Ian: So who wished for Kevin to live with us?",
        "Lucy: Christina. I don't know how she -- she found the ring, and that's a long story, but she wished for her daddy to come live with us.",
        "Ian: And the wish came true.",
        "Lucy: But it nearly killed Kevin in the process.",
        "Ian: Be careful what you wish for.",
        "Lucy: I said the exact same thing to Rafe. What -- what does that mean?",
        "Ian: It's one of the lyrics from Caleb's song, \"be careful what you wish for.\"",
        "Lucy: Oh, my god, you're right. So all of this isn't just chance, is it? It's not bad luck or happenstance. This means we're dealing with the devil.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: No way, Livvie. Not again.",
        "Rafe: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Rafe: How'd last night go?",
        "Jack: Well, I've had better.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, listen, I want to talk to you about this whole thing with you and Livvie.",
        "Jack: No, no, not at the bar. Livvie almost busted us here the other night.",
        "Rafe: Right, I know, it's getting complicated. Probably for you, too, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I'm taking care of business. I've almost got Livvie worked up over Caleb where she's going to steal the ring. It's just a matter of time.",
        "Rafe: Ok, well, thanks, that's great, but I don't really need your involvement anymore.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, look, I'm going to go at this from a different angle.",
        "Jack: Whoa, you're cutting me out of the deal?",
        "Rafe: I thought this would be good news to you.",
        "Jack: No, you and Jamal begged me to do this, Rafe. Now you're going to cut me out?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that's right. Yes.",
        "Jack: Who in the hell appointed you to decide this?",
        "Rafe: Ok, hold on a second.",
        "Jack: No, you hold on. I will stay involved in this, whether you have say so or not.",
        "Rafe: Well, you think you're playing Livvie, but you're the one being seduced.",
        "Jack: Oh, what, you think I'm being sucked in by Livvie? You think I'm conning myself? No, not a chance.",
        "Rafe: No, you're not being seduced by Livvie. It's the ring. You want it for yourself now, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: The guy's face when you hit on red 22 -- we have got to go back. Baby, can we go back, please, please?",
        "Ricky: Yes, yes, we will, someday, ok? But Atlantic City is always going to be there. Besides, Jamal's going to kill me for ripping off his bike.",
        "Casey: I mean, not if you tell him you used it to blow off steam. He's going to understand.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, at least I'm returning it looking like brand-new.",
        "Casey: Well, of course, you know, if you are worried about what he's going to say, there's always Vegas.",
        "Ricky: Casey, no, all right? The fun's over. I can't be a party animal forever.",
        "Reese: You can say that again.",
        "Ricky: Reese.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Has anybody ever told you that you're paranoid, Rafe?",
        "Rafe: No, I'm not paranoid. I'm telling you, this is what the ring does to people.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, speak for yourself. I had the ring and I gave it back.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that was before you found out that it made wishes come true.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so?",
        "Rafe: So you're telling me that never crossed your mind? You know, what else you would wish for, maybe make your life a little easier, get everything you want -- namely Livvie?",
        "Jack: You know what, get the hell out of here. Go. Get the hell out of here.",
        "Rafe: Listen to me, listen to me, this ring, it's like a drug. One hit and you're hooked. Everything you think you're getting out of it you're going to lose twice as much.",
        "Jack: You know what, I've been handling Livvie just fine, just fine. And you know what, it feels good to kind of get her back. When she does get that ring, you know what -- I might make a couple wishes, and there will not be a damn thing that you can do about it.",
        "Rafe: I wouldn't be so sure about that.",
        "Jack: Oh, really? Well, what are you going to do, Rafe, kill me? Oh, Rafe. Kind of makes you wonder who the real nut job is around here, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Imani, you want to talk about this?",
        "Imani: Look, I'm sorry that I missed our date, and I'm sure that you must have a lot of questions, but right now I'm tired and --",
        "Jamal: Wait, come on, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! You're sorry you missed our date? You're sure I have a lot of questions? Imani, I kicked this door in. Look, I come in here and this room is a mess. I go over to this window and I see these scratch marks on the windowsill, like somebody couldn't wait to get the hell out of here. You're gone all night, I'm going out of my mind looking for you, ok, and then I find this in the woods, Imani.",
        "Imani: Look, I'm sorry, I just --",
        "Jamal: Just tell me what happened.",
        "Imani: Nothing happened, ok? Look, I was getting ready for our date and I heard a sound. I panicked and I just took off.",
        "Jamal: Right. Right, that's why this room looks like it got hit by a tornado, right?",
        "Imani: I told you I panicked.",
        "Jamal: Was it him? Was it him? Was he here?",
        "Imani: No. I'm not lying to you.",
        "Jamal: Then why did you have to get out of here in such a hurry? And how the heck did you leave scratch marks like that in the windowsill?",
        "Imani: They're not mine.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, they're yours, Imani. Have you seen your nails? They're torn and they're bloody.",
        "Imani: Oh -",
        "Jamal: Look, Imani, just tell me the truth, ok? You did all this. You did this. You did that and the scratches and everything. You did this. Just tell me the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: I can explain, all right?",
        "Reese: Ricky, you stood me up. You vanished for days without telling anyone where you were.",
        "Ricky: Look, would you chill out for a second?",
        "Reese: You were with Casey, weren't you?",
        "Ricky: Reese, stop.",
        "Reese: Just blew off everything, which is, you know, fine by me, but you even dumped on the band.",
        "Ricky: I didn't dump on the band.",
        "Reese: Oh, really? Is that why I had to cover for you with Caleb? Because, you know, spinning a lie to the big bat can be a bit risky on the neck.",
        "Ricky: Listen to me, I didn't ask you to cover for me, all right? Besides, I don't even know what you want me to do.",
        "Reese: Well, you know a big \"thank you\" would be a nice thing, even a little one. Then maybe you could come back to the real world with the rest of us instead of hanging out with a dead girlfriend who no one can see but you.",
        "Ricky: Look, you need to stop it, all right, because this is complicated.",
        "Reese: No no, it's not. It's a fantasy. This is real.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Ok, Rafe, so what's the deal, you going to drive a stake through my heart or are they just for vampires?",
        "Rafe: You know what, killing you isn't exactly an option, but I would break a couple of your bones to get the ring back. You don't know what you're dealing with here, man.",
        "Jack: Oh, and you do? You always do, right?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I've had a little more experience than you!",
        "Jack: Right, because you're the vampire slayer, I mean, or the angel. Wait a second, you're the ex-angel. Rafe, you don't live in heaven anymore.",
        "Rafe: Ok, all I'm saying --",
        "Jack: I don't care what you're saying. Who do you think you are, god himself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: Leave me alone, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: No, Imani. Not a chance.",
        "Imani: Don't make me lie to you, because I will. I have to.",
        "Jamal: Why don't you just tell me the truth? Imani, I'm not going to freak out on you, ok? You have nothing to be ashamed of. You're talking to me, ok, and you remember what I am, right? Ok, how can your truth be any worse than that?",
        "Imani: I thought he found me.",
        "Jamal: The guy that's been following you, right?",
        "Imani: Yes, I heard something. And I went there, there was nothing, nobody there, and I locked the door and I just panicked. And this idea that I have to keep looking over my shoulder, like I'm hiding, like I'm just some animal trapped in a cage, and -- I ran. I just took off and I kept running, and I ran till I couldn't run anymore.",
        "Jamal: Was it him?",
        "Imani: No. If he'd have been close, he would've found me. If he thinks I'm alive, he won't stop. So he'll just keep coming, and I'll just keep running.",
        "Jamal: Imani, you know you could've come to me, right? I'm here for you.",
        "Imani: I've been doing this so long. The first thing that came to my mind was just escape.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Been there, done that. I know what that's like when you want to just run away from everything. I know. But look, do me a favor, ok? Don't run away from me.",
        "Imani: I don't want to involve you in this. You don't know this guy, and I cannot ask you to make those risks.",
        "Jamal: Shh, Imani, just stop. Don't you know by now?",
        "Imani: Know what?",
        "Jamal: I'd face anything for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Can you see what the dog is holding between his paws?",
        "Christina: A book.",
        "Kevin: Yes, that's right! You know what -- sometimes, you can look them right in the eye and you can tell what they're thinking, just like people. You just have to listen really hard.",
        "Christina: I like it when you're home with me, daddy.",
        "Kevin: Oh, honey, I love every minute I get to spend with you.",
        "Christina: You're going to be here forever, daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Christina had Caleb's ring?",
        "Lucy: She had it, and she somehow made that wish that Kevin would be here. And I heard her. I did hear her say that. But that's not the only wish.",
        "Ian: What do you mean it wasn't the only wish? What are you --",
        "Lucy: Jamal. When I told you about this, when Jamal was here, remember, I was so angry, so I kind of told him all about Kevin trying to get child services to take Danny away --",
        "Ian: I know, you told me that. Now, go on.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Jamal must have had the ring. Because I told him I wished that that horrible man that was Kevin would go back to being his -- the good one, the good old self.",
        "Ian: And that's when Kevin snapped out of it.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. This could be really very bad.",
        "Ian: Could be bad? This is -- anything Caleb touches is bad. And now what, now there's a magic ring that can grant wishes? You kidding me?",
        "Lucy: Exactly. And Christina touched it. My little girl held that ring and she wished for her daddy to come live with us, and he almost died to make that innocent little wish come true!",
        "Ian: All right, hang on. If Kevin is here because of a wish and if all these wishes turn bad because of Caleb, there's only one thing we can do. We need to get him out of here today, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: You mean that? That you would --",
        "Jamal: Do anything for you? I'm here, aren't I?",
        "Imani: It's just that I've never had anybody be there for me like that.",
        "Jamal: Well, all that means is that this world is filled with a bunch of blind idiots. Come here.",
        "Imani: When I'm with you, I can almost forget that I have somebody following me. The peace that you give me, it feels so good, like I can just pretend that everything's ok and I'm ok and I'm just normal.",
        "Jamal: Well, you deserve that 24/7.",
        "Imani: Oh, god, I wish.",
        "Jamal: No, no, no. Please, no wishes, ok? Just -- just fact here. Everything's going to get a lot better as soon as you move into my place.",
        "Imani: Jamal, I thought that we were clear about that.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you know, we're crystal-clear about, like, what happened, but just not what to do about it.",
        "Imani: But, Jamal, I told you, I don't want --",
        "Jamal: No, no, seriously, Imani, I don't want to hear it, ok, not after seeing how afraid you are after this guy that's been chasing you around.",
        "Imani: But --",
        "Jamal: No, no, just -- you're moving into my place or I'm bedding down at your doorstep.",
        "Jamal: What you doing?",
        "Imani: You don't know what you're in for.",
        "Jamal: I think I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Whoa.",
        "Reese: That's what kissing a real girl is like. So whenever you want, however you want it, but you have to forget about that girl in your head.",
        "Ricky: Look, Reese, it's not a dream, all right?",
        "Reese: Listen, you're missing out on life, Ricky. That's not what you want, not really. Which is why I have a big surprise for you. Come on.",
        "Ricky: Wait, wait, wait. Where are we going?",
        "Reese: Finally you're going to spend the whole day with me and I'm going to show you.",
        "Ricky: Look, I can't, all right? I got things to do, and besides, I still got to think.",
        "Reese: Think about what? I'm right here. You don't even want --",
        "Ricky: Listen, I'll see you later, ok.",
        "Reese: Wait, Ricky, wait! What a waste. Seeing a guy like that waste his time on a girl who's gone, who can't even -- my god, where did that come from? I'm out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Come here.",
        "Jack: Get your hands off of me! What's wrong with you, man? I decide not to do things your way, so you go off and hit me? Rafe, Rafe, the man with all the answers. Unbelievable.",
        "Rafe: I never said that.",
        "Jack: I don't know how Alison deals with you.",
        "Rafe: You leave her out of this, ok?",
        "Jack: No, you walk around with all this self-righteous crap, trying to throw it off on everybody else like it's going to do us some good.",
        "Rafe: All right, you don't understand. This ring, it's dangerous. If we don't get it away from Caleb --",
        "Jack: Oh, what, we might have a little fantasy before you do? Rafe, you don't need the ring. You have everything that anybody could possibly wish for. You're just too stupid to see it and appreciate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I can't do that. I just can't ask Kevin to leave.",
        "Ian: You have to. Everything makes sense now, doesn't it kind of, with the wish and --",
        "Lucy: Do you know what does make sense? That kiss that happened on the picnic. Remember? I told you, it came out of nowhere and it didn't mean anything. I saw Christina playing with her dolls, and she must have made her dolls kiss. So I was right, and you thought, you thought all along --",
        "Ian: You don't know what I thought, I don't know what I thought, but I knew it wasn't you. I was right.",
        "Lucy: It wasn't me. I was right.",
        "Ian: The fact remains that Caleb is involved in this somehow, and now Christina.",
        "Lucy: Christina loves her daddy so much and she wants him at home.",
        "Ian: This is our home, not his. This is ours.",
        "Lucy: I know. I know. This whole thing is horrible. It's not making it any easier for us, is it?",
        "Ian: I know you want to do what's right for Christina, but maybe the thing that's right for Kevin is to try to somehow undo this wish. I mean, it hasn't done him any good so far.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you're right. But it's going to break her heart, and you know it'll break his heart. It will. This is really hard.",
        "Ian: He'll be fine. I'm going to get the lighthouse ready. I'll call the nursing service. It'll be ready tomorrow. Ok? Come here.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Everything's going to be fine, right?",
        "Ian: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Fine. Right, everything. Kevin needs to leave so everything will be fine.",
        "Kevin: That's it, honey, you just sleep. And daddy will be here when you wake up. Hush, little baby don't you cry daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird and if that mockingbird don't sing daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring."
