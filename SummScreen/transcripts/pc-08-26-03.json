        "Chris is curious about why Kevin will be moving back into the lighthouse. When Ian good-naturedly describes himself as a natural-born hero, Chris points out that he's kicking poor old Kevin out in the cold. Caleb wakes up as Olivia tries to remove his ring. Olivia worries that Caleb is bored with her now that he has everything he has ever wanted. Lucy gently wakes Christina and sends her off to clean her room. She tries to broach the subject of getting Kevin to move out, but he has already made the decision to do just that. He wishes that he could turn back the clock to their wedding day. If he weren't trapped in a wheelchair, he would fight for her. Lucy tells him that it would be a losing battle, because she loves Ian. When Ian tells Kevin that everything has been taken care of, Kevin realizes that they had intended to kick him out. He asks to speak with Christina alone. Christina asks Kevin to stay. Caleb finds Alison's charm and moves it out of sight with his foot so that Olivia won't see it. Chris is stunned to hear that Elizabeth has turned his penthouse into the clothing production center. Still angry about Jack's accusations, Rafe asks Alison for her honest opinion as to whether he has a God complex. After initially laughing at the question, Alison carefully tells him what might give people that idea. Insulted, Rafe accuses her of thinking he's a world-class ass. After apologizing for not taking her feelings into account, Rafe asks Alison to tell him when he's being a jackass. When Alison tells him about planting her charm at Caleb's loft, Rafe loudly tells her that it was a dumb thing to do. While Jack observes form the bar, Alison complies with Rafe's request and informs him that he is being a jackass. Rafe worries that Caleb will know what she's up to, and he doesn't like the prospect of dealing with an out-of-control Caleb. Caleb examines the charm and knows exactly what Alison was trying to do."

        "Ian: Lucy's telling him right now.",
        "Chris: Oh -- more bad news.",
        "Elizabeth: Chris, thank god. I have got to talk to you.",
        "Chris: This is a hospital. I'm the doctor. I'm working now, ok? Later.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, this is important.",
        "Chris: Yeah, so is the enlarged prostate in cubicle three. Later, please.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, hold on. I got to get that. Yes?",
        "Ian: How's it going with dress-up boy anyway?",
        "Chris: Dress-up boy is ready to fly back to Milan and cut his own head off. So, back to Kevin. Where was I?",
        "Ian: You were about to say \"I told you so\" about him moving in.",
        "Chris: Ah, yes. Well, it's a curse to be right all the time, but, you know, what can I say? So, what happened?",
        "Ian: I -- let's just say that his moving in wasn't a coincidence.",
        "Chris: Uh-huh?",
        "Ian: And that's enough. It's going to be over today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey, punkin head. What are you doing? You can't take a nap right now. You have a big play date planned, remember? So you know what that means.",
        "Christina: Time to clean my room.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, afraid so.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, but you have to give daddy a big kiss first. Oh, thank you, honey.",
        "Lucy: Ok, punkin, come on, let's get going. You know what you have to do. You have to remember to get all your toys in the toy box, ok? I'll be in in a little while.",
        "Lucy: Do you know how people always say that time goes by so fast and children grow up so fast? That's true. I didn't believe it until now. Listen, I need --",
        "Kevin: You don't have to say anything.",
        "Lucy: I really need to. I need --",
        "Kevin: No, you don't. We know that my being in this house isn't working and it's no good for anyone -- not me, not Ian. Certainly not you. I think it would be best for everyone if I just left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Just have someone bring the check over, ok?",
        "Jack: Whatever you say, your holiness.",
        "Rafe: Joke's over, jack.",
        "Jack: Right, because you said so. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Rafe: Hi.",
        "Alison: Sorry I took so long. I didn't want to interrupt with you over there. Are you ok? Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Huh?",
        "Alison: Are you trying to figure out how to get Caleb's ring off his finger?",
        "Rafe: You know what? There are other things I think about besides Caleb, you know?",
        "Alison: Ok. Anyways, I wanted to talk to you about something. When I was at Caleb's apartment last night, I wanted --",
        "Rafe: I don't want to talk about Caleb, all right? I'm sick of talking about Caleb.",
        "Alison: You are?",
        "Rafe: Let me ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me. I don't want you to tell me what you think I want to hear, ok?",
        "Alison: Ok. You're starting to make me a little bit worried here. Is there something going on?",
        "Rafe: Do you think I have a god complex?",
        "Alison: A god complex? What are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack's voice: He who has the ring has the power that will beat Caleb.",
        "Livvie's voice: No. We have the ring, and we will use it to our advantage.",
        "Jack's voice: Oh, I don't see it on you anywhere.",
        "Livvie's voice: It belongs to both of us.",
        "Jack's voice: For right now. But with your track record, you won't be lasting through eternity. You see, Livvie, Caleb's going to wake up and see that you're high maintenance. And then some blonde's going to turn his head and he's going to jump at it. And when he does leave, he's going to take the ring with him and you're going to be left with nothing.",
        "Livvie: I won't let that happen. If I could only take --",
        "Caleb: Olivia.",
        "Livvie: Caleb. I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Caleb: What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Caleb, I'm sorry. I was -- I was just -- I was trying to get up, and I didn't mean to wake you.",
        "Caleb: Is everything ok?",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I mean, why -- why wouldn't it be after the night we had, lying here next to you, watching you sleep?",
        "Caleb: What's on your mind?",
        "Livvie: Can I ask you something?",
        "Caleb: Anything.",
        "Livvie: Are you bored with me?",
        "Caleb: This isn't the stuff with Alison again, is it?",
        "Livvie: No. No, it has nothing to do with Alison. It's just a little bit of everything.",
        "Caleb: Meaning?",
        "Livvie: Meaning I know you, probably a little bit too well, Caleb, just tell me, please. I will do --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok. That's not exactly the reaction I was expecting.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sorry. You were just -- you looked so serious, and you just started --",
        "Rafe: I am, I am. It seems that there are some people who are thinking that maybe I'm acting like the man who knows everything -- you know, about Caleb, about the ring.",
        "Alison: Oh, well, I don't -- I don't really know anything about god complex really, but you did come from heaven.",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
        "Alison: I mean, you know sort of more than most people, I guess.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I know the way things work.",
        "Alison: I think sometimes this happens where people might have some, you know, some good ideas that maybe you don't really give them credit for, and maybe you come off a little bit harsh, and that might rub people the wrong way a little bit.",
        "Rafe: So -- hmm. You're saying I'm just a world-class ass, huh? That's great.",
        "Alison: What? No. I didn't say that. Those words never came out of my mouth.",
        "Rafe: Do I rub you the wrong way?",
        "Alison: Are you kidding? Are you really serious?",
        "Rafe: Tell me the truth.",
        "Alison: No, not at all. You know, there are some times when I feel like maybe you think that I should be able to read your mind a little bit and maybe do things the way that you do them. And there has been a couple of times when I've even wondered if you've respected my choices.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I don't think I understand. What do you mean, you're leaving? I don't know what to say.",
        "Kevin: You opened your home to me to help me recover this far. What more can you do? Besides, after last night, I knew this would never work.",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, after last night?",
        "Kevin: Don't tell me you forgot? I tried to talk to you about it.",
        "Lucy: I know. I -- I know what you were doing, though. You were hurt and you were just lashing out at me because you were frustrated and --",
        "Kevin: That's only part of it, Lucy, and it's not even the hardest part. The hardest part is that I must have been an idiot to think I could ever handle you and Ian together.",
        "Lucy: Kevin --",
        "Kevin: Look, it's one thing to know that you're with him. It's another thing altogether to see it, to live with it, to see you sharing everything together. Maybe my body's betrayed me, but my heart works just fine. And it hurts. It just plain hurts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: How's our research going?",
        "Chris: It's slow. But, you know, under normal circumstances, this synthetic blood is going to take some time.",
        "Ian: Yeah, but you being the genius that you are, I mean --",
        "Chris: Yeah, it's going to be possible.",
        "Ian: What about the added ingredient?",
        "Chris: Well, we're still looking for that. I'm not sure. I mean, I just wish there was a bigger market for finding a drug that would make people grow old and die.",
        "Ian: Well, that's what I want. If you were a vampire yourself, you'd want that, want the choice.",
        "Chris: I'll have to take that on faith. But, you know, maybe now that Kevin's out of the picture, we can work on this together, maybe?",
        "Ian: I don't care what anyone says. You're all right.",
        "Chris: Oh, you mean the being nice thing? No. Let me tell you something. I've been a jerk my whole adult life and parts of my childhood. And I'll tell you, saving her butt now with Georges, yours in the research lab -- it's exhausting. Way too much work.",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Chris: I don't know how you've done it all these years.",
        "Ian: Done what?",
        "Chris: Well, you know, you're too good of a hero.",
        "Ian: That's what I do. I'm a natural-born hero, you know.",
        "Chris: At least you used to be.",
        "Ian: What does that mean?",
        "Chris: Oh, here I am saving the world, and you're kicking poor old Kevin out in the cold. Shame.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Lucy, after all the time we've spent together, all the time that we were just us --",
        "Lucy: I do believe you are doc. I know you are. And I also know that we, us, will always be connected forever. But it's just too late for us.",
        "Kevin: If I could turn back the clock -- I know that I couldn't -- but if I could --",
        "Lucy: You need to think about what you're saying, because if you were to turn back the clock, that means you'd erase not only the bad things, but you'd also erase all the very good things, and I wouldn't want that. I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Kevin: For the record, I'd turn it back to our wedding day. There, I said it. And if I could be the man that I was and not trapped in this thing, I want you to know that I'd fight for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Thank you. You asked me to be honest with you, so I was.",
        "Rafe: I know. I know. You know what? Never mind. I'm sorry. I never want you to think that I don't value you, that I don't respect your choices, you know. So do me a favor, ok? Next time I act like that, just tell me. Just say, \"Rafe, you know what? You're -- you're being a jackass.\"",
        "Alison: Oh, is that an order?",
        "Rafe: No.",
        "Alison: Oh.",
        "Rafe: No. It is a request. It comes to you with complete, absolute love and affection.",
        "Alison: Look at you. Stop. I know what's in your heart, all right? I never, ever doubt that you love me. I just think that sometimes you need to let me make my own mistakes.",
        "Rafe: I know, all right? You know what I really need to do? I need to stop taking life so seriously. Look, so, you know what? Pay them, let's get out of here.",
        "Alison: Wait, I just got here.",
        "Rafe: I know, but you know what? Let's just take the day, make it our own. It's about us, you know? It's about our future -- no Caleb, no ring.",
        "Alison: Yeah, if only we could.",
        "Rafe: We can, ok? Come on, let's go.",
        "Alison: No, no, we can't. Listen, I need to talk to you. Please, come sit down. It's really important.",
        "Rafe: Let's go -- ok.",
        "Alison: Please, Rafe? Listen. Last night when I was at Caleb's apartment --",
        "Rafe: I don't want to talk about Caleb.",
        "Alison: I left a clue that I was actually there.",
        "Rafe: What kind of clue?",
        "Alison: I left the charm from my bracelet and I sort of placed it in a specific spot. Not really, you know, so obvious, but --",
        "Rafe: But Livvie might find it?",
        "Alison: Yeah, she might, and she might have already found it.",
        "Rafe: That was the wrong thing to do, Alison. You went way too far.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Why do you always question my love for you?",
        "Livvie: It's not you. It's me.",
        "Caleb: I've walked through fire for you. And I would do it again. You are all I've ever wanted, all I need.",
        "Livvie: I know I have nothing to worry about, and I wish it were that easy. I don't trust her. I mean, I trust you, which --",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I see what you mean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Finito. Outie like the audi. Now it's time for a nice cold very dry -- Elizabeth.",
        "Elizabeth: Can we have that chat now?",
        "Chris: You get five minutes, ok, then I'm going home. I have a date with my quiet little apartment and a martini.",
        "Elizabeth: Then you probably would like to prepare yourself.",
        "Chris: For what?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, you know, the teleconference that Georges had with all of the buyers went much better than expected.",
        "Chris: Ok, they bought it. So, that's super, you know, just as long as they don't find out that I'm Georges.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no, they won't.",
        "Chris: You know, I heard you on the phone earlier, and I liked that little part about having to work. That was a nice touch.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, well, it's real. We're in business. We're in real business.",
        "Chris: With employees?",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, and cost effective. Believe it or not, I actually found inexpensive American labor. It's going to be great --",
        "Chris: You know something? I would -- I would love to hear this, but then again, I wouldn't, because it's been a long day, and I don't know what the details have to do with me. So if you can excuse me, I'm going home.",
        "Elizabeth: That's actually the problem.",
        "Chris: What, the details?",
        "Elizabeth: No, going home. Don't give me that look. You're going to love them.",
        "Chris: \"Them\"?",
        "Elizabeth: Well, we had to find a place to begin production with these new employees --",
        "Chris: Oh, no.",
        "Elizabeth: And since I'm still living in the hotel -- yes, your penthouse --",
        "Chris: No, no, no.",
        "Elizabeth: Is perfect for the nerve center of Georges' manufacturing.",
        "Chris: Elizabeth --",
        "Elizabeth: Chris, don't worry about it. There's still room for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You know fighting for me would be a losing battle. I -- I love Ian.",
        "Kevin: But you're also in denial about who he is and what he is and how that will affect your future. But as you can see, I'm hardly in a position to offer an alternative.",
        "Ian: Hey.",
        "Lucy: Hey. I was just explaining to Kevin --",
        "Kevin: It's all settled. I'm leaving.",
        "Ian: I took care of all the details.",
        "Kevin: Details?",
        "Ian: Yeah. The light-house is set and Christina can come whenever she wants.",
        "Kevin: Oh. So, you'd already made up your mind that I was leaving. I just beat you to the punch.",
        "Lucy: I would like to explain --",
        "Kevin: You don't have to. It just means that we're on the same page, that's all. Well, anyway, thanks.",
        "Ian: For what?",
        "Kevin: For taking care of the details. And for giving me a little privacy one last time. Lucy, I'd really like to talk to Christina and tell her before she finds out some other way.",
        "Lucy: I -- I think maybe I should be there.",
        "Ian: It's ok. Come on.",
        "Lucy: We'll -- we'll go start packing.",
        "Kevin: Thanks.",
        "Christina: Daddy?",
        "Kevin: Oh, Christina.",
        "Christina: Don't go, daddy. Please stay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Well, that was very rude. I mean, whatever happened to letting me make my own mistakes?",
        "Rafe: Well, it's a pretty big mistake, don't you think? I mean, it was a dumb move, period.",
        "Alison: Hey, hey, hey, hey. This might be one of those jackass moments.",
        "Rafe: Well, you know what? You just should have come to me, ok, because I could have helped. I could have stopped you!",
        "Alison: Or maybe you could have what, backed off a little bit?",
        "Rafe: Ok. So you thought you would drop the charm and that Livvie would find it, freak out, and then she would get the ring. Right? That was your idea.",
        "Alison: Hey -- no, it was our idea, really.",
        "Rafe: Right.",
        "Alison: I mean, you're the one who said to bring Livvie into this whole thing in the first place.",
        "Rafe: No, no, not like this! I mean, what if Livvie doesn't find it first, right? What if Caleb finds it?",
        "Alison: So what if he does?",
        "Rafe: Well -- and what if he thinks you're playing him, huh?",
        "Alison: Why would he think that I'm playing him? He'll just think that I lost it.",
        "Rafe: All right, all right, wait a second, wait a second. You said he bought your whole story, right, your whole story of friendship and you guys were going to be friends no matter what, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah? So?",
        "Rafe: All right, so listen to this. What if Caleb finds your charm and then he has to deal with a flipped-out Livvie? Don't you think that that might put him over the edge? All right, listen to me. I know you think you did the right thing. But an out-of-control Livvie, ok, we can handle. An out-of-control Caleb maybe I can handle, and then you will all be hoping for my supposed god complex. But either way, Caleb loses it, it's going to be fatal for somebody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: How convenient, right where one of us would find it. Friends, huh?"
