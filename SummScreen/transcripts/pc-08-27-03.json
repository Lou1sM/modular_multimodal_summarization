        "Jamal moves Imani into his apartment, giving her the bed and taking the couch for himself. When he asks about the guy who's been chasing her, Imani says that he obsessed over her to the point where she had to run, and she's never stopped. Jamal promises to take care of her now, and Imani is touched to have someone to turn to for the first time. Alison is confident that Caleb won't hurt her, but Rafe isn't so sure. He comes up with a plan to get her charm back. Alison calls Caleb to ask him to the club so that she can tell him about a proposition she has for him. Believing she's up to something, Caleb agrees and takes Olivia with him. Alison enlists Jack's help distracting Olivia from her conversation with Caleb. When Reese tells Ricky about the busted light, he immediately suspects Casey but doesn't let on. Reese confides that she's changed quite a bit since becoming mortal again, and she would like to know whether he felt something when they kissed. Ricky warns her that they can't have a relationship, since every woman he becomes involved with goes away permanently. Thinking he's blowing her off, Reese tries to leave, but Ricky invites her inside for a drink. Over a beer, Reese apologizes for losing it, and Ricky invites her to a Garza family barbecue. When she goes home to change for the event, Ricky orders Casey to leave her alone. Casey laughs and doesn't bother to appear to him. Ricky wants her to leave him alone as well. Alison asks Caleb to play at her next fashion show, and he agrees. Olivia approaches Jack while they work out the details. Jack fantasizes about a happy ending with the old Livvie. Alison tells Caleb that she lost her charm at his loft, and Caleb tells her that he found it. They go outside, where Caleb places it in her hand and closes her fingers around it. Olivia looks outside and believes they are holding hands. Although Rafe's search of the loft doesn't produce Alison's charm, the slayer is quite pleased to find Caleb's hidden book."

        "Imani: Jamal, listen --",
        "Jamal: There you go.",
        "Imani: You don't have to carry everything. I can handle that little box.",
        "Jamal: You know what? Done. Too late besides, you know, everything really wasn't that much anyway.",
        "Imani: No, I guess not.",
        "Jamal: So? What you think? It's my pad.",
        "Imani: Of your place?",
        "Jamal: Check it out. Yeah.",
        "Imani: Yeah, it's --",
        "Jamal: You like, you like, you like?",
        "Imani: It's nice. It's small.",
        "Jamal: I'm going to -- I'm going to actually sleep on the couch. You can have the bed.",
        "Imani: Oh, no, let me -- I'm going to sleep on the couch.",
        "Jamal: No, no. I've crashed there millions of times, it's comfortable and everything.",
        "Imani: Jamal, please, I will sleep on the couch.",
        "Jamal: Hey, hey, hey --",
        "Imani: It's fine.",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, no. I'm going to crash here and that's you over there, ok? And then this is yours, too, just in case, you know, if you want a little privacy or something. Look, I know it's not much, but --",
        "Imani: No.",
        "Jamal: It's what I got.",
        "Imani: It's fine. Please, it's -- it's just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Caleb: Hey. I thought you were asleep.",
        "Livvie: I was, but now I am wide awake, so why don't you come back to bed with me.",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry. I got to go.",
        "Livvie: Why? I don't -- hey, what's this?",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Livvie: In your hand. What are you hiding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb will not hurt me. I know he won't.",
        "Rafe: Really? Why is that, hmm? Because -- because you're his friend?",
        "Alison: Yes. I do believe he thinks of me as his friend.",
        "Rafe: Alison, Caleb doesn't have any friends. Ok? He has lovers, he has acolytes, he has enemies, and you're definitely going to be on that list if he even suspects that you're running a scam on him.",
        "Alison: Why are you trying to scare me like this?",
        "Rafe: Because you need scaring. Do you know how dangerous it is what you are doing?",
        "Alison: I've been in more scary, dangerous situations than anyone I know, and I am still standing to talk about it, ok? So are you going to continue to mess with me, or are you going to help me try and figure out this problem that I've created for myself?",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, this is what I'm thinking. Maybe if we're lucky, nobody found the charm yet. So, where did you say you left it exactly?",
        "Alison: Well, I dropped near the couch. It wasn't completely obvious, but it was, you know, out there.",
        "Rafe: Ok. So maybe we can get it before anybody discovers it.",
        "Alison: And how are we going to do that?",
        "Rafe: First off, you're going to make a call to your little friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: I don't know what you think I'd be hiding, but as you can see, there -- there's nothing.",
        "Livvie: I knew that. I was just kidding.",
        "Caleb: You love giving me a hard time, don't you?",
        "Livvie: Only so I can make it up to you.",
        "Caleb: I can't wait. But right now, there's something I need to do.",
        "Livvie: Like what?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Livvie: Who is that?",
        "Caleb: Hello?",
        "Alison: Caleb. It's Alison. I need to speak with you. Can you meet me at Elixir?",
        "Caleb: What about?",
        "Alison: Let's just say I have a proposition for you. Can you be here?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, sure. Why not?",
        "Alison: Good.",
        "Livvie: Well, what is it?",
        "Caleb: It was Alison. She has something she wants to talk to me about.",
        "Livvie: You're going over there, then, huh?",
        "Caleb: No. We're going over there.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, go throw something on. I want you to come with me.",
        "Livvie: I'll be right back, then. Ok.",
        "Caleb: Ok, hurry.",
        "Caleb: You have been a very bad girl, Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb's on his way.",
        "Rafe: And knowing Livvie, she'll probably come along, right?",
        "Alison: Of course. You can count on it.",
        "Rafe: And while you're keeping them busy --",
        "Alison: You will be busy getting the charm, and then our problem, you know, will be solved.",
        "Rafe: Right. Problem will be solved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: That lamp post just exploded. If I was another foot closer -- what are you doing?",
        "Ricky: What?",
        "Reese: Don't tell me you're looking for her.",
        "Ricky: Oh, for Casey? Please. Are you kidding? Why would I be looking for Casey?",
        "Reese: Because you always are, Ricky. I just thought -- oh, never mind.",
        "Ricky: No, no, no, Reese. Come on. Tell me what you were going to say. You just thought what?",
        "Reese: Well, if you really want to know -- first, I want to tell you something.",
        "Ricky: Ok.",
        "Reese: Remember when we first met, before I turned back from you know -- I was leading a pretty wild life.",
        "Ricky: Yeah. No kidding.",
        "Reese: I mean, between that and the band, I was, like, the ultimate party girl. I did what I wanted, who I wanted. All I cared about was having a good time. We even, you know --",
        "Ricky: How could I forget?",
        "Reese: But I'm not that same girl anymore. Something's changed.",
        "Ricky: You're not a vampire anymore.",
        "Reese: No, besides that. I mean me. I've changed. I don't know when or how exactly. I just know that that night when I ran into you near Jack's, the old me would have tried to take advantage of that, but instead, I just wanted to hold you, make you feel better. I suppose what I'm trying to say in my own silly way is that there was something about your sadness, your sweetness that really touched me. And when I kissed you earlier before, I felt something more. And what I need to know is, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. Should I make your next one a decaf?",
        "Alison: Sorry. I'm just a little stressed out, that's all, but everything's going to be really good. Everything's going to be just fine.",
        "Jack: So, I guess that's what happens when you live with Rafe the almighty, huh?",
        "Alison: Don't do that. That's rude.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. He's starting to make Joshua look good with all the orders he's barking around.",
        "Alison: He's trying to help people, and I think that you really know that.",
        "Jack: Help?",
        "Alison: And don't compare him to Joshua, not in front of me.",
        "Jack: Oh, ok, ok, fine. Take up for Rafe. So, what's up with Livvie, you know, trying to get Caleb's ring? What's the new plan?",
        "Alison: There is no new plan. It's the same plan as there always has been. We're going to drive her crazy with jealousy, only I'm going to do it and you're not.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me?",
        "Alison: No, I'm not kidding you, and I think that it will really work.",
        "Jack: Ok, my god.",
        "Alison: I think that it's already working.",
        "Jack: I can't believe Rafe's putting you in the middle of all this.",
        "Alison: He didn't put me in the middle of this. I put myself in the middle of all this, and believe me, it took some convincing.",
        "Jack: So he agreed to let you go undercover?",
        "Alison: I'm quite capable, Jack. I can do this, even if I did, you know, screw up the first assignment a little bit, which is actually where I need you and your help. You need to do me a favor, ok? When Livvie comes in, I need you to, like, distract her --",
        "Jack: Whoa, Alison --",
        "Alison: Just a little bit.",
        "Jack: Alison, Rafe made it very clear that I was not needed in this whole thing.",
        "Alison: Come on. I won't put you in the middle of it at all. I'm just -- you know, I'm just asking you to occupy her a little bit.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Alison: Because you're my friend and because it wasn't fair for Rafe to put you and Jamal in the middle of all of this. And I promise you after tonight, you are not going to want any part of her or that ring or Caleb.",
        "Jack: But what if I have my own agenda with Livvie?",
        "Alison: Meaning what?",
        "Jack: Meaning maybe I could use Caleb's ring for a couple wishes.",
        "Alison: I promise you, you do not want any part of her or that ring. It is poisonous to anyone who wishes on it. It might even be poisonous to Caleb himself.",
        "Jack: Well, speak of the devil -- or should I say devils?",
        "Alison: Do me a favor, please, please, please? Ok. Livvie. Caleb.",
        "Livvie: Caleb tells me you have a proposition for him, and I would just love to hear what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Behold -- the wall of Jericho, just like in that movie, right?",
        "Imani: Yeah, except they strung a blanket up between them. All right. I guess I'll just get unpacked.",
        "Jamal: Well, hey, let me give you a hand with that. I can put your stuff up if you want.",
        "Imani: No.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Imani: No, I'm sorry. I mean, I can manage. I've been doing this for a while.",
        "Jamal: Yes, you have been.",
        "Imani: You know, if you can just show me where I can put my stuff up --",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Imani: Be careful.",
        "Jamal: The top two drawers in the dresser right there are yours. It's all you, all right?",
        "Imani: All right.",
        "Jamal: And then the top two shelves right here and the cabinet -- it's all you. All right?",
        "Imani: Thank you.",
        "Jamal: Cool, no problem.",
        "Imani: You really didn't have to do that, you know?",
        "Jamal: No, it was all just clutter. Seriously, I've been meaning to throw it out. I hadn't gotten time to do it yet.",
        "Imani: Well, that is one thing I don't have to worry about.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. It kind of sucks that that was all you were able to bring were those two boxes and a suitcase.",
        "Imani: Yeah, well, it's all I need.",
        "Jamal: So, listen, Imani, now that we're roomies and all, you ever going to tell me what's the real deal with you and this guy one day?",
        "Imani: Well, let's just say that he was obsessed with me. He wanted to own me.",
        "Jamal: Ok. So he's a stalker. There's nobody you could turn to, no family, friends?",
        "Imani: No --",
        "Jamal: Nothing?",
        "Imani: There was -- there was no one, no family, so finally I just did the only thing I could think to do.",
        "Jamal: You ran?",
        "Imani: And I kept running and I never stopped, never staying in one place for more than a month because I always knew that he was on my trail and he was going to catch me.",
        "Jamal: So when was the last time you actually saw this -- this creep?",
        "Imani: A year? Oh, god. Not nearly long enough.",
        "Jamal: Look, hey, hey -- just -- I don't want you to worry about it, ok? It's over. You don't have to run anymore or nothing like that because whoever this fool is, he's got to get through me to get to you, and that's no easy task. So, look, you're safe here. You're safe with me, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Of course I felt something, Reese. You kissed me.",
        "Reese: And?",
        "Ricky: And I thought you were trying to prove something.",
        "Reese: I was trying to prove that I like you a lot.",
        "Ricky: Reese, but you know that really couldn't go anywhere.",
        "Reese: Well, maybe I'm willing to take my chances on that.",
        "Ricky: Look, Reese, the girls that I get close to have a tendency of going away -- I mean, really going away.",
        "Reese: At least you've loved and been loved back. At least you have people that care about you, a family that gives a damn whether you live or die. I've never had that.",
        "Ricky: Reese --",
        "Reese: Not to mention every guy I've been involved with, I was there to give them a good time, to share a few beers with, a few laughs, maybe a roll in the hay before they went back to the ones they really cared about. So don't ask me to feel sorry for you because you're afraid to put yourself out there, afraid that someone might love you back. And don't you dare ask me to even try to understand.",
        "Ricky: Hey. Here. Come on. I think we could both use a drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You said you dropped it near the couch. Now, where is it? This isn't good. Maybe it got kicked somewhere.",
        "Rafe: Just stand back here. This is great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: My proposition is really quite simple. Caleb, I wanted to see if you wouldn't mind playing at the fashion show because we're going to have another one.",
        "Livvie: That was your proposition? That's why you dragged us all the way over here?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I know how busy you are, so I just wanted to check with you to see if you wouldn't mind doing that.",
        "Caleb: Sure, I'll do it. What are friends for?",
        "Alison: Yeah.. gosh, I didn't actually expect that to be so easy.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, it's going to be fantastic. I mean, it would be great publicity for both of you.",
        "Alison: You mean that that doesn't bother you? You don't mind?",
        "Livvie: No, not in the least. In fact, I think I'll give the two of you some time to work out the details. So take all the time you need.",
        "Alison: Wow. Was that really Livvie?",
        "Caleb: That's my girl.",
        "Jack: Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Jack.",
        "Jack: So I guess trouble in paradise seems to be over, huh?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, over for good.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so I guess that means Caleb's agreed to share the ring with you.",
        "Livvie: Contrary to what you think, Jack, I don't need Caleb's ring to prove that he loves me.",
        "Jack: As long as you're satisfied.",
        "Livvie: I am very satisfied. In fact, we had a long talk and Caleb made me see that I don't have anything to worry about, especially when it comes to Alison.",
        "Caleb: So that's why you called me all the way down here -- to see if the band will play your show?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I was just really anxious to get your answer.",
        "Caleb: Could have got it even faster on the phone. It makes me wonder if there isn't something else going on here.",
        "Alison: Ok. Look, here's the deal. I lost a piece of jewelry at your place when I was there. It was a charm from this bracelet. And I didn't want to say anything in front of Livvie because I know how she gets. She gets really kind of crazy with that sort of stuff. So I'm just really hoping that she didn't find it.",
        "Caleb: No. I did.",
        "Alison: Oh, good. Good, I -- good, because I wouldn't want to make trouble for both of you.",
        "Caleb: You already have, Alison.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Look, maybe it would be better if we continued this conversation outside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: I don't know how to thank you, Jamal, for everything that you've done. You're a really great friend.",
        "Jamal: Just know that I'm here for you -- a partition away, day or night.",
        "Imani: I'm going to go get ready for work.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, you do that because I already -- I got some stuff that I got to do at the bike shop, you know. Really been --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: I'm sorry I lost it on you earlier.",
        "Ricky: No. I understand. You've had a rough day.",
        "Reese: Anyway, I better get going. Thanks for the beer.",
        "Ricky: Wait, Reese. Wait a minute. Look, my folks are having this little barbecue. I thought maybe you might --",
        "Reese: No, thanks, Ricky. You don't have to do that.",
        "Ricky: Oh, I'm not doing anything. I'm just saying that maybe you were right. Maybe I do have a lot to be thankful for and sometimes it takes somebody else to help you see it.",
        "Reese: So this is a thank-you?",
        "Ricky: No. This is me rejoining the world. So, are you still willing to take a chance and meet a slew of even crazier Garzas?",
        "Reese: I'd love to meet your family.",
        "Ricky: Cool. Well, it's a date.",
        "Reese: I'll just go home and get changed.",
        "Ricky: All right. Pick you up in an hour?",
        "Reese: Ok.",
        "Ricky: All right. Now, you listen to me and you listen to me good, Casey -- if you're messing with her, leave her alone, all right?",
        "[Casey laughs]",
        "Ricky: Leave me alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, it all sounds good in theory, Livvie, but let's both get real. Things might seem ok now, but it's going to take the slightest thing to make them not ok, and let's just hope Alison is not caught in the middle of the crossfire.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, it's always about her, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Well, she's my friend.",
        "Livvie: What about me? Am I your friend?",
        "Jack: I care what happens to you, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Livvie: Oh, you are such a liar.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Livvie: We had a little moment, and we got carried away. You kissed me. That's it. Sorry.",
        "Jack's voice: No, Livvie, you got carried away. All you were doing is looking at another chance to play me again, but you know what -- it's payback time.",
        "Livvie's voice: We got carried away, and how could you blame me? Because you know you are the only man I ever loved and still love.",
        "Livvie: Hey, Jack. Have you seen Caleb?",
        "Jack: Um -- no. No. Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: This what you're looking for?",
        "Alison: Oh, my charm. Where did you find it?",
        "Caleb: Well, a suspicious person might say, \"right where you left it.\" But a friend -- he would just return it, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Oh, my god.",
        "Rafe: It's too good to be true."
