        "Karen: Any closer to finding out what makes a vampire a vampire? ",
        "Chris: Not unless you're not telling me about something in Gabby and Emilio's \r\nchart. ",
        "Karen: So no chance of finding a cure yet? ",
        "Chris: Nope, not for them or my brother. ",
        "Frank: Karen. ",
        "Karen: Hey. Shift over? ",
        "Frank: Yes, just now. You got a sec? ",
        "Karen: Yeah. ",
        "Chris: Take your time. Not like we're on the verge of a major breakthrough \r\nhere. ",
        "Frank: Hey, is everything ok? ",
        "Karen: No. Ian just found out Father Michael's not a priest. ",
        "Frank: You're kidding. ",
        "Karen: No, and since Eve is over at the monastery right now, Ian took off to \r\nwarn her. Hopefully, it's not too late. ",
        "Kevin: Karen? ",
        "Frank: Hey, hey, you guys are back. ",
        "Kevin: Have you two seen Livvie? ",
        "Karen: No. Why? Is something wrong? ",
        "Lucy: Well, we don't exactly know. She's not at the bike shop, not at the \r\nlighthouse. ",
        "Kevin: Someone at the Recovery Room said she was headed here. ",
        "Frank: Hey, hey, Ramsey -- ",
        "Chris: I'm way ahead of you, Frank. I'll check admissions. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Eve: Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: What has happened? ",
        "Ian: We may have killed Caleb. ",
        "Kevin: You what? ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Livvie: No, you're wrong! ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, thank God! ",
        "Livvie: Because Caleb's not dead. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie? ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Livvie: Ow. ",
        "Kevin: What happened to her? ",
        "Jack: Caleb's alive. ",
        "Eve: No! He can't be. ",
        "Livvie: He bit me. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God, no. ",
        "Livvie: And he's going to be coming to take me away with him soon. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, he won't. I won't let him. ",
        "Livvie: God, Dad, it's all my fault. I went to Caleb -- ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, it's not your fault. Caleb's pulling the strings. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and you broke through. You know, I wouldn't be here right now \r\nif it weren't for Jack. He found me with Caleb and he helped me remember how much \r\nI loved him. And when I did -- ",
        "Alison: Caleb disappeared. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but he'll be back. He's not giving up that easily. ",
        "Ian: We just left Caleb. ",
        "Kevin: And Michael at the chapel. ",
        "Lucy: They are the same person. ",
        "Eve: You know? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, that's just one of the things we found out in the old country. ",
        "Lucy: We also found out that Michael -- Michael is the talisman that protects \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Alison: Wait. His talisman is his brother? ",
        "Jamal: Wait, so he doesn't have a brother? I mean, he's like a split \r\npersonality or something? ",
        "Lucy: Kind of. Listen, the only way to beat Caleb is to go through and get to \r\nMichael first. ",
        "Ian: Hold on a second. We just left the chapel. It was on fire. There was an \r\nexplosion. Caleb was inside. What makes you think he's still alive? ",
        "Livvie: I can feel it. Caleb still has a hold on me somehow, and fire is not \r\ngoing to kill him. ",
        "Jack: You know, we have to turn the tables and set a trap. ",
        "Jamal: Right, right, right, make him play on our field for a change. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but how do we lure him in without tipping him off? ",
        "Eve: Through me. ",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? ",
        "Eve: Ian, he wants our baby. He'll do anything he has to to get his hands on \r\nour baby. ",
        "Ian: Meaning what? ",
        "Eve: Meaning I'll be the decoy. ",
        "",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? This is too dangerous. ",
        "Eve: What's more dangerous is doing nothing. Look at what he's done to Livvie \r\nand think about the threat he has over our child. Now, the only way to lure \r\nCaleb into our trap is to use something that he wants more than anything in this \r\nworld, and that's our son. And what's more -- ",
        "Ian: What's more, what? ",
        "Eve: You know how Michael feels about me. ",
        "Ian: Yeah -- crazy in love with you. So what? ",
        "Eve: That might be the only thing that can save us. ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "Eve: Michael trusts me. He knows my feelings for him are real, and because of \r\nthat, he won't let Caleb hurt me. ",
        "Ian: I'm not going to take a chance on this. ",
        "Eve: He didn't let Caleb hurt me in the chapel and he won't let Caleb hurt me \r\nnow. I may be our best chance at saving us. I'm willing to take the chance for \r\nour baby. ",
        "Ian: What if you're wrong? What if Michael doesn't come out to save you in \r\ntime? ",
        "Eve: He will. ",
        "Ian: What if he won't? What if Caleb just takes you away? ",
        "Eve: No. Michael won't let that happen. ",
        "Ian: Stop talking about him like he's two separate people. ",
        "Kevin: They are two separate people, Ian. It's classic psychosis. ",
        "Ian: Let me ask you something. What are you talking about? What does this \r\nhave to do with vampires? ",
        "Lucy: Caleb's talisman protects him from the rules about vampires that we \r\nknow, at least think we know anyway. ",
        "Kevin: Look, the one thing that we know for sure is that Michael is what is \r\nprotecting Caleb. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, and listen, Eve -- Eve, you're right. I think you may be the only \r\nthing that can draw Michael out and make Michael help us. ",
        "Ian: I will not risk my wife and my child to capture some monster. ",
        "Kevin: The monster has already hurt my daughter. ",
        "Ian: What are you asking me, Kevin? You're asking me to sacrifice my family \r\nto save your daughter. ",
        "Eve: Ian, please. ",
        "Kevin: I don't want to sacrifice anybody. I just want to find a way to get \r\nrid of him. ",
        "Karen: Ian, I know you're scared for Eve and the baby. So am I. But if \r\nbringing Caleb here and coaxing Michael out of him is the only way to destroy \r\nthe threat forever, then Eve's the one to do it. ",
        "Kevin: It's for all of us, Ian. There's a lot of innocent souls out there who \r\nhave no idea what's going on here. ",
        "Eve: And our son, another innocent soul. We can't bring him into this world \r\nwith the threat of Caleb hanging over our heads. This may be the only way we \r\nhave of protecting him. Please, don't stand in the way. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Livvie, I need for you to describe to me everything you're feeling.\r\n",
        "Jack: It's a hunger, man. I'm telling you. ",
        "Chris: I'm talking to her. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, guys, don't argue, ok? It just makes it worse. ",
        "Chris: Sorry. I'm just trying to understand all this. ",
        "Jack: I know. It's just hard for me to see her this way. ",
        "Jamal: Chris, it's the same kind of pains that Jack and Gabby were going \r\nthrough, ok? ",
        "Jack: Yes, she needs to feed. It's only going to get worse. ",
        "Livvie: Jack -- ",
        "Alison: Chris, isn't there anything that you can do for her? ",
        "Chris: Only thing we can do is give her some blood and then quarantine them, \r\njust like Gabby and Emilio. ",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa. \"Quarantine them?\" ",
        "Chris: Yeah. It's for your own good, and Livvie's and everybody else's. I \r\nhave to lock you up again. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Even if we go ahead with this plan -- and I'm saying \"if\" -- how do we \r\nadvertise this little trap of yours? ",
        "Eve: I'll go into labor. ",
        "Ian: You'll what? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. It's what he's been waiting for. ",
        "Ian: Kevin, for the love of God -- ",
        "Kevin: You know, the more I think about it, Ian's right, Eve. You don't have \r\nto do this. ",
        "Eve: Kevin, yes, I do. And I will. We have to get to Michael first in order \r\nto take care of Caleb. ",
        "Karen: And nobody else can bring out the Michael personality. ",
        "Ian: And then what? Let's say Eve does this. How do we know for sure we can \r\nget rid of Caleb? ",
        "Lucy: I do. ",
        "Ian: What, you're an expert all of a sudden? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. ",
        "Ian: Oh, perfect. Why don't you tell us. We're all listening. ",
        "Kevin: Watch it, Ian. ",
        "Ian: I'm asking a flipping question, Kevin! Let's say Caleb comes here and \r\nEve puts her life on the line, puts the baby's life on the line to bring \r\nMichael's personality out. Then what? ",
        "Lucy: Then all of you, all of you can clear out, and I'll take over. ",
        "Ian: Really? Nice. Yeah, we'll do that. Perfect. ",
        "Kevin: Ian -- ",
        "Ian: What makes you think you can take on this man by yourself? ",
        "Lucy: I'm a vampire slayer. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Whoa, what do you mean, for my own good? How's locking me up going to \r\nhelp anybody? ",
        "Chris: It's my bet that we haven't seen all of Caleb's tricks yet. Anybody \r\nwho's been bitten could still fall back under his influence. ",
        "Alison: He is making sense, Jack. ",
        "Chris: Under lock and key, we can keep you both fed without you having to \r\nkill and turning into full-fledged vampires. ",
        "Jack: Ok, Chris. If you have something else, if you have some other motive --\r\n",
        "Chris: No. ",
        "Jack: You better tell me. ",
        "Chris: No. I swear. Not this time. ",
        "Jamal: So you'll do it, Jack? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah. I'll take the chance. ",
        "Livvie: Well, can we stay together then? ",
        "Chris: Livvie, I -- no. I don't think so. If I've learned one thing so far, \r\nit's how powerful a vampire can be when they need to feed. I can't imagine two \r\nof them together. ",
        "Livvie: But, Chris, Caleb is still out there and he's going to be coming for \r\nme and I'm going to be all alone then. ",
        "Chris: No, I know. But I swear on my life I will do everything to protect \r\nyou. We have alarm systems, security guards. I'll do everything humanly possible \r\nto keep you safe. ",
        "Alison: \"Humanly possible.\" ",
        "Jamal: Human is all we have. ",
        "Livvie: Well, Jack, what do you think? ",
        "Jack: I think it's our only choice. ",
        "",
        "Ian: So, you're a vampire -- ",
        "Lucy: Slayer. ",
        "Ian: All right, and you're a licensed psychologist, that right, Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: She's telling the truth, Ian. ",
        "Lucy: Could you just take the leap? Just go with me on this. You didn't \r\nbelieve in vampires, now you do, so why shouldn't you believe in vampire slayers \r\nnow? ",
        "Ian: The trouble is believing that you're one of them. ",
        "Kevin: Actually, the problem is what you don't believe. At Lucy found out \r\nabout herself and her family could be the key to ending this nightmare. ",
        "Ian: So what, we're all in your hands then? ",
        "Karen: So how many other slayers like you are there, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know, but I think myself and my cousin Rafe, we're the last of \r\nthe line, I think. We are the last of the Kovich family. ",
        "Kevin: And hopefully Caleb is the last of his line. ",
        "Frank: Oh, thank God for that. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Listen, my cousin's really amazing. He taught me everything --\r\n",
        "Karen: The vampire slayer? ",
        "Kevin: Ian -- Ian, I know this is hard to trust. ",
        "Ian: Oh, no, I want to trust it, Kevin. I want to trust all of it. But I've \r\ngot this feeling. ",
        "Kevin: What kind? ",
        "Ian: That at the end of this adventure we're going to be lying dead, and my \r\nson and your daughter are going to be flying with Caleb. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Jack, your room should be just about ready. Give me two minutes? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Just don't rush us, all right? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, I'm so sorry. I should have been there for you. ",
        "Livvie: No, it's all right, dad. I know you and Lucy were just trying to \r\nhelp. ",
        "Kevin: Well, let's just hope it pays off. ",
        "Livvie: Well, it will, Dad, because it kind of has to. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, I am going to take care of Caleb. I promise you that. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'll know you tried. ",
        "Lucy: No. I'm going to do more than that. ",
        "Kevin: This is all going to be over before you know it. ",
        "Livvie: My fingers crossed. ",
        "Kevin: Right, Jack? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Your dad's right. We'll have it all back together before long.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Thank you for everything you've done for her. ",
        "Jack: You do what you have to do for people you love, right? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I'll see you soon. ",
        "Livvie: Over before we know it, right, Dad? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Fingers crossed. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, you have to believe that, ok? All of you, you just have to \r\nbelieve it, ok? ",
        "Jack: Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to do what the slayer \r\nsays. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and whatever happens, man, we got your back. All right? I'm \r\nready. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, thanks, to the both of you. ",
        "Alison: For what? ",
        "Livvie: For being the best friends. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: The best. ",
        "Jamal: You'd do the same thing for us. ",
        "Jack: Couldn't have done it without you, man. ",
        "Jamal: You're the boy. ",
        "Alison: Ok, Jamal, let's go before Chris comes back. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, we'll see you guys after the fireworks. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, we'll be telling this story for a long, long time. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, because the minute it's over, we're going to start forgetting \r\nit ever happened. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Later. ",
        "Jack: Later, man. I know you're still hooked on him, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to lie to you, Jack. But after everything that's gone \r\non, it's like I'm addicted, and that's what it feels like. I'm still so drawn to \r\nhim. ",
        "Jack: Caleb's your drug. ",
        "Livvie: And I don't know how to stop it. ",
        "Jack: You have to start thinking about us, about you and me, what we have.\r\n",
        "Livvie: I'll try, if you promise that we will be together forever. ",
        "Jack: I promise with all of my heart. Ok? ",
        "Chris: Jack, it's time. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: It's ok. Hey, I'm ok. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Livvie: Before we know it, right? ",
        "Jack: I love you. ",

        "",
        "Frank: Ok, last time -- Caleb gets here, Eve does whatever it takes to bring \r\nMichael out of him. And if she does -- ",
        "Eve: When she does. ",
        "Karen: What next? ",
        "Kevin: That's when Lucy takes over. ",
        "Lucy: Right. When Michael comes out, I destroy him. ",
        "Frank: Ok, then, it sounds like a plan to me. ",
        "Ian: We still don't know how to get Caleb here. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, and if Eve calls Michael to tell him the baby's coming, he'll \r\nprobably suspect something. ",
        "Frank: How can we trust Michael at all when he and Caleb are the same person?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Once the split occurs, Michael sees himself as two separate people.\r\n",
        "Karen: So, can we trust Michael or can't we? ",
        "Eve: Can. ",
        "Ian: Can't. Not for sure. ",
        "Kevin: If the split is complete, we can. ",
        "Jamal: Excuse me, but I think I know somebody who can actually get Caleb \r\nhere. ",
        "Eve: Who? ",
        "Jamal: Gabby. ",
        "Ian: He might be on to something. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: I talked to Gabby's parish priest, and he thinks he might have gotten \r\nthrough to her. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, but enough to get her to help us fight Caleb? ",
        "Ian: Possibly. I don't know. ",
        "Jamal: Well, she's my sister. Why don't I just try? ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait -- what? ",
        "Jamal: A long story. Just -- ",
        "Ian: Go on. Go. ",
        "Jamal: I'm out of here. Come on. ",
        "Kevin: I guess we all better start getting ready. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, all right. Look, I'll meet you back here. I need to get my stuff \r\nout of the rig. ",
        "Karen: Ok, I'm going to sign out to make sure nobody comes looking for me at \r\nthe worst possible moment. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",

        "Kevin: Come on. ",
        "Eve: All right. Don't you have some getting ready to do? ",

        "Eve: Ok. Well, then do you mind helping me get ready? This amulet protected \r\nme from Caleb before somehow. Is it ok with you if I wear it again? ",
        "Ian: Why, because Michael who gave it to you? No, I don't have a problem with \r\nthat. We need all the help we can get. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: You know, I always wanted to wear a nurse's uniform, but I thought it'd \r\nbe like a little hot, white miniskirt, you know. And look at what they wear \r\nthese days. I wanted it to look really, really hot. ",
        "Kevin: Still gives me ideas. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: Just be careful, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc, I will. I mean, I have to because I don't really have much \r\nchoice because I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing. I mean, Rafe handed me that \r\nweapon and he just told me I would somehow know how to use it. ",
        "Kevin: He said you would. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I guess I just have to have faith. ",

        "Jamal: I will. ",
        "Guard: Five minutes. ",
        "Jamal: Right. Hey, Gabby. I heard your old parish priest came by to see you. \r\nHe said he's still got faith in you. ",
        "Gabriela: What does he know? ",
        "Jamal: About your heart? I bet a lot. That's why I was thinking maybe you \r\ncould do me a favor. ",
        "Gabriela: What kind of favor? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I want you to call Caleb. Ok, tell him to come by the hospital. \r\nOk, just tell him. If you do, there's a chance that maybe you can get back to \r\nyour old self again, and possibly Emilio and Jack, too. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm not sure I can do that. ",
        "Jamal: Well, how'd you do it before? ",
