        "[Missing first 10 minutes, sorry]",
        "Marissa: Well, that was a complete waste of time. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah? ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I could have told you that before the interview. ",
        "Marissa: Your brother, I have finally come to see, is totally full of it. No offense\r\nthere, Jack. ",
        "Jack: None taken. ",
        "Marissa: What's his problem, anyway? ",
        "Jack: He wants to be a hero. Chris won't be happy unless they build a statue of him\r\ndown in town square. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, that's likely. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Marissa: So then Lancelot was his ticket to glory. ",
        "Jack: And I do believe it was yours, too, not too long ago. ",
        "Marissa: Hmm. I guess priorities change, huh? ",
        "Jamal: That's right. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, right. Hey, that's for Dr. Ramsey, right? ",
        "Bartender: Good guess. ",
        "Jack: All right, i'll take care of it. ",
        "Bartender: Thanks, man. ",
        "Jack: I will be right back -- or not. Ahem. It could be a pina colada by sunup down on\r\nthe beach. ",
        "Chris: All right, what's the big push for me to go to Bermuda with you? Huh? What, did\r\nAlison dump you? ",
        "Jack: She couldn't dump me because we weren't together. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but she was supposed to go with you. ",
        "Jack: I'm being sent there on a photo assignment. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but the second ticket to paradise originally was for Alison. ",
        "Jack: She couldn't make it. ",
        "Chris: She dumped you. ",
        "Jack: You know what? Forget it. ",
        "Chris: All right, just relax, hothead. Jeez. Ok, fine, let's put it this way -- Alison\r\n-- she had more important, pressing matters to attend to. ",
        "Jack: Ok, whatever. I'm settling for you. Ok? Besides, we're brothers. Don't you think\r\nthis would be a nice time for us to kind of bond? ",
        "Chris: Bond? Yeah, I guess we could make up for those lost years, I suppose. And at\r\nnight, you could braid my hair and we could talk about all those lost times -- ",
        "Jack: That would be fun, but I'm going to have to work, too. Besides, it's an excuse to\r\nget out of this crazy place. ",
        "Chris: Well, look, as great as it all sounds -- and it does sound great -- I just -- I\r\njust can't. ",
        "Jack: Bermuda, first-class ticket, condo on the beach -- ",
        "Chris: I know, I know. ",
        "Jack: Girls and -- ",
        "Chris: I understand, ok? It's just I've invested way too much time and energy, not to\r\nmention all the money, into this Lancelot thing. I just can't bail on him now. ",
        "Marissa: No way. Are you -- are you serious? ",
        "Lisa: I'm not kidding. It's what I just heard. The call came in at the hospital. ",
        "Jack: Hey, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Jack: What's going on? ",
        "Jamal: It's big news. Apparently there was a big fire out he old grain silo. Yeah. And\r\nguess who was caught right in the middle. ",
        "Chris: Just -- just don't say Lancelot. ",
        "Jamal: Your hero's a goner. ",
        "********************* ",
        "Alison: Why don't you sit up, ok? Ok, I'll get some water for you. ",
        "[Rafe coughs] ",
        "Alison: Here, drink this. Are you ok? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I'm ok. What the hell happened? ",
        "Alison: I -- I got here, and e place was on fire, and you were inside unconscious. ",
        "Ian: The fire department's on their way. How are you doing? ",
        "Rafe: I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't know how this happened. ",
        "Ian: It's all right. It's not your fault. ",
        "Rafe: I was talking to him -- to the avatar -- and then i don't -- i don't remember --\r\noh, no, I remember somebody hit me. ",
        "Ian: Did you see who it was? ",
        "Rafe: No. It was from behind. ",
        "Ian: Somebody wanted to put the avatar out of commission. Looks like they got their\r\nwish. ",
        "Rafe: Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: God, i can't believe -- I can't believe I almost lost you. ",
        "Rafe: What are you doing here? You were here? You -- you didn't go inside, did you? Did\r\n-- ",
        "Livvie: No, I -- i came along, and -- and I found you. ",
        "Rafe: What are you doing? You can't -- you can't do that. I mean, what -- ",
        "Livvie: I know -- ",
        "Rafe: Are you ok? The baby -- what about the baby? ",
        "Livvie: I know, sweetie. Yes, i am fine, and the baby is fine. We're fine. Um --\r\nAlison\r\ngot us out of there. She saved our lives. ",
        "Rafe: Thank you, you know, for everything. ",
        "Alison: It's ok. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Dad. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, are you all right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'm fine. The baby's fine. Gosh, how did you know to come here? ",
        "Kevin: Well, Ian told me that the avatar was here. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, he's dead. Someone must have hit Rafe over the head and started a\r\nfire. ",
        "Kevin: Ian didn't tell me that you were here. ",
        "Livvie: I know. I came because i was -- I was worried about Rafe, and then i saw him\r\nlying in there, and I tried to get him out, and -- and then I got stuck, and then the flames --\r\nthe flames were -- ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, you could've been killed yourself. ",
        "Livvie: I know.\u00a0 But I'm all right. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, you' pregnant. You can't keep endangering yourself like this. ",
        "Livvie: I know. Dad, I know. Please, I -- I just really don't want to hear it right\r\nnow. ",
        "Alison: Let me help you up. ",
        "Rafe: So I -- I guess you saved our lives, huh? I mean, Livvie and the -- the baby's. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Um ---it wasn't just me. I came in and heed (??) --\u00a0 ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Alison: Carry you out. ",
        "Rafe: Well, still -- you risked your life. ",
        "Alison: Well, you helped save me when I fell off the cliff, so I just figured I owed\r\nyou. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I guess we're even, huh? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess we're even. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I -- i thought you were in Bermuda, with Jack, though. I -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It didn't -- it didn't quite work out that way. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. Sorry. I guess that's lucky for me, huh? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was almost as if somebody up there knew that i would be needed here.\r\nI'm just so glad that i was here to help you. ",
        "[Sirens] ",
        "Alison: You have no idea how glad. ",
        "Alison: It looks like they're finally here. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. I guess I should go talk to them. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Are you going to be ok? ",
        "Rafe: Am I -- yeah. Yeah, I'll -- I'll be ok. You? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm ok. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. Guess I'll talk to you later, huh? ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Alison.\u00a0 I -- I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for getting us out of there. I\r\nmean, it's kind of funny because if i had died in that fire, it would have solved a lot of\r\nyour problems, wouldn't it? I mean, it would have been so easy for you to just walk away,\r\nbut you didn't. You know, you risked your own life to save me, but -- what i don't get is,\r\nwhy? Why -- why did you do that? ",
        "Marissa: Great. Yeah, by deadline. Yeah, thanks. Bye. ",
        "Jack: Ok, so what did they say? ",
        "Marissa: It's true. He confirmed the fire at the grain silo with Lancelot trapped\r\ninside. He's got another reporter, you know, covering all the factual stuff, so -- ",
        "jack: So he's really dead? ",
        "Marissa: Freaky, huh? ",
        "Jack: So i guess this is going to cost you, huh, bro? ",
        "Chris: I was going to market this place as the safest city in America. How many people\r\nwould flock here by the thousands? Their families and their wallets and their checkbooks.\r\nAnd they'd have me to thank. I mean, I bought up every spare piece of real estate in this\r\nmiserable little town, and now it's not worth squat. ",
        "Jamal: Tough break. ",
        "Jack: So, who is this shadow guy? I mean, you know, obviously. ",
        "Chris: It doesn't matter. You'll all figure it out soon enough. Just do a the math. ",
        "Jack: Ok. And what does that mean? ",
        "Chris: Bermuda, right? ",
        "Jack: Oh, man. ",
        "Chris: Let me see that. All right. Give me 15 minutes to pack. Nothing holding me here\r\nanymore. ",
        "Jack: All right. That's what I like to hear. ",
        "Chris: We'll raise some hell, have some fun. ",
        "Jack: Now, you're talking. ",
        "Jamal: Have a good shoot, all right? ",
        "Marissa: Have fun, guys. ",
        "Jack: All right. Hey, I'll call you when I come back -- if i come back. ",
        "Jamal: Wow. So that's it, huh? Mr. Lancelot goes out in a blaze of glory. ",
        "Marissa: That about covers it. ",
        "Jamal: Wow. ",
        "Ricky: Hey -- ",
        "Jamal: What's up? ",
        "Ricky: Have either of you guys seen Karen? She was supposed to meet me here. ",
        "Marissa: No. ",
        "Ricky: What? Who died? ",
        "Jamal: Karen's pal, Lancelot. ",
        "Ricky: He's dead? ",
        "Marissa: Looks that way. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Ricky: Oh. I'm not going to miss him. Actually, I'm not going to miss him at all. ",
        "********************** ",
        "Alison: If you honestly need to ask me why i saved you, then we're a lot different than\r\nI thought. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I guess so because if the situation were reversed, you know, I'm not so\r\nsure I would have -- ",
        "Alison: That you would have saved me? I'd really like to think that you would have. ",
        "Livvie: Why? ",
        "Alison: Because you and I both know that when our time on earth is up, it's not over.\r\nYou wouldn't let someone die because it would cost you your soul for all eternity. ",
        "Livvie: You actually think about stuff like that? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, Livvie, I do. Your soul is all the love you've ever felt in your whole\r\nlife. It's who you are. And it's definitely worth fighting for. ",
        "Livvie: We were best friends. How could we be so different? The only thing i fight for\r\nor believe in or worry about is what's in the here and now because nothing else really\r\ncounts. ",
        "Alison: Do you honestly believe that? ",
        "Livvie: I have never given my eternal soul a second thought. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe you should start. ",
        "Kevin: Rafe? I need to talk to you. ",
        "Rafe: Can it wait? ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Rafe: All right. Excuse me. What's going on? ",
        "Kevin: I think you and I need to get a few things straight about you and my daughter. ",
        "Ian: Did you see any sign of anyone in there? ",
        "Firefighter: I'm sorry to say if Lancelot was trapped inside that silo, there is no way\r\nhe could have survived. ",
        "Karen: Oh. Frank. Oh, Frank. Frank? Oh, my god, you're not breathing. Frank! Frank! ",
        ">> Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"Port Charles: Torn.\" ",
        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" -- ",
        "Frank: I have been charged with this incredible mission. I know what I am supposed to\r\ndo. ",
        "Kevin: Tell me the truth. Do you love my daughter? ",
        "Livvie: Do you love him enough to let him stay with his family? Ali, do you love him\r\nenough to walk away?"
