        "Kevin breaks the news of his imminent move to Christina, who looks at him sadly with her big blue eyes. Kevin promises to let her visit him every day but says that he really does have to go home now. Putting her little head down on his arm, Christina begs her daddy to stay. Lucy tries to come to terms with Kevin's departure. Although she wishes that Kevin had never changed into the horrible person he was for so long, she knows that she and Ian would still be together now, no matter what. With Christina's wish coming apart, Kevin finds that he can move his left hand. Rafe is excited to stumble on Caleb's book. When Olivia confronts them outside the club, Caleb and Alison explain why they are together. Fighting her insecurities and jealousy, Olivia asks Caleb not to make her struggle any hard than it already is. Rafe fills Alison in on his discovery at Caleb's loft and tells her of his intention to go to hell, just as Caleb did. He silences Alison's protestations with kisses. Back at the loft, Caleb senses something amiss but sees nothing suspicious. Olivia finds a ring in the jewelry box and assumes it's the fake that Caleb used to fool Alison. Getting an idea, she keeps it for an opportune moment. Giving Caleb a relaxing massage, Olivia removes his ring and replaces it with the one she found. She tells Caleb that she wants to be the only one to ever touch him this way. Caleb opens his eyes in awareness. Believing the coast is clear, Rafe calls on Caleb's father as if he himself is the vampire's son. Alison is horrified to witness him vanish before her eyes."

        "Ian: All right, I screened all the nurses myself. They're excellent.",
        "Kevin: Great.",
        "Ian: It's going to be fine.",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you ok?",
        "Lucy: Um, fine. Why do you ask?",
        "Kevin: It's just always rare when you're so quiet.",
        "Lucy: No, I'm fine. I just think maybe I should I help you explain.",
        "Kevin: I still think I should do it myself, Lucy.",
        "Ian: Come on.",
        "Lucy: Hey. Come here.",
        "Kevin: Christina, come over here next to daddy. Honey, you know how much I've loved being here with you and how much fun we've had, right?",
        "Christina: It's helping you get better?",
        "Kevin: Oh you have no idea how much it's helped. But now I have to finish getting better at my house.",
        "Christina: No, daddy, you can't leave me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I hope we're doing the right thing.",
        "Ian: We are doing the right thing. For everyone.",
        "Lucy: I just can't help thinking that none of this would be happening except for that horrible ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: I've always heard about this. Centuries worth of vampire history, rituals, incantations --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: You might want to be more careful with that in the future. You wouldn't want to lose such a -- a lovely charm.",
        "Alison: Oh, god.",
        "Livvie: Do you want to hear something funny? From in there, it looked like the two of you were holding hands.",
        "Alison: Yeah -- no, it wasn't what it looked like at all. Actually, I lost a charm for my bracelet, and Caleb found it. He was just giving it back to me, that's all.",
        "Livvie: Then why are you acting so guilty?",
        "Alison: Excuse me?",
        "Livvie: If I didn't know any better, I'd say the two of you were hiding something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Is there a problem, Olivia?",
        "Alison: Look --",
        "Livvie: No problem.",
        "Alison: I'm really -- I'm not trying to start anything.",
        "Caleb: There's no need to explain, Alison. Livvie understands it was all perfectly innocent.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you should really think about getting that charm fixed because next time you just might not be so lucky.",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Livvie: So if the two of you are finished with your business, what do you say we go home and pick up where we left off?",
        "Caleb: Absolutely. Are we done with our business, Alison?",
        "Alison: Yeah, we're finished for now. I'll get back to you on the date for the fashion show. I really appreciate you playing.",
        "Caleb: My pleasure.",
        "Alison: And thanks again for your help. I appreciate you finding this.",
        "Caleb: Oh, I'll bet.",
        "Alison: Ok, well, I'll see you later.",
        "Livvie: Bye.",
        "Caleb: See you later. It's been an interesting day.",
        "Livvie: Ahem -- yeah. Pretty interesting. Can I ask you something?",
        "Caleb: Mm-hmm.",
        "Livvie: Is this a test or something?",
        "Caleb: Why would I be testing you?",
        "Livvie: Gee, I don't know. It seems like anytime Alison's around, you find some way to throw it in my face.",
        "Caleb: Really? Is that what I'm doing?",
        "Livvie: What, are you guys friends?",
        "Caleb: Maybe we're friends. Or maybe I have my own reasons for keeping her close by.",
        "Livvie: Which are?",
        "Caleb: My own reasons.",
        "Livvie: I really am trying to do what you asked and fight these stupid insecurities about Alison. I am trying as hard as I can. Please don't make this any more difficult than it already is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: But, honey, I'm not leaving you, I'm just going to the lighthouse. So you can come see me there, and you can come visit me every single day, I promise. We'll play games and we'll read stories and watch videos. We'll do everything that we do here. Please, honey, don't be sad. I love you very, very much, and I always will, no matter what.",
        "Christina: What about mommy?",
        "Kevin: Honey, I'll always love mommy. But I can't be there the way she needs me right now -- not the way I am right now.",
        "Christina: But I don't want you to go. Please, daddy, stay!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: He wants to go home. He's ready.",
        "Lucy: I know, it's just -- it's really hard having him here. I know that. But I keep thinking about what if you could turn back the clock? What if he really could go back to before he became that horrible man?",
        "Ian: You can't want that.",
        "Lucy: Why not?",
        "Ian: Because if he did that, we wouldn't be together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, good, you are here.",
        "Rafe: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey. Rafe you ok?",
        "Alison: Yeah, no, I'm good.",
        "Rafe: He found it, didn't he?",
        "Alison: Yep, he found it. I told him I lost it, though.",
        "Rafe: Did he believe you?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I hope so. But with Caleb, he sort of makes you always feel, you know, like you're not on balance or something.",
        "Rafe: Right. What about Livvie?",
        "Alison: If looks could kill, I'd probably be dead right now. See, she seems to be on her best behavior. I think that she's afraid of losing him.",
        "Rafe: Good.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Good, maybe, I guess.",
        "Rafe: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Rafe: What, what?",
        "Alison: I get really nervous with Caleb, like he's -- he always knows what we're doing or he knows what we're thinking or something, like he's just given us enough rope to hang ourselves.",
        "Rafe: Well, that's probably what he's going for.",
        "Alison: Well, you seem a little calm about that. I mean, you don't really think that maybe he's on to us. I mean, do you, or --",
        "Rafe: You know what, he might be. See, here's the thing. Caleb -- he doesn't trust anybody. He never will. That's the reason he's survived for so many years. I mean, he's his own counsel. That's why Livvie is going to always feel partially shut out because he's never going to let anybody in -- not completely.",
        "Alison: That just seems, like, so lonely.",
        "Rafe: Well, it is, but it's the life he chose. And it's his legacy to follow in the footsteps of his masters.",
        "Alison: What is that? What are you doing?",
        "Rafe: Huh?",
        "Alison: What? Are you quoting something?",
        "Rafe: No -- well, I mean, I always knew that, but I just had it confirmed for me in a book.",
        "Alison: What book? What are you talking about?",
        "Rafe: I stumbled upon this book when I was at Caleb'S. It's a complete history of the vampire universe. There's even a little section on the ring.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god. Where is it?",
        "Rafe: Well, everything I need is right here.",
        "Alison: Wait. Wait, I don't understand. You didn't bring it back?",
        "Rafe: No -- well, come on, I don't want him to know that I found it.",
        "Alison: Oh, right.",
        "Rafe: Besides, I only needed the answer to one question, so --",
        "Alison: Which is?",
        "Rafe: How the hell did he get the ring back?",
        "Alison: We know how he got the ring back. He got it after the fashion show.",
        "Rafe: Yes, yes, yes. But there are no coincidences in Caleb's life. See, that song he played at the show -- there was a message in it that was supposed to draw the ring back to him.",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rafe: Right? Now, obviously, he didn't have that message before.",
        "Alison: Because he would have used it a long time ago.",
        "Rafe: Right. So my guess is, is he had to travel a very long way to find out what it was. He had to talk to the one person who knew. His father.",
        "Alison: Caleb's father? Isn't he, like -- I mean, isn't he dead or in hell or something? Wait, wait, wait -- go back a few steps. Are you saying that -- that Caleb went to hell to find out how to get the ring back?",
        "Rafe: That's exactly what I'm saying.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, I can't even imagine. I would never want to know what that was like.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I'm about to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I would never ever, ever not want to be together.",
        "Ian: Good.",
        "Lucy: Is that what you thought? Is that what I made it sound like?",
        "Ian: I just don't want you to be disappointed.",
        "Lucy: I'm not disappointed. I love you. And I am so grateful for eve single special moment that we have together. And I wouldn't trade it for anything, not anything in the whole world. It's just this -- this Kevin thing, you know, it's a little hard to explain.",
        "Ian: Can I try?",
        "Lucy: Please.",
        "Ian: We're not kids anymore. And I think, you know, we always live our lives to its fullest. And getting here was quite a journey. I met a lot of people, a lot of people who will be with us, who will be in our hearts. I'm never going to forget Eve. And you and Kevin -- you had something remarkable. But that was yesterday. And I'm here now. And I will love you with everything that is me. But don't you apologize for your past. Not ever.",
        "Lucy: Not ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe, I can't believe that you would -- that you would risk doing this, that you would want to travel down the same path that Caleb -- I mean, straight to hell.",
        "Rafe: It's an option.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. It's a very bad option.",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right. You know what, then let's explore the others. What do you want me to do? You want me to continue to let you cozy up to Caleb until that psychotic bride of his gets rattled enough that she steals the ring herself?",
        "Alison: That's what we agreed to in the beginning.",
        "Rafe: Ok, but you said he's on to you, right?",
        "Alison: He might be. What if he's not?",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right. Here's another option. We do nothing. We just sit back, let Caleb and Livvie have the ring. Is that what you want?",
        "Alison: Come on! I mean, this is a suicide mission! You can't do this!",
        "Rafe: It's not. No, Alison --",
        "Alison: Rafe, it is.",
        "Rafe: No, I can take care of myself.",
        "Alison: Listen to me. You -- I know that, believe me. But look at what we have. You and I have -- we've really gone through a lot. Look at this warehouse, ok? It was completely abandoned. There was nothing here, but together, you and me -- we created something out of nothing. You know, we put our -- our love and our energy and our hard work into this place. We've created a home. And we started a business that's just about to take off. And what about all the stuff that's supposed to come in the future -- our wedding and our babies and everything else? I can't risk it. I won't do it. I can't, and you just want to go waltz off and -- and to do all this stuff, and I can't. I won't do it.",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok.",
        "Alison: I can't do it.",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: I won't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: What's wrong?",
        "Caleb: I don't know. I thought I sensed something.",
        "Livvie: Yeah? Like what?",
        "Caleb: Oh, it's nothing. I -- I must have been wrong.",
        "Livvie: Good.",
        "Livvie: Ok, Livvie, stop thinking about it. I promised Caleb no more.",
        "Caleb's voice: You were always nice to me, Alison. You gave me a chance when no one else would. If this is what you want, I'll give you my ring.",
        "Alison's voice: Thank you.",
        "Caleb's voice: I trust you. I trust you like no one else.",
        "Alison's voice: I know you've entrusted me with your family ring. I promise you, I will not let you down.",
        "Caleb's voice: You might want to be more careful with that in the future. You wouldn't want to lose such a -- a lovely charm.",
        "Livvie: Oh, stop it.",
        "Livvie: Perfect, perfect. The fake that he gave Alison.",
        "Livvie: Hi.",
        "Caleb: Hi.",
        "Livvie: Is everything ok?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, everything's ok.",
        "Livvie: Good. Because I have a little surprise for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Do you know if none of this had happened -- if Kevin had never changed, I still believe that we would have found our way to each other because I believe with everything that's in me that we belong together.",
        "Ian: I think you're right.",
        "Lucy: I'm always right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Rafe, I think -- yeah, I think our original plan will work -- you know, with Caleb and everything. I think I was just a little bit paranoid, that's all. Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Really?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. And I know that you don't -- I know that you really don't want to hear this, but I sort of see a vulnerable and sad side to Caleb. You know, I do, and it makes me feel bad when I'm not being genuine with him.",
        "Rafe: Oh, my god.",
        "Alison: Look, hear me out, though, on this part, at least this much. I think that if this whole \"friends\" thing works with him --",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh --",
        "Alison: I think that I can make him see how damaging this ring can be to people in their lives.",
        "Rafe: So what are you going to do, you just going to ask for it? Because you tried that already.",
        "Alison: I know. And I shouldn't be wanting to try that again, but I feel like I should because I think things have changed a little.",
        "Rafe: You think they've changed?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. I feel like it really matters to him what I think. I -- I do.",
        "Rafe: Can we please just talk about this in the morning?",
        "Alison: Ok. Yeah, I'll stop.",
        "Rafe: Thank you.",
        "Alison: I'm -- I'm going to be right back, ok?",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: Ok? Ok?",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Ok. I've got to get that ring, and I've got to get it myself.",
        "Rafe: \"Father, I'm here. Share with me your wisdom. Let me reclaim what's ours -- our ring, our legacy. It is my right to have it back. It's my right as your son.\"",
        "Alison: What are you doing? What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: You take such good care of me. Tonight, just let me take care of you.",
        "Caleb: That feels good.",
        "Livvie: Just relax. Lose yourself in my touch.",
        "Livvie: I want to be the only one to ever touch you like this."
