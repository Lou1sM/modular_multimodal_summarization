        "Eve: Michael -- Michael, don't do this. ",
        "Livvie: No, Caleb, stop. ",
        "Eve: Let him go, Michael. ",
        "Livvie: Listen to me, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Limb from limb, Olivia. I'll tear him apart. ",
        "Eve: Michael, please -- ",
        "Caleb: And everyone else, all the others. ",
        "Livvie: No, you won't. I'll go with you, Caleb. ",
        "Alison: Livvie, no! ",
        "Caleb: Well, well, well. The gang's all here. Perfect. ",
        "Kevin: It's over, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, no, Dad. It's just beginning. ",
        "Eve: Michael, don't do this. Don't let this happen. ",
        "Caleb: Michael's not here anymore! ",
        "Livvie: I'll be yours, Caleb. ",
        "Kevin: No, Livvie. ",
        "Eve: Michael, please. This is your life. ",
        "Caleb: Shut up! ",
        "Eve: This is your soul! ",
        "Caleb: Shut up or he dies! ",
        "Livvie: No, no, Jack! Please, stop! ",
        "Caleb: Oh, you can't protect her now, Dad. You can't protect her now. It's \r\ntoo late for all of you! ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, let Eve get to Michael. She's the only one who can. ",
        "Livvie: No! Caleb, stop! ",
        "Kevin: Listen to me. It's Jack's only chance. ",
        "Eve: He won't let this happen. He won't let you hurt anyone else -- not \r\nagain. Not Jack, not anyone. ",
        "Caleb: Watch me! ",
        "Eve: Fight him, Michael. Fight him. I know you can hear me. ",
        "Caleb: Infants can survive outside their mothers at 7 1/2 months, Eve. Maybe \r\nI should end this right now. ",
        "Eve: Come to me, Michael. I need you. ",
        "Caleb: Reach in and take what I want. ",
        "Ian: I can't let this go on much longer. ",
        "Lucy: You have to. Just let Eve bring Michael out, and I'll shoot. ",
        "Eve: Remember, we met by the monastery -- ",
        "Caleb: The monastery you burned to the ground? ",
        "Eve: That was Caleb's doing. Caleb destroyed it. ",
        "Caleb: Think about it, Eve. A child with eyes as red as flame and teeth as \r\nsharp as razors. ",
        "Eve: The monastery was -- ",
        "Ian: It's not working. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, listen. Listen to his voice. I think it might be. It sounds \r\nlike it's changing some. ",
        "Michael: Eve. ",
        "Eve: Michael. Michael -- that's it, Michael. Open your hands. Let him go. ",
        "Caleb: No. No, I don't want to hear any more about Saint Michael. ",
        "Eve: I believe in you, Michael. I know you're not a saint, but you're still \r\nmy friend. ",
        "Caleb: No! ",
        "Eve: And I know your soul weeps when Caleb destroys. ",
        "Caleb: Shut up! Shut up! ",
        "Eve: Your heart is pure. Your soul is your own. ",
        "Caleb: No. ",
        "Eve: Come to me, Michael. Come to me. ",
        "Michael: I'm here, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Michael. I knew you'd come. ",
        "Michael: I would do anything -- ",
        "Ian: Careful, Lucy. ",
        "Michael: I would give anything -- ",
        "Ian: Make sure it's Michael. ",
        "Michael: Even my life. ",

        "Ian: All right. Shoot as soon as I move her. ",
        "Michael: I'm not Caleb. ",
        "Gabriela: Caleb's here. You're Caleb. ",
        "Michael: You're wrong. ",
        "Gabriela: Let Caleb through. ",

        "Chris: You know something? You'll be first on my list, Scanlon. ",
        "Karen: Hey, hey, hey. Chris, if you're looking forward to biting someone, I \r\nhave some bad news for you. ",
        "Chris: What? ",
        "Karen: All your vitals are perfect. Well, close to normal, anyway. ",
        "Chris: What do you mean? I'm not showing one symptom of, you know, vampire \r\nbehavior? ",

        "Alison: So, do you guys feel any better? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Actually, I -- I think I do. ",
        "Jamal: I guess the guy at the vampire shop was right -- big bat dies, \r\neverybody else turns back to normal. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, normal. I don't know what I would've done without you guys. Every \r\ntime I lost my way, you guys were always there for me. ",
        "Jamal: That's what friends are all about. Right, Spunky? ",
        "Alison: Right. ",

        "Alison: Yeah. Jamal, you go ahead, ok, because I'm just going to go call \r\nNana. I kind of just want to hear her voice, you know? ",
        "Jamal: Ok. ",
        "Alison: And then I'm going to stop by the chapel to say thank you. ",
        "Jamal: See you guys over there? ",
        "Livvie: Actually, I -- I'm going to catch up with my dad first, but we'll \r\nmeet you guys there, right? ",

        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: In the chapel? ",

        "Karen: Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: So, you ok? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know. It's kind of like waking up from a nightmare. I don't \r\nknow if that's good or bad. ",
        "Jamal: It's good. Good. Trust me. ",
        "Gabriela: I know you tried really hard to get through. ",

        "Kevin: Jack, I -- I -- I don't know what to say. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Makes two of us. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you didn't give up. And I can only imagine how hard you had to \r\nfight not to become what Caleb wanted you to be. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I would say there was definitely something worth fighting \r\nfor. ",
        "Kevin: For a long time, you were the only thing standing between my daughter \r\nand hell. I don't even know how to thank you for that. ",
        "Lucy: Hey, you know what? I -- I have a pretty good idea. For starters, we \r\ncould leave these two alone just to be together for a little while, and why \r\ndon't we go someplace and just try and thank the universe for getting us through \r\nthis, huh? ",
        "Kevin: You're a wise woman, Ms. Kovich. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, can't I just be, like, plain old Lucy Coe tonight? ",
        "Kevin:  Plain?  Old? I don't think so. ",
