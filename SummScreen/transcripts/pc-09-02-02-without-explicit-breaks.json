        "Livvie: Frank.",
        "Frank: From the look on your faces, you've heard Ian\u2019s theory that I\u2019m\r\nthe host. Lancelot\u2019s is using my body.",
        "Rafe: A lot of names have come up, frank.",
        "Frank: Don't worry about it. It's ok. I\u2019m not going to sue anybody.\r\nBesides, I heard the avatar is gone. Is that right? You know what happened?",
        "Rafe: It was a fire. We think it was caught in it.",
        "Frank: Well, just as long as we're all safe again. How you feeling?",
        "Livvie: I\u2019m all right.",
        "Frank: Your wife is one of those women who just glows when she's pregnant.\r\nIt's almost like there's a fire inside you.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, speaking of fires, can you wait here a minute? I\u2019ll be\r\nright back.",
        "Livvie: But, Rafe --",
        "Rafe: No, I just want to go run over to G.H. And see if I can check out the\r\nforensic reports on whatever was left in the ashes.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know, but, honey --",
        "Rafe: Something wrong?",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Frank: Don't worry about Livvie. I\u2019ll keep her company.",
        "Rafe: Thanks, Frank.",
        "Livvie: Rafe -- Rafe?",
        "Rafe: Hour tops, ok?",
        "Livvie: See you soon.",
        "Frank: Maybe you'll see him again. Then again, maybe you won\u2019t.",
        "Kevin: Livvie lied to me, and not just about these test results. I mean about\r\neverything.",
        "Lucy: She is a very, very complicated girl.",
        "Kevin: \"Complicated\"? Is that what you call it? Because I don\u2019t.\r\nI don't need a file or a test result to tell me what's been there right from the\r\nvery beginning. My daughter's losing her mind, Lucy, and all the signs have been\r\nthere since the start. And to hell with anyone who gets in her way.",
        "Lucy: I\u2019m so, so sorry.",
        "Kevin: Well, I\u2019m not going to hide from it anymore. This ends right now.\r\nThis ends right now.",
        "Alison: Please, god, I just need one more sign. Just one more sign.",
        "Lucy: Rafe's soul is lost forever -- unless you make him fall in love with\r\nyou again.",
        "Alison: But is that right? I mean, do you really want me to fall in -- or\r\nhave Rafe fall in love with me again? Shouldn't I just walk away? Shouldn't I\r\njust walk away and let him spend his life with his wife and this child that's\r\ncoming? I mean, there is a new baby on the way. Is it up to you to save his\r\nsoul? I don't know. Please, god, if -- if you can hear me, just reach out to\r\nhim. Please. God, I pray, just save his soul, please. Just save his soul.\r\nPlease.",
        "Rafe: Save whose soul, Alison?",
        "Alison: Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I\u2019m sorry. I didn't mean to --",
        "Alison: Oh, No. No, No, you're ok. You weren't interrupting.",
        "Rafe: Ok. So you were praying to save --",
        "Alison: A soul. My -- a friend of mine who's in a lot of trouble right now.",
        "Rafe: So you came here.",
        "Alison: I was -- I was on my way to go surprise my nana with some lunch, but\r\nI -- I took a detour here.",
        "Rafe: I\u2019m sorry. It's just that's -- it's the same detour I take every time\r\nI come to the hospital. It's like this is the only place that I -- I feel\r\ncomfort and calm. I feel --",
        "Alison: Peace.",
        "Rafe: Peace. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, let's just hope that you know who up there knows about\r\nthis little chapel down here and heard me.",
        "Rafe: I have a feeling he hears everyone.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Rafe: Especially someone with a heart and soul as pure as yours.",
        "Alison: Do you think that it belongs to you?",
        "Rafe: What's that?",
        "Alison: Your soul. My soul, anybody's soul. Do you think that it's really\r\nyours to keep or to give away?",
        "Rafe: I -- I don't know. I mean, I think the soul is really the essence of\r\nwhich somebody is, so I don't know how you could just give something like that\r\naway.",
        "Alison: What if somebody came to you and said, \"you need to give your\r\nown soul away in order to save someone that you really love\"? What if the\r\nlife of someone you love depended on you sacrificing your own soul? Would you do\r\nit if you could?",
        "Rafe: I guess, yeah, I could think of a moment where I would do anything if\r\nit meant saving somebody I loved.",
        "Alison: Yeah? Anything?",
        "Rafe: Sure. Yeah. You?",
        "Alison: I would just hope that if I was ever in that position that I would\r\nchoose the right thing to do.",
        "Rafe: You seem to have some doubts. But I got to tell you, there's not a\r\nquestion in my mind. Look at that.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Rafe that -- that candle. I -- I brought it in here months ago.",
        "Alison: Wait, did you just -- did you just say \"months ago\"?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And it's still burning.",
        "Frank: The avatar isn't gone, Livvie. He's just taking a little vacation.",
        "Livvie: How did you --",
        "Frank: Livvie? How did I escape the flames? Oh, you people are so limited.\r\nYou've seen what I am capable of but you still underestimate me.",
        "Livvie: No. No, I've never --",
        "frank: No, of course you do. Livvie, you treat me like that poor husband of\r\nyours you so desperately want to hang on to. Of course, his tragic flaw is\r\nbelieving you and the lies you've told him. Especially this one.",
        "Livvie: Don't touch me.",
        "Frank: Oh just a little late for that, don't you think?",
        "Livvie: Listen, frank, you don't want anyone to find out that you're the\r\nfather of this baby or that you're the avatar because everybody loves Frank\r\nScanlon --",
        "Frank: Frank Scanlon is gone, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Frank: More or less. I've grown so strong in his body, so powerful in this\r\ntown. It won't be long before what's left of him disappears completely. You're a\r\ntreacherous woman, Livvie, and I will have my justice on you. You will pay for\r\nwhat you've done. You may not know how or when, but I promise you it's coming.\r\nBut in the meantime, as I said to your noble husband, this pregnancy truly\r\nagrees with you. You look swell.",
        "Alison: Where did you find this? This is Kevin's candle.",
        "Rafe: What do you mean, Kevin's candle?",
        "Alison: Never mind. Where did you find this?",
        "Rafe: I found it in the w. I could pretty much show you the spot. I mean, it\r\nwas out there in the middle of the trees. Obviously it didn't seem like it\r\nbelonged, so I -- I just picked it up and -- I don't know why -- I couldn't get\r\nrid of it.",
        "Alison: Couldn't?",
        "Rafe: Well -- see, I think I heard this little voice inside my head that told\r\nme that maybe it could help you or, you Alison maybe it was a way that had\r\nsomething to do with helping you. And that sounds crazy, doesn't it?",
        "Alison: No, not to me. Not at all.",
        "Rafe: The day that Livvie and I were supposed to leave town, I came here. I\r\ndon't know. I was just saying good-bye or something, and then -- and I lit it,\r\nand then I just had this incredible, overwhelming feeling that I finally did\r\nwhat I was supposed to do the whole time.",
        "Alison: And then?",
        "Rafe:Then nothing. Well, I mean, I just haven't thought about it since -- at\r\nleast not until now. You thin means something, though, Alison. What is it?",
        "Alison: It means everything. Rafe, this changes everything.",
        "Rafe: I don't -- what -- did I say something? What did I do?",
        "Alison: I just have to go. I have to go.",
        "Rafe: Go where?",
        "Lucy: What do you do next?",
        "Kevin: Well, any shrink worth his couch would tell you, \"look at the\r\nfile.\" All the signs are there. It makes perfect sense. Forget about Caleb\r\nand all that stuff. Just take a look at the gene pool. Let's see if I have\r\nenough fingers, shall we? There's grace, Rachel, Estelle --",
        "Lucy: Ok, I understand --",
        "Kevin: And don't forget my side of the family. Lest we forget my twin brother\r\nRyan serial killer.",
        "Lucy: Let's forget about Ryan. Ryan is best left completely forgotten, ok?",
        "Kevin: I\u2019m just telling you what a shrink would do. That's the question,\r\nright?",
        "Lucy: Yes, that's what I asked you. But now I\u2019m asking you something else,\r\ndoc. What would a father do? What -- what\u2019s Dad say?",
        "Kevin: I don't know. I don't know what I would say. But it will have to do.",
        "Lucy: Do you want me to go with you?",
        "Kevin: Yes. But I thin know this is something I take care of alone.",
        "Lucy: Are you sure?",
        "Kevin: I can't remember how many times you warned me about it and I\r\ncouldn\u2019t listen. I\u2019m sorry. You were right all along.",
        "Lucy: I -- I did not want to be right. Believe me, I kept hoping and hoping\r\nthat I was completely wrong.",
        "Kevin: I know.",
        "Lucy: M so sorry you have to go through this.",
        "Kevin: I\u2019m sorry I let Livvie come between us.",
        "Lucy: She didn't, doc. She didn't. We will get through this just like rough\r\neverything else -- anger than ever, really.",
        "Kevin: Just like always.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I promise. Promises, promises.",
        "Kevin: Do you know how much I love you?",
        "Lucy: Well, I don't know. If it's anything like how much I love you --",
        "Kevin: No about three times as much.",
        "Lucy: Oh, No, No, No. See, that would be impossible because then you would\r\ncompletely explode.",
        "Kevin: Ooh. O",
        "Lucy: Hey, is there anything I can do at all?",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Just be there when I get home.",
        "Lucy: You can count on that.",
        "Kevin: I do, and I always will.",
        "Lucy: Always?",
        "Kevin: Always. I\u2019ll see you later. Lu ok. Ok. It's going to be ok.",

Let\u2019s see if I offered enough cash. He said anything was available\r\nfor the right price.\n\r\n[Knock on door]\n\r\nLivvie: Ok, I guess -- guess the price is right. Come on in.",

        "Man: Great. Nice doing business. But if anybody asks -- Livvie, I know. Never\r\nyour face, don't know your name.",

        "Frank: Go ahead. Talk.",
        "Livvie: You, I'd rather do it face to face. And I'd come to you, but I don't\r\nthink you want us doing this in public. Meet me at my apartment.",
        "Frank: All right, mommy, I can spare five minutes. Any tricks, though, and\r\nthey will be the last five minutes you see.",
