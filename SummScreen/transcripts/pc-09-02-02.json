My soul, anybody's soul. Do you think that it's reallyyours to keep or to give away?", "Rafe: I -- I don't know. I mean, I think the soul is really the essence ofwhich somebody is, so I don't know how you could just give something like thataway.", "Alison: What if somebody came to you and said, \"you need to give yourown soul away in order to save someone that you really love\"? What if thelife of someone you love depended on you sacrificing your own soul? Would you doit if you could?", "Rafe: I guess, yeah, I could think of a moment where I would do anything ifit meant saving somebody I loved.", "Alison: Yeah? Anything?", "Rafe: Sure. Yeah. You?", "Alison: I would just hope that if I was ever in that position that I wouldchoose the right thing to do.", "Rafe: You seem to have some doubts.

Livvie, you treat me like that poor husband ofyours you so desperately want to hang on to. Of course, his tragic flaw isbelieving you and the lies you've told him. Especially this one.", "Livvie: Don't touch me.", "Frank: Oh just a little late for that, don't you think?", "Livvie: Listen, frank, you don't want anyone to find out that you're thefather of this baby or that you're the avatar because everybody loves FrankScanlon --", "Frank: Frank Scanlon is gone, Livvie.", "Livvie: What?", "Frank: More or less. I've grown so strong in his body, so powerful in thistown. It won't be long before what's left of him disappears completely. You're atreacherous woman, Livvie, and I will have my justice on you.

Where did you find this?", "Rafe: I found it in the w. I could pretty much show you the spot. I mean, itwas out there in the middle of the trees.

And that sounds crazy, doesn't it?", "Alison: No, not to me. Not at all.", "Rafe: The day that Livvie and I were supposed to leave town, I came here. Idon't know. I was just saying good-bye or something, and then -- and I lit it,and then I just had this incredible, overwhelming feeling that I finally didwhat I was supposed to do the whole time.", "Alison: And then?", "Rafe:Then nothing. Well, I mean, I just haven't thought about it since -- atleast not until now. You thin means something, though, Alison. What is it?", "Alison: It means everything.
