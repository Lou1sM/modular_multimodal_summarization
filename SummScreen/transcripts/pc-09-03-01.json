        "Karen: I'll check you out just in case. ",
        "Ian: It's too soon, Karen. ",
        "Eve: I know it's too soon. It's definitely too soon. My water just broke. ",

        "Ian: Can you please go to the loft and get us some things just in case? ",
        "Lucy: No, Ian, that's ok. I'll go to the gift shop. I really need to shop \r\nnow. ",
        "Eve: Listen, everybody. Forget about my stuff. Don't worry about my stuff.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Look, whatever you need, Ian, I'm here. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Her robe is on the bathroom door. And, Frank, can you call the labor \r\nroom, make sure it's ready? ",
        "Karen: Ian, Ian, listen to me. I need you to be the daddy here, not the \r\ndoctor. ",
        "Ian: I'm not just going to sit here and -- and be the daddy. ",
        "Frank: Ian, Ian, you know that she's in good hands with Karen, all right? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",

        "Kevin: Who? ",
        "Karen: The neonatal specialist. She should be standing by just in case. The \r\nfront desk has her number. ",
        "Kevin: I'll do it. ",
        "Lucy: Good. ",
        "Kevin: See you later. ",

        "Ian: It's too soon, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's -- it's ok. It's ok. ",
        "Jamal: Hey -- for what it's worth, I was two months early myself. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and look at him now. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: That's not -- right. Father. How are you? ",
        "Father Vicente: I'm well, thanks. ",
        "Ian: Ok. My wife, Eve, she's having a baby. She's having our baby boy, and \r\nI'm a little -- I've got -- can you say a prayer for us? ",
        "Father Vicente: Of course. We'll all say a prayer. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, next time we see you, you'll be a daddy. ",

        "Eve: I told you the baby was coming. Nobody believed me. ",
        "Frank: We do now. ",
        "Karen: Well, your water breaking was a pretty good sign. ",
        "Eve: That's not a good sign. It's too soon. This shouldn't be happening yet.\r\n",
        "Karen: Eve, lots of babies are born early. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, six weeks is not that early. Are you ok? You all right? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: Do you want an epidural? You feel like an epidural -- ",
        "Eve: No. ",
        "Ian: No? ",
        "Frank: You sure? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. If I can vanquish a vampire, I should be able to -- oh! ",
        "Ian: Where's Dr. Miranda? ",
        "Kevin: We're still waiting to hear. ",
        "Colleen: I've tried every number I've got. Here. ",
        "Karen: Well, let's start trying some others. Ok, we need a neonatologist in \r\nhere right now. ",
        "Eve: That's bad. The baby's in danger. ",
        "Ian: No, no, it's just precaution. ",
        "Karen: Ian's right, Eve. No need to panic. ",
        "Eve: Right, right, you're right. I know you're right. ",
        "Lucy: Positive thoughts. You know, that's what I always say, Eve -- Doc, \r\nright? Positive thoughts. It'll help. ",

        "Eve: Sure. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I want to come in. Are you sure we're not imposing? Oh, this is \r\ngreat, you know. I'm just so excited. In a few short hours, you -- ",
        "Eve: Hours? ",
        "Lucy: Minutes, minutes -- just minutes -- there'll be a whole new life in the \r\nuniverse. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, a whole brand-new family! ",
        "Lucy: And it's going to be such a wonderful, cute, perfect family, you and \r\nyour little baby. ",
        "Ian: Wait, wait, wait -- I just remembered something. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: We're not a family, not the way we thought. ",
        "Eve: What are you talking about? ",
        "Ian: Well, if Michael's not a real priest, it means the ceremony was not a --\r\n",
        "Eve: Oh, my God! We're not really married! ",
        "Ian: No, we're not. ",
        "Kevin: But that's no big deal. You can just have another ceremony after the \r\nbaby's born. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, a great big one and invite us, and I can buy a new dress. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: I guess that would be ok. It's just -- ",
        "Ian: No, it was important to us that our son be born into a real family. ",
        "Eve: But we are a real family. ",
        "Lucy: Right. You just don't need some silly piece of paper to prove it. ",
        "Ian: It's not about a piece of paper, Lucy. It's about what it stands for. I \r\n-- I don't want our son thinking for one moment that we didn't have the \r\ncommitment to each other, ok? ",
        "Eve: Right. And you know what? We're going to tell him just as soon as we get \r\nthe chance. ",
        "Ian: As -- as soon as we get the chance? You're not listening to me. ",
        "Eve: No, you don't understand. There's a little more pressing commitment that \r\nI have to deal with right now! ",
        "Ian: Ok, ok, just breathe. Just breathe. ",
        "Eve: Ok! ",
        "Frank: The contractions are getting closer. ",
        "Karen: Colleen, let's prep her for delivery. ",
        "Colleen: I'm on it. ",

        "Lucy: Oh! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I'm sure everything's going to be just fine. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I know. It's just I'm so excited, but I kind of feel bad at the \r\nsame time. Ian -- he's going on and on about how they're not married and they \r\nreally wanted to be before they had the baby. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know. After everything they've been through, it's really \r\nkind of a shame. ",
        "Lucy: There's just really no time, is there? ",
        "Kevin: Well, no. She's in labor. ",

        "Jack: Are you sure you're not still worried about Caleb? Yeah, you are. ",
        "Livvie: I guess I am. ",
        "Jack: Hey. You don't have to be. It's over. Caleb's gone. You have to start \r\nthinking about us -- me and you, our future, and how much I love you. ",
        "Livvie: I love you, too. ",
        "Jack: Our love is what beat him, and don't you forget that. All right? We \r\nwon, and nothing is ever going to come between us. Promise. ",

But \r\nout in the ocean there are thick clouds galore, with monsters and dragons where \r\nthere were none before. And the bright sea has turned to the color of stone, with \r\nyoung Daniel out in the waves, all alone. Then he feels someone's hand on his \r\nfurrowed, cold brow, the touch, soft and calm, brings him back to the now. 'Oh, \r\nMother,' he cries, 'if you knew where I've been.' 'I do, my young Daniel,  and \r\nit was only a dream.'\" ",
