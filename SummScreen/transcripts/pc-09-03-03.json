        "Determined not to cry over Rafe's apparent trip to hell, Alison goes to the barn. Keeping himself unseen and unheard, Caleb follows her around the barn as she berates herself for going to the vampire and forces herself to have faith. Rafe learns that he is in hell, and that he's not wanted there. An unseen force knocks him around and warns that he has made a very big mistake. Realizing that Alison may be in danger, he begs for her safety. Alison decides to go to hell and bring him back. Her plan is unsuccessful until she manages to remember Rafe's exact words and actions. The barn door flies open as she completes the incantation. To test the ring, Olivia wishes for a glass of lemonade, which immediately appears on the table beside her. Returning home early, Caleb gives her the ring from his hand and urges her to make a wish, but she refuses. To keep him from making one for her--and finding out that his ring doesn't work--Olivia gives in and wishes for him to make love to her. Afterward, Caleb accuses her of giving his ring to the slayer. Although she protests that he's crazy, Caleb raises a stake over her, prepared to destroy her. Olivia wakes up screaming; it was a nightmare. Angry and disappointed that she still hasn't told him the truth, Caleb commands her to sleep. He removes the ring from her pocket but then decides to put it back. He's giving her one final test, and it will determine her fate."

        "Alison: I'm not going to cry. I'm not going to. I'm so sick of crying. It's time for me to do whatever I can. Caleb's not going to help me. I should never have even asked.",
        "Caleb: You're right, Alison. That was stupid.",
        "Alison: I will never make that mistake ever again.",
        "Caleb: I'm pretty sure you will.",
        "Alison: Rafe made his way back from heaven, and I know he's going to make his way back from hell, too. I just have to believe. Yeah, if I believe that I have enough faith, then maybe my faith will move mountains. It has to. Rafe? Rafe! Rafe? Rafe? Ok, now, wait a second. I know that that wasn't just a coincidence. That gust of wind didn't just blow that door open. Rafe, you have to come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Oy. Where am I? What the hell? Oh, god. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. This was the plan. This was my plan. Yeah, I need the answer. I got to figure out how to get the ring. It's ok, Alison. It'll be ok. Everything's going to be all right. Oh, this is better. This is much better.",
        "[Rafe gasps]",
        "Rafe: Ok --",
        "[Rafe groans]",
        "Rafe: I get it! You don't like me down here! Well, why don't you tell me to my face? Come on, present yourself to me!",
        "Voice: You've broken the rules, slayer.",
        "[Rafe laughs]",
        "Rafe: That's funny, because you know what? I didn't think there were any rules down here.",
        "Voice: My rules.",
        "[Rafe groans]",
        "Rafe: All right, all right. You can keep coming at me, but I'm not going to leave here until you tell me about the ring!",
        "Voice: Rafe Kovich, vampire slayer, defender of light, you've made a very big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Caleb would be very angry if he knew how I tricked him. But I'm only going to keep you for a little while. Besides, he never uses you to make wish anyway, so he'll never even know that you're gone. Ok, let's see. Just got to make a wish and I'll see how it works, right? Ok. Here goes nothing. All right, it's really hot out, so I guess I could use a glass of lemonade. All right. I wish I had a glass of lemonade. It works. All of my wishes are going to come true. It works.",
        "Caleb: You really think so, Olivia?",
        "Livvie: Caleb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Caleb. I thought you were at the studio.",
        "Caleb: No.",
        "Livvie: Well, you're home pretty early.",
        "Caleb: Yeah.",
        "Livvie: Honey, you look tired.",
        "Caleb: You look startled.",
        "Livvie: I'm just surprised to see you, that's all.",
        "Caleb: Really? Sure there's nothing more?",
        "Livvie: I -- I was half asleep on the couch. I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Caleb: I heard what you said.",
        "Livvie: Really? Um, I must've been daydreaming or something. I don't remember saying anything.",
        "Caleb: About making your wishes. Good lemonade.",
        "Livvie: I was thinking out loud. That's exactly what I was thinking about then -- making wishes come true. And you do. You make all mine come true.",
        "Caleb: Oh, how I try.",
        "Livvie: Yes, you have, and I want to do the same thing for you. You know that, right? I want to make all your wishes come true.",
        "Caleb: Well, not such an easy thing to do with someone who has everything. Isn't that what you always tell me?",
        "Livvie: Oh, I wouldn't exactly say everything.",
        "Caleb: No?",
        "Livvie: All of me -- all the time, anytime, whenever you want.",
        "Caleb: So there's no reason to make any wishes then, is there, because, well, I have all of you all the time, anywhere.",
        "Livvie: If you want something more, you know how much I want to please you.",
        "Caleb: I know. Maybe we could talk about the ring, then.",
        "Livvie: Alison was really stupid to come here and ask you to make a wish for her.",
        "Caleb: I'm talking about you, Olivia.",
        "Livvie: Me?",
        "Caleb: Yes. You and my ring. I -- I want you to have a little look at something, ok? I want you to take a very, very close look at the ring. What do you see?",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry. I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Caleb: I know you do. I know you do, sweetheart. That's what makes this so difficult. I want all your wishes to come true, so I'm going to do something I never do. I want you to take my ring. Give me your hand. Don't be afraid. I want you to take my ring, and I want you to make a wish. Don't worry. The ring never fails.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why is it all of a sudden so cold in here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Me coming here -- it might seem like a mistake, at least to you, but I had no choice.",
        "Voice: You should've listened to Alison.",
        "Rafe: What are you talking about? What does Alison have to do with this?",
        "Voice: You should never have left her.",
        "Rafe: Ok. If me coming back here has put her in some kind of danger, then send me back, ok? I'm sorry. I -- I shouldn't have broken into Caleb's home. I shouldn't have done the incantation. I'm sorry. Just punish me, ok? Do whatever you want to me! Just please leave Alison alone. Please leave Alison alone, please. Please. Come on, where the hell are you? Answer me!",
        "[Rafe groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I feel so helpless. I feel so totally helpless. I can't do anything. And I know that you think you did the right thing, and I get that, but I really feel like you should be back by now. You've been gone an awfully long time. What if you never come back? Don't do that. Don't do that, Alison. Don't do that. Think about -- think about Rafe and the last time you guys were together.",
        "Alison's voice: Rafe, I can't believe that you would risk doing this, that you would want to travel down the same path that Caleb -- I mean, straight to hell.",
        "Alison: Of course. That's what I have to do. Listen, I know you're probably not going to like this, Rafe, but I don't think I have any other choice. I have to do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: She is not in danger. So you know what? So, pal, it's not working!",
        "Voice: You have traveled to a place you know you don't belong, expecting to get something you know isn't yours.",
        "Rafe: That's not true. I never wanted the ring for myself.",
        "Voice: So you say. But once in your hands, do you think you could avoid the temptation to use the ring, to make just one wish?",
        "Rafe: Yes. Yes, I have seen the consequences. Now, just tell me, tell me how to have it in my possession, and I will bring it back to you.",
        "Voice: You will make another trip here, leave Alison alone again for the sake of the ring?",
        "Rafe: You have a very short memory. I was willing to spend eternity here. I sold my soul to save Alison, and you know what happened? The second we were together, we saved each other. Her belief in me -- it never wavered. So there's nothing you can do. No torture, no lies, nothing that will make me doubt our love.",
        "Voice: Then you clearly don't understand the power of the ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Don't be afraid. Make a wish.",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Caleb: Why not? It will come true.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, that's not the point.",
        "Caleb: What is the point, Olivia?",
        "Livvie: It's not my ring to make a wish on.",
        "Caleb: Oh. One wish. Anything your heart desires. Come on, Olivia, you can do that, can't you?",
        "Livvie: I guess I'm just a little afraid, that's all.",
        "Caleb: You have nothing to fear.",
        "Livvie: I think you know that there is something.",
        "Caleb: No. Tell me. What could you possibly be afraid of?",
        "Livvie: I don't want you to do anything that's against your nature.",
        "Caleb: So you're doing this for me?",
        "Livvie: Yes. You have told me again and again that the ring is not to be used for foolish wishes, that the power is in possessing it, just as you possess me. And you would never take advantage of me.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. You never cease to amaze me. You know that?",
        "Livvie: It's only because you're such a good teacher. You know I learn from the best.",
        "Caleb: Oh.",
        "Caleb: I'd like to do something for you. Break with my rules, prove to you how strong my love is for you. Let's see. I wish --",
        "Livvie: No, no, hey -- look, I want to do it, ok? I'll make the wish. I wish that you would make love to me.",
        "Caleb: That's funny. I don't feel anything.",
        "Livvie: Come on. Of course you do. You feel my lips, don't you?",
        "Caleb: I feel your lips.",
        "Livvie: And my body next to you?",
        "Caleb: I feel your body.",
        "Caleb: Don't you know, Olivia, this is the one thing you never need to wish for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Just gets better and better, doesn't it? I love making love to you.",
        "Caleb: You are good.",
        "Livvie: We are good together.",
        "Caleb: Not anymore.",
        "Livvie: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: You gave my ring to the slayer, didn't you?",
        "Livvie: No. No, I kept it for us to make our love stronger.",
        "Caleb: I wouldn't have been angry if you would have done that. But to deceive me by giving it to my enemy --",
        "Livvie: No, that is crazy! Caleb, you have to believe me. That's crazy.",
        "Caleb: You must understand, Olivia. You know what I must do now.",
        "Livvie: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Hey? Are you ok?",
        "Livvie: I was having a nightmare.",
        "Caleb: What were you dreaming about?",
        "Livvie: You were leaving me.",
        "Caleb: Hey -- why would you ever have a dream like that?",
        "Livvie: I don't know. I don't know, but I don't think I can go back to sleep. Please, just hold me.",
        "Caleb: I will. You just need to sleep. You've had a tough night, sweetheart. A very tough night. Here, just close your eyes. There. Takes a lot of energy to lie like that.",
        "[Caleb sighs]",
        "Caleb: I gave you every chance to tell me. I could've forced it out of you, but I didn't. All I wanted, all I needed, was for you to tell me the truth. Did you really think I wouldn't know? Did you think I couldn't tell the difference?",
        "Caleb: This will be your real test, sweetheart. You can either give me the ring back or deceive me one more time and make that fatal wish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Just answer me! What does the ring have to do with her?",
        "Voice: The fate of everybody will soon be tied to the ring.",
        "Rafe: No. No, not Alison. She wants nothing to do with it -- or you or anything down here!",
        "Voice: How little you know, slayer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ok, you can do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What are you trying to tell me? What's Alison doing?",
        "Alison: Father of evil, hear my plea. I will do anything -- and I mean anything -- to be with Rafe. I choose to follow Rafe wherever he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Voice: What are you feeling now for your sweet Alison?",
        "Rafe: She's in trouble. That's what I'm feeling. She is in a lot of trouble. What in the hell have you done to Alison?",
        "Voice: I have done nothing. Look to yourself, slayer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This isn't working. Think, Alison. Think really, really hard. What were the exact words that Rafe used? What did he say?",
        "Rafe's voice: Father, I'm here. Share with me your wisdom. Let me reclaim what's ours -- our ring, our legacy. It is my right to have them back. It's my right as your son.",
        "Alison's voice: What are you doing?",
        "Rafe's voice: Father, I'm here. Share with me your wisdom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: No, Alison. You have to stop, please. Whatever it is you're doing, stop.",
        "Voice: She couldn't stop you, could she?",
        "Rafe: No. No, Alison, please. Stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Help me reclaim what's ours -- our ring and our legacy. It's my right to have them back. It's my right to have them back as your son. Rafe, let me come to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, you win. Just forget it! Forget the damn ring, ok? Just send me back to Alison, please! Just send me back!",
        "Voice: Too late, slayer. Much too late.",
        "[Rafe groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe's voice: Alison!"
