        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Eve: Hey. ",
        "Ian: Why don't you try to get some rest? ",
        "Eve: I'm afraid if I stop looking at him -- ",
        "Ian: He's going to be all right. ",
        "Chris: Eve. Hey, I just heard. ",
        "Eve: Chris. Hey. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to stop by and see you after \r\nyour run-in with Caleb. ",
        "Chris: Oh, stop, it's ok. Guess you were kind of busy, right? How's he doing?\r\n",
        "Eve: Well, I haven't been able to hold him and he's a little small. But he's \r\na fighter. ",
        "Ian: Dr. Miranda's running some tests. ",
        "Chris: Well, if this kid's anything like his mother, I'm sure he'll be \r\nbossing you two around in no time. ",
        "Eve: I can't lose him. ",
        "Ian: Doctor, what's the news? What's wrong with our son? ",
        "",
        "Alison: Look, Jamal, I said that I was sorry. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you got to understand that Gabby, she's a part of my family now.\r\n",
        "Alison: Yes, and I will -- I will try harder. ",
        "Jamal: I know you don't trust her or anything, but she's been hurt, too, ok, \r\nand I'm not going to turn my back on her. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, I just don't want you to get hurt if things don't work out.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Ali, listen. I'm not expecting this to be all Brady Bunch-y or nothing \r\nlike that, ok, but I'm going to be there for Gabby no matter what. ",
        "Jack: Hey, guys. ",
        "Jamal: Yo. What up? ",
        "Alison: Where's Livvie? ",
        "Jack: She's running errands, but she'll be by later. ",
        "Alison: How is she doing? ",
        "Jack: She's a little shaky but ok, I guess. ",
        "Alison: What do you mean, you guess? ",
        "Jack: It's just weird. Livvie thought that Caleb's ring appeared on her \r\npillow last night after she threw it away. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you can't blame her for still feeling all freaky. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I just want her to feel good again, and I have no idea how to \r\nhelp her. ",
        "Man: I found you. Dude, you can't just tell me that there's a vampire in town \r\nand leave me hanging. ",
        "Jamal: Look, dude, I'm working right now, ok? ",
        "Man: Well, just give me the scoop and I'll go. ",
        "Jack: You heard him. He's busy. ",
        "Man: What are you, like, his mouthpiece? ",
        "Jack: Get the hell out of here, man! ",
        "Man: It's you, isn't it? You're the big bat. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Well, I just hate waking up and finding you gone. ",
        "Lucy: Ooh. I'm sorry. I just -- I got up so early and I thought I'd pop over \r\nhome, you know, and get some of my things. ",
        "Kevin: Any news on Eve and Ian's baby? ",
        "Lucy: No. No, not yet. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'll drop by later and check in on them. After last night, I \r\nthought you would've slept in a bit. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you know, you would think that after escaping a fiery inferno and \r\nwatching a vampire be vaporized, I'd sleep like a log. ",
        "Kevin: But? ",
        "Lucy: It's nothing. I had a really bad dream. ",
        "Kevin: About Caleb? I'm sure you're not the only one, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm sure. It's just I think mine had to be the absolute worst.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe it would help if you got it off your chest. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, thanks. I don't really want to talk about it. ",
        "Kevin: Now, I thought there wasn't anything you couldn't tell me. ",
        "Lucy: Well, there's not, but I don't want to talk to you about this. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, tell me. ",
        "Lucy: The dream was about Livvie and Livvie being pregnant with Caleb's baby.\r\n",
        "",
        "Dr. Miranda: Do you want to speak in private? ",
        "Eve: No, Chris can stay. ",
        "Ian: What's wrong with our boy? ",
        "Dr. Miranda: It's good news. His lungs are a bit underdeveloped, but they're \r\nin good shape. In due time, they should function normally. ",
        "Eve: Thank God! ",
        "Chris: That's wonderful. ",
        "Dr. Miranda: No, but there's still a problem. We discovered that your son has \r\nsleep apnea syndrome. ",
        "Ian: But that's treatable, right? Is it not? ",
        "Dr. Miranda: With sleep apnea, a child can have short periods when he's not \r\nbreathing. ",
        "Eve: But it's not dangerous? ",
        "Dr. Miranda: Right, right. It's the longer periods we have to worry about.\r\n",
        "Ian: So, what, we need a monitor for home? ",
        "Dr. Miranda: I've already ordered one. In the meantime, we're monitoring him \r\nhere. ",
        "Eve: And he's going to be ok? ",
        "Dr. Miranda: I think he'll be fine. He'll probably outgrow this. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Ok, so, when -- when can we take him home? ",
        "Dr. Miranda: Well, he's ok now, but just to make sure, I'd wait until \r\ntomorrow. ",
        "[Pager beeps] ",
        "Dr. Miranda: Oh, sorry, folks. I got to get up to O.B. We'll talk later. ",
        "Eve: Oh, but -- ",
        "Ian: Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Bye. ",
        "Chris: Eve, you see there? He'll be fine. Sleep apnea is scary for parents, \r\nbut it is manageable. ",
        "Ian: Thanks for your support, Chris. ",
        "Chris: You bet. I'll keep a good thought. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Well, that's a huge weight off my chest. What's the matter? ",
        "Eve: Didn't it seem like she was keeping something from us? Like she didn't \r\nwant to let us down? ",
        "Ian: No, she seemed as relieved as we were. ",
        "Eve: No, but she just rushed out of here like she didn't want to answer any \r\nmore questions. ",
        "Ian: She was paged to an emergency. How many times have we -- ",
        "Eve: Right, and how many times, as doctors, have we told a patient that, \"We \r\nthink you're doing just fine,\" when we really weren't sure? ",
        "Ian: Eve, what are you doing? ",
        "Eve: Thornhart, you got to level with me. We're going to lose him, aren't we?\r\n",
        "",
        "Jack: I'm not a vampire. I'm not the big bat. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Jack, why don't you calm down? ",
        "Jack: No fangs. And, hey, what do you know -- a reflection. So sorry to ruin \r\nyour day. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to throw you out. ",
        "Man: Well, you sure are acting like a -- ",
        "Alison: Look, look, there are no vampires in Port Charles, ok? Jack is \r\ntelling the truth, and we're not saying another word. ",
        "Man: There is something going on here, and I think you owe it to me to tell \r\nme. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I appreciate the books and everything, but later. ",
        "Man: And you're covering something up, and you're protesting way too much.\r\n",
        "Jack: Look, get out of -- get out of my face, man! ",
        "Man: I am not -- ",
        "Jamal: Hold back, dude. ",
        "Man: Judging you, but I've devoted my entire life to studying vamps. I just \r\nwant to know the deal. ",
        "Jack: I don't give a damn what you want. You just stay the hell away from me.\r\n",
        "Alison: Um, we have some lovely muffins today. ",
        "Man: Jeez, man, that guy is wrapped tight. I was just trying to help. ",
        "Jamal: How? How? By bugging him? ",
        "Man: Weren't you trying to ice the master vampire? Well, it's not as \r\ncut-and-dried as you think. There's some things that you should know, or you're \r\nstill looking at a whole load of trouble. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Oh, God, Lucy. Just the thought of my daughter being pregnant by \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm so sorry. It's probably nothing. You know, just watching \r\nCaleb turn to dust, and then Eve and Ian's baby on the way -- it probably all \r\ngot mixed up in my head. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, nonetheless, this is an image I'd like to repress. ",
        "Lucy: I know. Me, too, but I -- I can't control my dreams. ",
        "Kevin: You're right. You're right. I'm sure we're all just dealing with the \r\naftermath of Caleb's death, and talking about it is healthy. Lucy, this is -- \r\nthis is something I don't want to be shared with Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: No. Of course not. I would never breathe a word, Doc. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Kevin: Kevin Collins. Ok. I'm on my way. That's the office. I have to go. \r\nLucy, remember, it was just a dream. A very bad dream. ",
        "Lucy: And I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ",
        "Kevin: It's ok. I love you. ",
        "Lucy: I love you. Ok. See you. ",
        "Lucy: How long have you been standing there? ",
        "Livvie: Long enough. I came in through the den. Your dream that I was \r\npregnant by Caleb -- God, Lucy, what if that's true? ",
        "",
        "Eve: There's something you're not telling me about our baby. ",
        "Ian: Where's all this coming from? You heard the doctor. ",
        "Eve: Be honest with me, Thornhart. ",
        "Ian: I've always been honest with you. You do trust me, don't you? ",
        "Eve: With all my heart. ",
        "Ian: Ok. I'm telling you that our son is going to be fine. ",
        "Eve: Do you promise? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Wouldn't break a promise to you or to the wee one. We'll take care \r\nof you. And as soon as you're ready, we'll take you home. ",
        "Eve: Somehow I think he understands. I just -- I want so much for him. ",
        "Ian: Hey. Come here. He's going to be fine. We'll be a family. ",
        "Eve: I want to hold him. ",
        "Ian: Just a little while, ok? ",
        "Eve: But I'll believe that -- I'll just know that he'll be ok if I can just \r\nhold him. I just want to hold him. ",
        "Ian: All right. If that's what you want, I'll make it happen. You'll hold \r\nyour baby. If I have to move heaven and earth, you'll hold your son. Ok? ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Man: Are there vampires here in Port Charles? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. There were. ",
        "Man: Cool! How many? What happened? ",
        "Jamal: There was one, ok? He was living down at the catacombs. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, and he sort of bit a few people. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but when he died, they all went back to normal, just like you \r\nsaid. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, so see? There's a happy ending to our story. Unless you think \r\nthat there's more? ",
        "Man: Vampires don't just up and die. It's not that simple. ",
        "Jamal: Well, this one got blown to bits right in front of our eyes. ",
        "Man: Yeah, but they always leave behind a -- like, a kind of residue. This \r\ndisturbance in the force. It can really mess you up. ",
        "Alison: Wait, you mean they can still affect you even when they're dead? ",
        "Man: Exactly. This residue -- it can't kill anybody, but it can really mess \r\nup the people who've been bitten. It's like vamps -- they leave these little \r\nmental time bombs for their victims, and they can go off when you least expect \r\nit. Boom! ",
        "Jamal: Look, but Caleb -- he didn't go down easy. ",
        "Man: And you can be sure he left a little something behind. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Are you saying it's actually possible you could be pregnant with \r\nCaleb's baby? ",
        "Livvie: Well, I -- I slept with him, Lucy. I was out of my mind. What am I \r\ngoing to do? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, I'll tell you what we're not going to do. Livvie, really, we're not \r\ngoing to panic here. ",
        "Livvie: What if I have some demon seed growing inside of me? ",
        "Lucy: No, we're also not going to jump to creepy conclusions. ",
        "Livvie: Well, can you please just tell me about your dream? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, why don't we sit down, have some breakfast?",
        "Livvie: No, Lucy, please tell me what happened, please. ",
        "Lucy: What happened was a -- a horrible bad dream. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Lucy, just tell me, please. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. All right. You know what? Here it goes -- I -- I was dreaming that \r\nI came home, and you were sitting in this chair, but it wasn't that kind of \r\nchair. It was a rocking chair and you were rocking back and forth. And you were \r\nsinging. ",
        "Livvie: Singing. ",
        "Lucy: A lullaby. And I walked over and I looked down at you and I could see \r\nyou were pregnant. And then you looked up at me and you said that you were \r\ncarrying Caleb's baby. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. God, Lucy, I think I'm going to be sick. ",
        "Lucy: No -- Livvie, listen. It's just my wacky, insane reaction to fear of \r\nlosing someone to some winged thing, someone I care about very much. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no. But your dreams always have meaning, right? ",
        "Lucy: No. No. Absolutely not. Not always. Besides, didn't we learn? Caleb \r\ncan't have any children and that's why he wanted Eve's baby. Come on. ",
        "Livvie: No, but what if he was wrong or he was lying? This dream has to mean \r\nsomething. Maybe that's why I've been feeling so strange. Maybe I really am \r\npregnant. ",
        "Jack: We're having a baby? ",
        "",
        "Nurse: He's a beautiful baby. ",
        "Ian: That he is. ",
        "Nurse: Ready? ",
        "Ian: I've been waiting for this moment all my life. ",
        "Ian: Hey, there, little man. Don't be nervous. You're about to meet the most \r\nbeautiful woman in the world. Say hello to your mother. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: So, Kibble promised not to say anything about our little brush with \r\nthe vampires. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, if Caleb can still do damage, even when he's dead -- I mean, \r\nstill, like, really mess with our minds -- ",
        "Jamal: Look, I think maybe Kibble's been reading way too many spooky books. I \r\nmean, he knows his stuff -- don't get me wrong -- but he -- he's a little out \r\nthere. ",
        "Alison: I mean, it makes sense. It would explain why we are all so jumpy. ",
        "Jamal: We just went through this big war. Ok, that's the reason why we're on \r\nedge. It's as simple as that. ",
        "Alison: You heard what Jack said, ok, about Livvie seeing Caleb's \r\ndisappearing ring and all of that. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Caleb can only mess with us if we let him. ",
        "Alison: You saw Jack just about take Kibble's head off. Right, and you remember \r\nhow he reacted when I said the whole comment about the super-strength thing. \r\nSomething is really, really wrong. ",
        "Jamal: I know, and it's time we make them right, ok? It's time that we just \r\nput things back to normal, you know? ",
        "Alison: Jamal, stop. Please, don't do this. Don't -- don't pretend that this \r\nisn't affecting you. Ok, don't play Mr. Cool because I saw you last night. You \r\ngot up four times in the middle of the night to check the door, make sure it was \r\nlocked, ok? I counted. ",
        "Jamal: Look, Caleb terrorized us for months. Ok, he made our lives a living \r\nhell. I'm not going to let this guy play us from the grave. It's over. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I hope that you're right. But I'm scared to death that you're \r\nnot. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Chris? Any word on Eve's baby? ",
        "Chris: Well, it just turns out he has sleep apnea. He's going to be fine. ",
        "Kevin: That's good news. It's a good thing Caleb never got anywhere near that \r\nchild. The sooner we put all this behind us, the better. ",
        "Chris: At least we have the research, too. ",
        "Kevin: No. Frank and Karen destroyed all the blood materials in the lab. \r\nThere's no evidence of Caleb or anyone like him was ever here. ",
        "Chris: Wait -- what are you talking about? Why would she do that? She had no \r\nright. Who knows what kind of scientific advances we could've made? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I get it. After what everyone's been through, you're still hoping \r\nto profit from it? ",
        "Chris: It's called progress, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: What is it with you? You were bitten. You almost lost your soul, or is \r\nthat redundant? ",
        "Chris: I'm sorry. You're right. I guess I just got a little carried away. \r\nIt's good that all this vampire data is gone. It would only bring up bad \r\nmemories. ",
        "Kevin: Well, we can all move on now that everything's been destroyed. ",
        "Chris: Not everything, Kevin. Not everything. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Did I hear you right? We're having a baby? ",
        "Lucy: No. No. We weren't talking about that -- why would we -- no, of course \r\nnot. We weren't talking about having a baby. ",
        "Jack: Lucy, I know what I heard. What's going on, Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Jack's right, Lucy, no more lies. Um -- yeah, I -- I admit I was \r\nwondering if I just might be pregnant. ",
        "Jack: Wow. Oh, my -- I mean, I thought we were careful. You're not talking \r\nabout us. You're talking about Caleb. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I am so sorry. It seems like I -- I always wind up hurting you \r\nand I hate that. ",
        "Jack: No. It's ok. I know what happened happened because Caleb had a hold on \r\nyou. ",
        "Livvie: God, I can't believe this is happening -- how stupid I've been. ",
        "Jack: But I thought Caleb couldn't have children. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, he said that, Jack, but he's told so many lies. I don't even \r\nknow what's true anymore. Now, what if I am carrying Caleb's baby? What if there \r\nis something evil growing inside of me? ",
        "Jack: No. Livvie, don't even think that. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Hey, you two, come on. We're jumping way ahead of ourselves. \r\nYeah, we don't even know if this is possible at all. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I have to know, Lucy, because if it's true, if there is a part \r\nof him still with me, I have to know. ",
        "Lucy: I'll tell you what. I'll run out and I'll get you a pregnancy test, ok?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
