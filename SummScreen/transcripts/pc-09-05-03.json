        "At Elixir, Jamal overhears Imani speaking on the phone to her grandmother, who is very much alive. Imani is alarmed by the news that someone has been asking questions about her. When Jamal accidentally drops the newspaper clipping that he took from Imani's things, his angry roommate picks it up. She reluctantly tells him a little about her past. The murdered man was her professor, who was a very nice man. She didn't kill him, but Jamal's actions may end up getting her killed. Now knowing exactly what she wants from the ring, Olivia orders a lobster dinner as part of the romantic evening she's planning. After an argument with Jack prompts Olivia to wish that he didn't hate her anymore, Jack watches her through the window, buys a single red rose from a flower vendor, and takes off early. A man with a gun looks through a folder about Imani. Rafe is informed that being stuck in hell is the price he must pay for his arrogance. The slayer learns that he has changed the future by violating a sacred code. Choosing to go to hell was the defining moment of his life. He is responsible for what happens now, and he will have to live with the consequences for all eternity. Filled with remorse, Rafe finally admits that he was wrong to put his desire to fight vampire before Alison. He was sent back to earth specifically to be with her, and that's exactly what he will do if he gets another chance. Amused by the imminent consequences of Rafe's actions, the speaker sends him back home. Overjoyed to be home at last, Rafe waits for Alison and vows not to fight Caleb anymore.",
        "Alison tries desperately to persuade Caleb to help her, but he refuses. Alison is touched by his admission that both she and Olivia have betrayed him. After feeling a shift in the balance of good and evil, Caleb tells Alison that Rafe is back. Alison throws her arms around Caleb, fully believing that he did this for her. As Olivia waits for Caleb to come home, she makes her big wish on his ring. She wishes for this to be the most romantic evening that Caleb has ever known. She wishes for him to feel the kind of passion he's only dreamed of. She wants this to be a night of intense love that Caleb will never forget, and she wants him to always know that she is the one who made it happen. As Olivia makes her wish, Caleb's night of intense passion begins--with Alison."

        "Jack: Yeah, hold on a second. Imani, it's for you.",
        "Imani: Hello? Grandmother, what's wrong? Are you sick? Madea, you're not supposed to call here unless it's an emergency. Who's asking questions about me? Ok, grandmother, listen to me. Do not talk to anyone. And don't call here again. I know, I love you, too. Soon. Soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Come on! Show your face! Come on, what are you afraid of? So, you know Alison tried to -- she tried to get down here to be with me. But she couldn't. For some reason, she couldn't. So guess what -- you lose!",
        "Voice: Think again, slayer. She may be safe for the moment, but you're stuck here. So who's the loser?",
        "[Voice laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie's voice: Just let me take care of you. Just relax. Lose yourself in my touch. I want to be the only one to ever touch you like this.",
        "Caleb: I just need d to be patient.",
        "Alison: You know, the only thing that I can think of is that that isn't your real ring.",
        "Alison: Caleb, answer me. I was touching your ring when I made the wish for Rafe to come home, but it didn't work.",
        "Caleb: It's something you never should have done, Alison.",
        "Alison: Look that ring is supposed to grant every single wish, no matter who's touching it. But it didn't work because that is not your real ring, is it? My god, that's a phony. That means that Rafe isn't coming back. So where is it? Caleb, where is your real ring?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Livvie: Once I get everything set up for tonight, it'll be perfect. Then I can finally make my wish.",
        "Imani: Can I get you something?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'd like something to go, something special --",
        "Imani: It's you. Would you mind taking her order?",
        "Jack: I got it. So, I see you make friends wherever you go.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you should be glad I'm giving you my business. I would like two large lobster tails and some Caesar salads and some rice and veggies on the side, please, to go -- now.",
        "Jack: Big occasion?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you have no idea.",
        "Jack: So, who's the victim?",
        "Livvie: Oh, god. You don't know me anymore, do you?",
        "Jack: I know you well enough to know you're up to something tonight. It's written all over your face, Livvie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: What am I up to? If you must know, Caleb and I are in for a very romantic evening tonight. And I think you should be kissing my feet for bringing you my business because, you know, I'm a really good customer. I could be going somewhere else. But not you. You like to, you know, attack your best customers.",
        "Jack: Whoa, I'm not attacking you, I'm just calling it like I see it.",
        "Livvie: Oh, right, Jack the truth teller.",
        "Jack: Yeah, truth teller. Would you like some dessert for your lovely evening? Maybe we can get some cheesecake. Maybe you can rub it all over yourself and have Caleb lick it off -- after your intellectual conversation.",
        "Livvie: You're still trying to convince yourself you don't have a thing for me, huh?",
        "Jack: How come it is every time I bust your chops, you accuse me of having a thing for you?",
        "Livvie: It's so exhausting hating you.",
        "Jack: Every guy needs a reason to get up in the morning. Hating you happens to be mine. I'll be back.",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe it doesn't have to be that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Where is your real ring, Caleb? Look, you have to get it!",
        "Caleb: Ordering me to do something will get you nowhere.",
        "Alison: Ok. You're right. I'm sorry. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound that way. I really didn't. But if I let you leave, then Rafe -- he might not ever be able to come back.",
        "Caleb: Then again, you can't keep me here, either.",
        "Alison: Ok. All I'm asking is that you just do not disappear. Ok, please, look at me. I don't have anything else to say to you. I can't make any more promises to you. All that I am left with is my love for Rafe, and I have to hope that's going to be enough.",
        "Caleb: You know, I might actually be enjoying this if it wasn't such a bittersweet pill to swallow. I have been betrayed by the woman I love and the woman who swore to me she was my friend.",
        "Alison: I promise -- I promise, I won't do it again. I promise you, I will keep that promise. Wait, did you just say the woman that you love betrayed you? Oh, my god. Livvie has your real ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok. Why don't you show me your face? They said it would be a fair fight.",
        "Voice: There's no fight here. I win, you lose. That's the price you pay for your arrogance.",
        "Rafe: What? Arrogance? I didn't choose to be a slayer! This was my destiny! The only thing I want is to end the curse of this ring!",
        "[Voice laughs]",
        "Voice: It's only those who never should have wished on the ring who are cursed and those, like you, who have come seeking it. In the hands of its rightful owner, the ring is a dutiful servant.",
        "Rafe: You are unbelievable! You're talking about this thing like it's almost human, like it has a will of its own!",
        "Voice: Do you really think humans have wills of their own?",
        "Rafe: Yes. Yes, we do! That is how we have survived so long. Because we have the will to choose good over evil!",
        "Voice: Not always. Just look at your world and all the wishes your friends have made.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Well, you know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe I can't change the past, but I can change the future!",
        "Voice: You already have.",
        "Rafe: What? What do you mean?",
        "Voice: You violated a sacred code. Making the choice to come here was the defining moment of your life. Your fate is sealed. And even if you could get the ring back now, it won't matter.",
        "Rafe: No. No. That's what you want us to believe! You make us do that, you make us doubt ourselves! You make us doubt each other! But I'm here to tell you that nothing is ever sealed!",
        "Voice: You let yourself believe that.",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Yeah, you know how I know that? Because I have seen it over and over again! Humankind has risen above the greatest tragedies!",
        "Voice: Let's see how well you do with this one, since you're now responsible for what's going to happen. You set the wheels of fate in motion, and you, Rafe Kovich, will have to live with the consequences for all eternity.",
        "Rafe: Ha! I fought your consequences. I'll do it again.",
        "Voice: What about Alison?",
        "Rafe: What about her, huh? Is that it? Is that the last card? Is that the only card that you and Caleb can ever play? Well, go ahead! Go right ahead! She is smart, she is strong, and she loves me. And together, we will survive.",
        "Voice: No, you will live to regret this journey. And it's just begun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: I know this looks kind of bad, Imani.",
        "Imani: You took this from my stuff.",
        "Jamal: No, I didn't take it from your stuff. I wouldn't do that.",
        "Imani: So rather than ask me about it, you tried to investigate me yourself?",
        "Jamal: Well, I just don't feel like I deserve to be lied to.",
        "Imani: What lies?",
        "Jamal: Like you trying to convince me that your grandmother's not alive. You not telling me where you're from, where you grew up, or anything like that.",
        "Imani: Well, did it ever occur to you that I might have a good reason for not spilling my guts?",
        "Jamal: Sure, yeah, and I tried to respect your privacy --",
        "Imani: No, no, you haven't. You have tried every way that you can to find out about me, things I don't want to share.",
        "Jamal: Imani, it's not just things. I'm talking about murder here. And it's freaking me out. Just try to understand, ok? I'm on your side. I just need some answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Bon appetite. Try not to choke on it.",
        "Livvie: Jack, it doesn't have to be like this, ok? We were polite to each other once. I think we can manage.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but it never lasts, does it?",
        "Livvie: That's because we always bring up the past, stupid stuff.",
        "Jack: Yeah, the stupid stuff you did to me over and over again. Bye.",
        "Livvie: Ok, so I've made a few mistakes. It doesn't mean Jack has to hate me. I wish that Jack didn't hate me anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb, can't you just get the ring back and help me get Rafe? Look, this war between the two of you -- it's killing everything that is good and that's real.",
        "Caleb: And still, she battles on.",
        "Alison: Because I have to. Otherwise, there's no point to any of this at all. I will continue to fight for Rafe, just like you will continue to fight for Livvie, no matter how much pain we're in.",
        "Caleb: You don't know anything about my pain.",
        "Alison: Yes, I do. Look at -- listen to me, just for a second. When you talked about the two women that you trusted betrayed you, Livvie and me, I saw something in you that touched me, and I think that you liked that.",
        "Caleb: This is all pointless now, all right?",
        "Alison: No, it's not. No, it's not pointless. I know you have other powers. You know things. You know dark secrets. And I know you can get to the place where Rafe is and you can free him from the curse. I know you can.",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry, Alison. It's out of my hands. Rafe's on his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison! I want to talk to you just about anything. Listen to me -- oh! I might never be able to talk to you again. Is -- is that it? Is that my fate? That I -- I'll just be away from her forever? Is that the best you can do? Well, you got nothing! Ok? You got nothing! You've got -- Alison -- oh, god, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done this. I was wrong! I was wrong! I was sent back to earth to be with you, not to fight vampires, not to find a way to beat Caleb! To be with you. That's what they said -- \"you're sent back to be with her.\" And Caleb was just a distraction. He was just a test, and if I get a chance, if I get another chance, I swear -- I swear I will live my life as it was intended to be lived. I promise you -- I promise you that I will -- I will be with you, just you and only you. If I just get another chance, if it's not too late. If it's not too late.",
        "Voice: You live in a world filled with empty promises, slayer. All good intentions in that world won't change your fate. You've picked your path. Now it's time to see where it takes you.",
        "Rafe: Well, what do you mean?",
        "Voice: For reasons that will soon become clear, I've decided to set you free. It's time to meet your future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Give me one red one.",
        "Woman: Ok.",
        "Jack: Please.",
        "Woman: Here you go.",
        "Jack: Thank you very much.",
        "Woman: Good luck.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Hey, Jeff, lock up, man.",
        "Jeff: Right, jack.",
        "Jack: I'm taking the night off.",
        "Imani: Yes, I knew the man in this article. The man who was murdered. He was my professor. English composition. He told me I had talent. I was flattered. At was the last thing that resembled anything normal in my life.",
        "Jamal: Were you in love with him?",
        "Imani: He was just a friend, just a really nice man. That's all.",
        "Jamal: Did you kill him?",
        "Imani: No. I didn't kill him. But you might have just killed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison? Alison! I'm here! It's over! She's not here, that's ok. I'll just -- I'll just wait for her, right here. Yes. I can't believe it. It's over. It's finally over. That's right. No more Caleb. No more fighting that battle. From now on, it's just you and me. That's right. And we are going to have everything we ever dreamed of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Caleb, what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to live like this?",

        "Alison: What? What is it?",
        "Caleb: I felt a shift. Rafe's back.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: It wasn't me, Alison.",
        "Alison: No, I don't believe you. I think you must have known. But it doesn't matter now. All that matters is that Rafe is back, and this time -- I swear we're going to do it right this time. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I wish for this to be the most romantic evening Caleb has ever known. I wish for Caleb to feel the kind of passion he's only dreamed of.",
