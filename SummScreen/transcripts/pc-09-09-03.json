        "Jamal tracks down Imani as she prepares to leave town. Imani informs him that he could have stirred up a lot of trouble by snooping around her past. When Jamal insists on knowing what's really going on, Imani says that her obsessive stalker is the one who killed her professor. Since the man is a cop, he managed to implicate her in the crime, and now he's free to hunt her like an animal. Jamal agrees to let her leave but states that he's going with her. When his back is turned, she takes off without a word. Meanwhile, the man who is after Imani refuses to give up on finding her. Alison tries to tell Rafe about what happened at the barn, but he is determined to put his slaying days behind him forever and forget that Caleb even exists. From now on, his only mission in life is to make sure that Alison is happy. Rafe and Alison are both ready to erase the past and start fresh. Alison stops before letting him make love to her, asking him to hold her instead. Pointing to her hand, she expresses the desire to get married as soon as possible, and Rafe has no problem with that. After Olivia claims that she would never hurt Caleb, he demands the immediate return of his ring. When she asks how he spent the night, Caleb taunts her with the idea that he was with Alison. He retracts this when she begs him to say it's not true, and Olivia swears that she's learned her lesson. After making love to Caleb, Olivia is stunned by his order to get out. Although she screams and clings to him, Caleb pushes her out and then closes the door in her face."

        "Jamal: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Imani: Jamal, what are you doing here?",
        "Jamal: Look, I went to the airport, I went to the train station. I finally found you.",
        "Imani: I didn't want you to. It's just better if I disappear.",
        "Jamal: Look, you said that I put you in danger. Ok, I was just worried about you, that's it.",
        "Imani: Listen, Jamal, listen to me, I witnessed a murder. The people who are after me? They want me dead, too. And those questions that you've been asking? They could stir up a whole bunch of trouble.",
        "Jamal: I know I shouldn't have been digging into your past, ok? I was wrong. But if you were just straight with me from the beginning, I wouldn't have had to do that, ok?",
        "Imani: Jamal, I don't want to go into this again. I am sorry that I snuck away, but you've got to let me go.",
        "Jamal: Imani, look, I'm not letting you go, not until you answer my questions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: It's ok. It's ok, see? See? I'm back, good as new.",
        "Alison: I can't believe it. I was so worried. I was -- I was worried out of mind, I mean, when you just, like, disappeared like that.",
        "Rafe: I know. It was stupid. It was a stupid thing to do, take a little side trip to hell, but believe me, I learned my lesson, all right?",
        "Alison: You're back now. You're back, and you're safe and sound.",
        "Rafe: Yes, and I am never, ever going to leave you again. Ok?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Alison: Um --",
        "Rafe: What? What's wrong?",
        "Alison: I need to tell you something. I need to tell you what I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I know it must have been a surprise for you to come home to see me on the couch with Jack asleep.",
        "[Caleb sighs]",
        "Caleb: You've been a bad girl, Olivia.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, you've said that, but, Caleb, we were just sleeping. You have to believe that.",
        "Caleb: Are you sure about that?",
        "Livvie: Yes. I was upset, and he was just being a friend to me. I swear on my love for you, that's all it was. What? Caleb, what are you thinking? Why aren't you talking to me?",
        "Caleb: I believe you.",
        "Livvie: I'm glad. Because I would never want you to doubt me in that way.",
        "Caleb: It's a terrible thing when the one you love doubts.",
        "Livvie: Yes, and you know I would never do anything to hurt you.",
        "Caleb: Wait a minute, run that by me again? The part about how you'd never do anything to hurt me?",
        "Livvie: It's true, Caleb. I belong to you and only you.",
        "Caleb: And I believe you have something else that belongs to me. I want my ring back, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Here it is, safe and sound. I've -- there it is.",
        "Caleb: I gave you every opportunity to tell me the truth.",
        "Livvie: I was going to, Caleb. I -- I set up this evening with dinner, and I was going to give you your ring back, but you never came home last night. Where were you?",
        "Caleb: You should know by now that I can take care of myself.",
        "Livvie: Yes, I know that. But you never have spent the night, the whole night out. Caleb --",
        "Caleb: Why did you take the ring? Wait. Don't tell me. You kept it because you wanted to make a wish.",
        "Livvie: I wished for something for you. I wished that you would have the most passionate night of your life, but you weren't with me.",
        "Caleb: Oh. A waste of a perfectly good wish.",
        "Livvie: I did it for you. Caleb, please tell me where you were last night, please?",
        "Caleb: What you'd really like to know is, who was I with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: What's wrong? You're -- you're shaking a little. You know, we don't have to talk about this anymore.",
        "Alison: No, no. No, no, no, we do. Ok, we do. Look, Rafe -- um -- when you were gone, my world sort of turned upside down and I was really out of my mind.",
        "Rafe: I know. I know. I know how worried you must have been. I know what it must've been like for you when I was down there.",
        "Alison: No, you have no idea. You don't.",
        "Rafe: Ok, but here's the thing -- when I was down in that dark pit, something happened to me, something changed in me. I mean, it's like my whole life flashed before my eyes, and I didn't see any vampires that I'd killed, I didn't see any battles I'd won. All I saw was you.",
        "Alison: Oh, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I want you. I want you in my life. I mean, that's the only thing that matters. Now, come here. My only mission in life now is to make sure you're happy.",
        "Alison: So are you saying that -- um -- nothing that Caleb says or does would provoke you in any way?",
        "Rafe: There's nothing that he can do that will concern me.",
        "Alison: Ok. That's really good because I have something to tell you. Um -- when you were gone, I went to Caleb to ask him if he would help you --",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, just stop, ok? I don't -- I don't to want to hear his name anymore.",
        "Alison: I need to explain something to you. Um --",
        "Rafe: It's ok. What, did he hurt you? Tell me he didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Look, Imani, I'm not trying to get you busted. Ok, you know I'm on your side no matter what, but you got to tell me the truth, ok? Were you involved with this murder in any way?",
        "[Imani sighs]",
        "Imani: The man who was killed -- he was my friend as well as my professor.",
        "Jamal: Ok. Was he just a friend?",
        "Imani: We weren't involved. But that didn't stop him from paying the price for being close to me.",
        "Jamal: So you're saying that this stalker guy is the one that killed your teacher?",
        "Imani: Yes, he's obsessed with me.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Imani: And if he can't have me, then he didn't want anyone to so much as even look at me. This murderer -- he killed him right in front of me, and he wanted me to watch so that I would know what would happen if anybody got close to me.",
        "Jamal: Ok.",
        "Imani: And to answer your question, yes, I killed him because I brought this animal into his life.",
        "Jamal: Imani, come on, this is not your fault.",
        "Imani: Well, it feels like it.",
        "Jamal: So that's why you've been keeping me at a distance all this time?",
        "Imani: Yeah, and if I have to keep running for the rest of my life, I will. To keep him away from me and the people I care about.",
        "Jamal: Ok, why don't you just go to the cops and let them lock up this guy behind bars?",
        "Imani: They don't -- they wouldn't believe me.",
        "Jamal: Why not? Come on.",
        "Imani: Because he's a cop!",
        "Jamal: Oh, my --",
        "Imani: He tampered with the crime scene, made it looked like I committed the murder. And now he can hunt me like an animal and, in the eyes of the law, he has every right.",
        "Jamal: Well, at least now I know what we're up against.",
        "Imani: \"We're\"? Jamal, this is my problem, and you have got to let me go.",
        "Jamal: Ok. I'll let you go. But I'm going with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Look, you know, Rafe, when you were gone, I was also living my own version of hell. Um --",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I --",
        "Alison: I just -- I tried to feel close to you in every way that I could. I mean, I really tried, but I couldn't feel you anywhere.",
        "Rafe: I know, I know. I really scared you, I know. And I'm sorry. My mind, it just -- I mean, I was doing anything I could to get that ring. I don't know how to explain it except it was almost like I was possessed.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, like you sort of got swept away in something that you never really wanted to be a part of.",
        "Rafe: Hey. Hey, what is it? What -- what's going on?",
        "Alison: Rafe, I just -- I never want you to leave me ever again, ok?",
        "Rafe: Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Uh-uh.",
        "Alison: Uh-huh.",
        "Rafe: My slaying days are over.",
        "Alison: You have no idea how glad I am to hear you say that.",
        "Rafe: That's right, that's right. As far as I'm concerned, Caleb Morley doesn't exist.",
        "Alison: Do you really believe that we can just erase the past and just start fresh?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Just watch me, ok? All right? Yes.",
        "Alison: And you believe that no matter what we've done or what's been to us, that being together is all that matters?",
        "Rafe: Yeah. That's exactly what I believe. I mean, you held on, you know? You stayed faithful to our dream. And now it is time to enjoy our future, ok?",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: It's just us. Just our future.",
        "Alison: No, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Who was she? Caleb, who were you with?",
        "Caleb: Who was she? Who was I with? Well, let's see. Who was I with? Who'd be your worst nightmare?",
        "Livvie: Alison? No. Caleb, no, you weren't with her. Please don't tell me you were with her.",
        "Caleb: What a brilliant way to get revenge on all three of you -- you, Rafe, and Alison -- three birds, one wish.",
        "Livvie: No. Uh-uh, no, it wasn't Alison.",
        "Caleb: I can't think of a better way to teach you a lesson -- me and your best friend together because of your wish.",
        "Livvie: Please, Caleb, please tell me it's not true! Please. Please. No, it's not true. Please.",
        "Caleb: Ok. It's not true. I wasn't with anyone.",
        "Livvie: Really? Really?",
        "Caleb: I sensed your wish. I knew what you were doing. I resisted.",
        "Livvie: Because it wasn't with me? Because there wasn't anyone else? Why? Why did you resist? Why?",
        "Caleb: It does seem that I always come back to you, don't I, no matter what you do. But even I have a limit to my patience, Olivia.",
        "Livvie: Love you. I love you, and I am so sorry. Can we just forget this night ever happened, please? Can we just go back to just it being the two of us?",
        "Caleb: Just like that?",
        "Livvie: Please? Caleb, please, I'll make it up to you, I promise. I'll make it up to you. Please, I've learned my lesson. I've learned my lesson about trust and wishes. I've only ever wished for you.",
        "Caleb: Don't you know? You don't have to make wishes when it comes to me, sweetheart. I always get what I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: You're the nicest guy I've ever met. That's why I can't let you come with me.",
        "Jamal: You ever hear that saying, \"when you look back on your life, you don't so much regret the things that you did, it's the things that you didn't do\"? I want to go with you. Good.",
        "Imani: Ok.",
        "Jamal: All right, so you just sit tight. I'll go buy a ticket and we'll be on our way. Ok? Um -- let's see. I guess it would help if I knew what time we were pushing out of here, huh?",
        "Clerk: That might help.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Imani, what time are we -- damn!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Man: Hello? Well, that's not the news I was hoping to hear. Well, keep checking the airports and the bus stations. You keep looking until you find her!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I just want you to hold me, that's all. I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: No. You don't have to be sorry. I love holding you.",
        "Alison: Good. Maybe later, ok?",
        "Rafe: You know, you have a right to be a little angry at me, you know, because even the king of hell said I was crazy to ever leave you. You know, he even had me going for a while. He said my life on earth would be worse than in hell because I left you here alone. If he could see us now, huh?",
        "Alison: You know, um -- sometimes -- sometimes we've made some mistakes without even realizing it.",
        "Rafe: What's wrong? You don't -- there's nothing you can't tell me.",
        "Alison: The problem is this, here.",
        "Rafe: Your hand?",
        "Alison: No, not my hand. I mean, do you see any wedding band there?",
        "Rafe: Oh. How did that happen?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Rafe: Hmm.",
        "Alison: But I feel like it's a problem, you know? I'm just wondering, when exactly am I going to become Mrs. Rafe Kovich?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. But I can definitely see the problem there. Let me think about that for a second. You know, I think I can -- I think I can definitely fix that for you.",
        "Alison: I just -- you know, I want to pledge our love to each other and I want to get married as soon as possible so that nothing and no one can ever come between us.",
        "Rafe: Oh. I see. No one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Hey, baby. Hi. You make me so happy. I'm happy things are back the way they were and I am happy you forgave me for taking your ring.",
        "Caleb: Then I guess we're both happy. Which makes this last time together so special.",
        "Livvie: Last time?",
        "Caleb: As usual, you were amazing. But now I want you to get out.",
        "Livvie: What are you talking about?",
        "Caleb: Am I not making myself clear? You see, that is what they call a door. Use it.",
        "Livvie: You're joking, right?",
        "Caleb: No. No more. No more life with a woman who lies to me and steals from me. It's over, Olivia.",
        "Livvie: Caleb, come on, I know that you're angry, but please --",
        "Caleb: I'm not angry. Do I seem angry?",
        "Livvie: I --",
        "Caleb: It's not anger. I'm disappointed.",
        "Livvie: I told you how sorry I was.",
        "Caleb: Disappointed in myself. I wanted you so bad, I didn't see you for you who you really are.",
        "Livvie: Who I really am is someone who loves you. I took that ring because I loved you.",
        "Caleb: It doesn't matter why you did it! You did it! I can't trust you anymore! Do you understand?",
        "Livvie: No, I'm not going anywhere! No, no, I won't let you destroy us. No! No, please.",
        "Caleb: Sweetheart, one way or another, you are leaving.",
        "Livvie: No! Please, Caleb, you're all I have! Don't do this to me.",
        "Caleb: Well, then, that doesn't leave you with much.",
        "Livvie: No, please."
