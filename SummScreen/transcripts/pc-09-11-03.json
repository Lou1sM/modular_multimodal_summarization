        "Finding Olivia crying on his doorstep, Jack invites her inside and listens as she blames herself for her misery. While he tries to comfort her, Jamal starts pounding on the door. Olivia ducks out of sight so that Jack can answer the door. Filling Jack in on the situation with Imani, Jamal urges him to pack a bag and help him find her. Jack is prepared to go until Olivia returns and begs him not to leave her. Jack assures Jamal that it's not what it looks like, and he fully intends to help look for Imani. When Jamal refers to Olivia as \"psycho,\" she advises him to take a good look at Imani before tossing that word around. Seeing that Jack is prepared to leave her there alone, she decides to accompany the guys in their search, but Jamal would rather do this alone than have her along. After he leaves, Olivia reluctantly fills a skeptical Jack in on her strange encounter with Imani. Meanwhile, at a diner, Imani rejects a potential suitor and calls Jamal, but she can't bring herself to speak. Convinced that it was Imani who called, Jamal thinks hard about where she could be, and he decides to start with her grandmother in Alabama. After leaving Kevin, Lucy runs into Chris, who is frantically looking for Ian. When Chris explains that Ian took a super dose of the serum, Lucy tries to blame him for this, but Chris informs her that she is the reason her lover stole the serum. A crazed Ian confronts Kevin at the hospital. After alternating between uncontrolled rage and tearful pleas for help, he gives in to his dark side. As Ian bares his fangs to kill his wheelchair-bound rival, Kevin throws a pot of hot coffee on him. Lucy arrives just as Ian prepares to smash a chair down on his enemy. While she distracts him and tries to talk him down, Chris manages to jab a needle into the raging vampire's neck."

        "Kevin: It's ok. I know a consolation prize when I hear one.",
        "Lucy: Ian and I are going to work this out. We're going to figure this out and we're going to be just fine. It's just every once in a while, I sort of lose my focus, you know, just, like, for a beat.",
        "Kevin: It's ok. You're entitled to do that.",
        "Lucy: Right. I need to go. So are you going to be ok?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, my ride should be here any minute.",

        "Jack: All right, all right, it's going to be all right, all right? Just relax. Tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Jamal: I don't know what happened, ok? Imani -- she just took off.",
        "Jack: And that worries you because?",
        "Jamal: Because she's in the middle of something right now, ok? It's just this crazy situation.",
        "Jack: Ok, like what?",
        "Jamal: This guy who's obsessed with her, he offed another guy, and he's basically trying to pin the whole thing on Imani.",
        "Jack: Ok, what kind of sick freak?",
        "Jamal: One with a badge and a gun, ok, insane, right, that kind of guy.",
        "Jack: Whoa, you telling me this is a cop?",
        "Jamal: He's a sheriff, which basically makes him untouchable.",
        "Jack: And if he finds Imani --",
        "Jamal: It's not going to be good, yeah.",
        "Jack: Why'd she leave anyway?",
        "Jamal: I was getting all in her business and I stirred things up again, ok?",
        "Jack: So she freaked out and left.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Look, I got to find her. Can we go now?",
        "Jack: Dude, ok, I'm in your corner, all right?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Ian, are you feeling all right?",
        "Ian: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. You know how hectic a blended household can be, especially when one of the members is a vampire.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I know you and Lucy have been having some problems with that.",
        "Ian: You spoke to Lucy, Lucy spoke to you.",
        "Kevin: Yes, she did, and she made it clear to me she wants to work through it with you.",
        "Ian: It's just us here, Kevin. Kevin Collins, Kevin Collins. \"Call me doctor, call me doc.\" It's just us. Will you play a game with me? All you have to do is tell the truth, and I will do the same. Ok, I go first. I think you wanted this from the very beginning. You wanted to try to find a way to maneuver yourself back into Lucy's life.",
        "Kevin: You don't seem to be feeling very well, so maybe --",
        "Ian: Maybe what? Maybe I should feed? I should feed. Ok. I can't show Lucy. I can't show her.",
        "Kevin: You can't show her what?",
        "Ian: What you've been whispering in her ear this whole time -- whisp, whisp, whisp, whisp. \"Ian is a vampire, and the day will come when he will do what comes naturally.\"",
        "Kevin: All I was going to suggest is that maybe you need a little help. I tell you what, why don't we just go page Chris?",
        "Ian: Why? It's just the boys talking. Just a friendly chat.",
        "Kevin: Look, Ian -- this isn't feeling too friendly anymore.",
        "Ian: Ok. You got me. You're right. Maybe I need to feed on you. You will feed me. It's what comes naturally. It's my instinct. You need to help me get in touch with my dark side. Please? Please?",
        "Kevin: Ian, whatever it is you feel like doing, whatever it is you want to do, I'm asking you, don't do it. Don't do it, and get a hold of yourself, not just for my sake but for Lucy'S.",
        "Ian: Always do what's best for Lucy! Always! Always! Kevin Collins, Kevin, Kevin, \"call me doctor, call me doc\"! Do not toy with me, boy! Do not pretend you have not dealt with the dark side.",
        "Kevin: Of course I have.",
        "Ian: And tell me, what did you do? Did you fight it like I did or did you embrace it?",
        "Kevin: Ian --",
        "Ian: Share with me, teacher! Share with me what you felt! Ah! The sweet, sacred sense of liberation when the darkness comes? Did you feel it? Because I have to tell you, in my whole life, I have never felt stronger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Excuse me, miss. I couldn't help but notice you sitting alone and --",
        "Imani: What do you want?",
        "Man: Well, I didn't mean to bother you. I just -- well, I'm new in town, and you're very attractive, and -- well, forgive me. I'm not very good at this.",
        "Imani: Listen, listen, I am really flattered, but I'm not from around here and I'm not really available.",
        "Man: Oh, well. Well, whoever he is, I'm sure he's a lucky guy.",
        "Imani: Thanks. Jamal, I miss you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Livvie? Dude, tell me this isn't what it looks like.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, Jamal, nothing's going on here, believe me, I promise.",
        "Jamal: So why is she even here?",
        "Jack: I don't know why she's here.",
        "Jamal: But you let her in.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: The woman you were going to hate for the rest of your life. You let her in.",
        "Jack: I did hate her.",
        "Jamal: But obviously not anymore. Ok, so tell me something -- I don't know, tell me, what changed here?",
        "Jack: I don't know!",
        "Livvie: Would you two please stop talking about me like I am not here?",
        "Jamal: Well, you know what, that's the question of the day, that's the question of the day, Livvie -- what are you doing here?",
        "Livvie: Jack is just being a friend.",
        "Jamal: A friend?",
        "Livvie: Is it really that hard to believe, Jamal?",
        "[Jamal laughs]",
        "Livvie: You were once my friend, remember?",
        "Jamal: Oh, no, no, no, no. That was a long time ago, before you flipped out and went psycho and tried to destroy --",
        "Livvie: I'm psycho?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you are psycho!",
        "Livvie: What about your girlfriend?",
        "Jamal: What, my girlfriend?",
        "Livvie: Why don't you take a good, hard look at Imani before you start throwing the \"psycho\" around.",
        "Jamal: Hold on, hold on, what do you think you know about Imani, anyway?",
        "Livvie: Plenty, trust me.",
        "Jamal: Well, come on.",
        "Livvie: No, forget it.",
        "Jamal: We're listening. No, no, we're listening.",
        "Livvie: Forget it.",
        "Jamal: No, no, you brought this up. What do you think you know about Imani?",
        "Livvie: When you find her, maybe you'll find out for yourself.",
        "Jamal: That's your friend? I don't need to listen to anything you say because I know they're all lies anyway. Now, if you're done, me and Jack, we got to go. Are you down with this?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Jamal: Can we move?",
        "Livvie: Jack, please, don't leave me. I need you.",
        "Jamal: God.",
        "Jack: Look, Jamal needs my help. I got to go with him.",
        "Livvie: Jack, I have nowhere to go. You cannot abandon me right now.",
        "Jack: Look, I'm going to go with Jamal. You stay here.",
        "Livvie: I cannot be alone!",
        "Jamal: Let's go, please?",
        "Livvie: I can't be alone right now. Don't you see? My heart is breaking. I have no one to talk to. Everyone has turned their back on me.",
        "Jamal: Oh, there you go.",
        "Jack: Livvie, go talk to your dad. You guys seem to have a good relationship now.",
        "Jamal: Yep, that's a good idea. That's good, go to your dad. Come on, Jack, let's go.",
        "Livvie: No, it is not a good idea! My father is trying to get himself better right now. I cannot worry him with my problems.",
        "Jamal: You know what, it looks like you got a lot to me. Jack, let's go. I got to go.",
        "Jack: All right, let's go.",
        "Livvie: No, wait, wait.",
        "Jack: Livvie --",
        "Livvie: Listen to me, I understand that you have to help Jamal. I just -- well, I want to come, too.",
        "Jack: Oh, no.",
        "Jamal: What?",
        "Livvie: Please, I will help! I just -- I want to come along.",

        "[Elevator bell]",
        "Lucy: Oh, Chris. Anything? Did you find him?",
        "Chris: I checked every floor up to this one. There's no sign of him.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my god. Ian, why? Why did you do this? Why did you take that drug? Why didn't you stop him? Why didn't you?",
        "Chris: I thought I'd talked him out of it.",
        "Lucy: You thought?",
        "Chris: Yeah, I told him the serum wasn't ready, and he seemed to accept that. But then when I turned my back, he must have taken it.",
        "Lucy: Why did you turn your back then? You knew what he was thinking, you knew what his state of mind was.",
        "Chris: Don't blame me for this. You're the reason he took it in the first place. Maybe if he hadn't felt so threatened by your live-in ex-husband, he wouldn't have done it.",
        "Lucy: Kevin -- Kevin doesn't live with us anymore, and Ian knows how much I love him.",
        "Chris: Well, between this whole vampire thing and Kevin waiting in the wings --",
        "Lucy: Kevin -- he's not waiting in the wings. He's not waiting at all.",
        "Chris: I don't know. Well, in Ian's mind, he's on stage, Lucy. That's what drove him over the edge. That's why he took the serum.",
        "Lucy: No, it's not. He took the serum because he wants to be normal for himself.",
        "Chris: No, he took it for one reason, and you're that reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Share with me, Kevin. Share with me, Kevin. Share with me, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Ok. All right. What would you like to know?",
        "Ian: How did it feel? How did the power feel rushing through your veins?",
        "Kevin: I felt hatred and anger. But most of all, I recall feeling dead inside.",
        "Ian: Oh, no, no, no. Well, you're better now. You're all better, and that's good, that's good, that's good, because now you can sit and look down in judgment on me. And you can fill Lucy's head with worries of the day when I finally snap!",
        "Kevin: I won't apologize for that.",
        "Ian: And that's fair. And I will not apologize for killing you. Say good night, Collins.",
        "[Ian yells]",
        "Lucy: No, Ian! Ian!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: You got to be kidding me, right? You're kidding me. Do you honestly think that I will go anywhere with you?",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to cause any trouble, Jamal, I swear.",
        "Jamal: Oh, my god.",
        "Livvie: Don't you understand? I cannot be alone right now.",
        "Jack: Livvie, Livvie, Livvie, listen to me, this is not about you. Jamal needs my help, so I've got to go.",
        "Livvie: I want to come, too!",
        "Jamal: You know what, you know what -- Jack, on second thought, I think I can cover more ground on my own, ok?",
        "Jack: No, Jamal, dude --",
        "Jamal: No, no, no, no, Jack, because you know what, you know she's not going to give this up. She'll probably end up following us and making the whole situation worse.",
        "Livvie: No, I won't, Jamal!",
        "Jamal: Stop, ok, because I've got to focus right now on one thing, and that thing is not Livvie.",
        "Jack: Hey, wait a minute --",
        "Jamal: Jack, just forget about it, ok? Just handle your situation.",
        "Jack: What is your problem? Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Livvie: Jack, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know you must hate me. I'm sorry. Jack, you're all I have right now.",
        "Jack: All right. Just calm down, ok? It's ok. Are you calm now?",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Jack: So what was the thing between you and Imani?",
        "Livvie: Jamal was right, Jack, it's nothing, really.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, look, I know when you're lying, so tell me the truth.",
        "Livvie: I'm not proud to say this. I was really upset one night.",
        "Jack: I'm sure about Caleb.",
        "Livvie: Jack, do you want me to tell you or not?",
        "Jack: Go.",
        "Livvie: Like I said, I wasn't in the best of moods that night when I ran into Imani. And I don't remember who started it, but she pushed me over the line. I bit her.",
        "Imani: Oh!",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You what? Are you telling me Imani's --",
        "Livvie: No, jack, that's just it -- she got right back up like nothing happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: Blood? I'm bleeding. You.",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Imani: Oh, baby, you just made a big mistake. I don't think so!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: And then she pushed me away. I'm strong, Jack, I'm a vampire, but she pushed me away like I wasn't even there.",
        "Jack: And then what?",
        "Livvie: That's it. She just insists that nothing happened. But I am positive something did. I know it. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Livvie: Jack, when I bit her, I got sick, I mean violently sick.",
        "Jack: So you're telling me you and Imani got into it, you bit her, she looked at you in a strange way, and because you didn't turn her into a vampire, you think she's a freak?",
        "Livvie: Fine. Ok, I over exaggerated a little bit. Sorry, I don like people looking at me that way. You know, Jack, fine, if you want me to leave, I'll leave. Just tell me.",
        "Jack: I said you could stay. I meant it. So stay.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Damn, was that you, Imani? If only I knew where you were at. Just if I had some kind of clue. Come on.",
        "Jamal's voice: There's got to be some kind of mistake. This is a sketch of you. Imani she seems like a really cool lady. You talk about her like she's still here.",
        "Imani's voice: I guess she's still alive in my heart.",
        "Jamal: That's it. That's where I'll start. I am coming to see you, Medea.",

        "Ian: You said it didn't matter.",
        "Lucy: It doesn't matter. You know that. And you know that I love you!",

        "Lucy: I'm sorry, but I know I can. Now, listen to me, look at me very carefully -- this isn't you. This is that drug. It's making you have all these symptoms. It's making you this way. Do you hear me?",
