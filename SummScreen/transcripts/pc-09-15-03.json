        "Not wanting to get involved with Olivia again, Jack pulls away from her embrace. After she admits to wishing that he no longer hated her, Jack tells her that she left him defenseless, because his hatred of her was the only thing standing in the way of his love for her. A crazed look on his face, Jack chases Olivia around the room, proclaiming his undying love and devotion. He smothers her face with kisses and asks her to marry him and have his babies. Scared, Olivia runs to the door, only to learn that Jack was teasing her. Unamused, she leaves Jack laughing about his little joke. Alison demands that Caleb somehow undo what they did at the barn, but Caleb informs her that he can't change the past. Caleb realizes that she still hasn't told Rafe the truth. Alison feels that she's in a no-win situation, since she can neither tell Rafe the truth nor keep it from him. Caleb understands that she's being tormented for something that isn't her fault; they are both paying the price for their lovers' obsessions. When he accuses Alison of having the hots for him, she slaps him hard. Caleb says that he is moving on, and he advises her to do the same. Alison vows to live happily ever after with Rafe. After she storms out, Caleb lingers at the door, confident that he's right about her feelings. When there's a knock at the door, he assumes that Alison has returned, but it's Olivia. Confused by Alison's behavior, Rafe comes home to an empty apartment and is soon joined by Elizabeth, who realizes that something is wrong. She is appalled by his idea to get married in a barn, but as he explains the barn's significance, she begins to understand. Rafe, however, silently concludes that Alison might have been upset about some unhappy events that also occurred there. Elizabeth admits that Rafe has Alison's best interests, and she knows that he can handle whatever is wrong now. When Alison comes home, Elizabeth leaves to give the couple some privacy. Rafe admits that he only thinks of good things in regard to the barn. Alison tries to talk, but Rafe smothers her attempts with kisses."

        "Jack: No, wait a minute, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Jack: This is not a good idea.",
        "Livvie: You didn't seem to mind.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that was --",
        "Livvie: Don't you want to --",
        "Jack: For old time's sake? No, no, not in this lifetime, no.",
        "Livvie: Jack, I hate you.",
        "Jack: You hate me? Why, because I'm not standing here looking like some sick, demented puppy dog? You want me to forget about all the past? You want us to be together? Is that --",
        "Livvie: No, jack, I just wanted a little comfort. You know, maybe a touch, something, a hug, anything.",
        "Jack: A touch, a touch, well, maybe that's what you wanted.",
        "Livvie: As if you don't. That's all I wanted to happen when I made that stupid wish, and it worked for a little while. I mean, you were kind of nice to me.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. A wish?",
        "Livvie: Just --",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Livvie: Relax, Jack. It doesn't make a difference.",
        "Jack: So -- so that's it!",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Jack: You told me that when you got Caleb's ring you didn't make a wish about me, and now you're telling me you did.",
        "Livvie: No, no. You asked if I wished --",
        "Jack: No, you told me you did.",
        "Livvie: For you to fall in love with me, and that's not what I wished for. That's not what I wanted. I just wished that you would stop hating me.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah? Well, I got news for you, Livvie. Your wish isn't working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Alison? You here? Alison? Are you back here? Alison? Man. This doesn't make sense. Where'd you go? You just take off from the barn like it's the last place on earth you want to be and you don't even tell me where you're going.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rafe: Alison?",
        "Elizabeth: What is wrong? Why are you so upset?",
        "Rafe: Sorry, Elizabeth. I just thought maybe you were --",
        "Elizabeth: That I was Alison. But -- where is she? Did you guys have a fight?",
        "Rafe: No. You know what? This isn't a good time. Will you leave, please?",
        "Elizabeth: No. I want to know what's wrong. What's wrong with Alison?",
        "Rafe: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You got to fix this.",
        "Caleb: Fix what?",
        "Alison: Don't give me that. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the night in the barn with us.",
        "Caleb: Yes, I remember the night in the barn.",
        "Alison: I can't get it out of my head, and it's driving me crazy. Look, you got to make it unhappen somehow, ok? I mean, I love Rafe with all of my heart and all of my soul, and I completely betrayed him with you.",
        "Caleb: You still haven't told him.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Caleb: This is another trick, is it, Alison? Be honest with me. I think we both know how important trust is at this point.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. I haven't told him. I can't. But you can help me, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: How?",
        "Alison: Just give me the ring. Please, you should -- just give me the ring and let me wish on it, or you can wish on it. We have to wish that this night never happened.",
        "Caleb: I can't do that.",
        "Alison: Why not? Why can't you?",
        "Caleb: The ring has many powers. But it can't change the past.",
        "Alison: You're lying.",
        "Caleb: I'm sorry, Alison. You're just going to have to live with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what, Elizabeth? I'm not in the mood for 20 questions right now, so if this has to do with your clothing line with Alison, I promise you, I'll give her a message, ok? She'll call you.",
        "Elizabeth: If she comes home.",
        "Rafe: What's that supposed to mean? Of course she's going to come home.",
        "Elizabeth: Rafe, look, ok, I know that you don't like me much.",
        "Rafe: No, I don't, but what does that have to do with anything right now?",
        "Elizabeth: And even though the feeling's mutual, it looks like we're stuck here. I mean, we both love Alison, and we both know that she's been acting very strange these last couple of days. So it's up to us to figure it out.",
        "Rafe: Ok, can you go?",
        "Elizabeth: So let me help you. No, I am not leaving here until you tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Rafe: Then you'll leave? Ok, fine. We were planning the wedding --",
        "Elizabeth: Without me?",
        "Rafe: Oh, come on! You know what? Not everything is about you, Elizabeth. We were just talking about it, ok? We just wanted it to happen -- finally, really happen. And we didn't want anything or anybody to get in the way -- not Caleb, not anyone, all right? And I just thought maybe it should be something different, you know, not a big church because obviously that didn't really work out. Just, you know, something a little simpler. So I took her to the barn.",
        "Elizabeth: You took her to a barn? You took her to a barn? To get married?",
        "Rafe: You know what? You don't understand. You don't understand this.",
        "Elizabeth: Why'd you take her to a barn? Rafe, what do you expect? Of course she ran off!",
        "Rafe: Elizabeth, it's where we fell in love. Ok? I mean, this barn -- that's where everything happened for us. It was great. It was amazing. That's where we could always connect, no matter what, ok? So that's why I took her there.",
        "Elizabeth: If this place is what you say it is, if it was so special to the both of you, why? Why would she run off? Why would she react like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Come on, there's got to be something you can do. That ring -- it grants wishes, and it's a very powerful ring.",
        "Caleb: I just told you, you can't change the past. Look, just calm down for a minute. Why don't you tell me what happened.",
        "Alison: We went to the barn this morning, Rafe and I. We went there.",
        "Caleb: Yes. Go ahead.",
        "Alison: We were there by ourselves. But all I kept seeing was you and me and what we were doing. I mean, come on, Caleb, don't you get it? Ok, that was our place! That was where we could connect with each other, and now it's completely ruined.",
        "Caleb: So get yourself a new place, all right? All this talk, all this is telling me is Rafe still doesn't know why.",
        "Alison: No, he doesn't, and I can't -- I can't tell him. But then again, I can't not tell him. I'm in a no-win situation here, and I don't think you understand that.",
        "Caleb: I do understand. You're the one being tormented by this and -- well, that doesn't seem fair, does it?",
        "Alison: Fair?",
        "Caleb: Fair. After all, you're not the one who's trying to take everything that's mine.",
        "Alison: No. That would be Livvie.",
        "Caleb: Nor are you the one that would do anything to destroy me.",
        "Alison: No. That would be Rafe.",
        "Caleb: But you are the one paying the price for their obsession. You're stuck in the middle. Collateral damage, so to speak. And that's kind of sad, really.",
        "Alison: Yeah. You don't really seem that upset.",
        "Caleb: Because I had to get over it. I understand who the guilty parties are, and it isn't you and it isn't me.",
        "Alison: Right, so then neither one of us should feel responsible for what happened?",
        "Caleb: Works for me.",
        "Alison: No guilt, no shame, no nothing?",
        "Caleb: I am who I am, Alison. Words like \"guilt\" and \"shame\" -- they don't even enter my vocabulary. Now, you, on the other hand, seem quite paralyzed by them.",
        "Alison: Because I'm human, Caleb. I am. And I'm not going to apologize for that. And I know in my head that you and I had no control over that night. I know that. But that was Livvie's wish, for her and for you, not for me. When she wished to have a night of passion, it should have been with you and her. But the ring -- it twisted it. Don't you get that? It was like dark magic that just twisted into something that was completely wrong.",
        "Caleb: There is, of course, one explanation that has nothing to do with the ring.",
        "Alison: What's that?",
        "Caleb: Maybe you're so upset because you didn't fight that magic a little harder.",
        "Alison: That was Livvie's wish.",
        "Caleb: Maybe all it did was fuel what was already there between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: You're going to wear a hole in the floor, Jack.",
        "Jack: Good. Maybe I can drop through it and disappear.",
        "Livvie: Oh, please, don't be mad at me.",
        "Jack: Oh, see, that's the joke, isn't it, Livvie? Because I can't! I can't be mad at you!",
        "Livvie: Well, go ahead! What's wrong with that? We've had some pretty good times.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we've had some great times.",
        "Livvie: Oh, just some great times?",
        "Jack: Yeah, until Caleb came back into town. Then the good times ended. At least, for me they did.",
        "Livvie: Well, you know what? Caleb isn't here. It's just the two of us.",
        "Jack: Don't -- don't touch me. Please don't touch me.",
        "Livvie: Jack, please --",
        "jack: Livvie, I mean it. No. No, no, no.",
        "Livvie: What, Jack? What is it?",
        "Jack: You don't know what you've done, do you? You, that wish -- you have made me completely defenseless.",
        "Livvie: Defenseless?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Livvie, I can't hate you anymore. News -- I can't hate you anymore!",
        "Livvie: Good!",
        "Jack: No matter how bad I want to, I can't hate you anymore.",
        "Livvie: Good, that's good, because we're friends.",
        "Jack: Oh. Maybe -- maybe not friends.",
        "Livvie: Come on, sure, you are, Jack. You know, friends -- good friends. Kiss, you know, touch. Just friends.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. You can do better than that.",
        "Livvie: What is going on? Why are looking at me like that?",
        "Jack: Oh, Livvie, you're the one who doesn't get it, do you?",
        "Livvie: Get what?",
        "Jack: All the hate. All the hate that I had built up inside for you. Mm-hmm. It was like my shield against you. When you made that wish, like I said, you made me completely defenseless.",
        "Livvie: What are you saying?",
        "Jack: It's the love. It's the love that I had for you when I saw you down at the river. Remember that? You looked so beautiful, Livvie. I love you so much. I'm so madly in love with you.",
        "Livvie: Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Jack, no, listen to me --",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, no. I feel so free that I can even say this!",
        "Livvie: No, it's not supposed to be like this!",
        "Jack: No, I love you!",
        "Livvie: You're confused.",
        "Jack: No, no --",
        "Livvie: You are confused right now.",
        "Jack: No, no, for the first time ever, I'm not confused. I'm not. You know what I want. I love you.",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, let me go, please.",
        "Jack: No, no. Marry me. Marry me.",
        "Livvie: What?",
        "Jack: Be my wife. Be my wife. It's what we've always dreamt about. You know, we've always wanted kids.",
        "Livvie: No, but Caleb --",
        "Jack: We're going to have to forget about Caleb. It's about us. I can board the windows. I'll board all the doors. Yes, and then I'll keep all the evil away. Oh, I love you. I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Why would she run away upset?",
        "Rafe: I don't know.",
        "Elizabeth: I actually think it's kind of cute -- in a hillbilly kind of way.",
        "Rafe: You know what? You just have to understand everything that happened there.",
        "Elizabeth: Well --",
        "Rafe's voice: What was I thinking? Not everything that went down in that place was good. I married Livvie there. I got shot there. No wonder Alison --",
        "Elizabeth: Rafe? Rafe, look, the bottom line is that I do know how much you love my daughter.",
        "Rafe: Do you? Well, it took you long enough to figure that out.",
        "Elizabeth: Admitting what we do know sometimes takes longer.",
        "Rafe: Hmm.",
        "Elizabeth: But I have watched the two of you overcome every single obstacle that you've ever been put up against.",
        "Rafe: Hmm, yeah, including her mother.",
        "Elizabeth: Well -- and I'd do it again if I didn't think that you had her best interests --",
        "Rafe: Yeah, ok. You know what --",
        "Elizabeth: No, let me finish!",
        "Rafe: I don't want to -- I don't want to do this.",
        "Elizabeth: Rafe, let me finish.",
        "Rafe: No, I don't want to do this.",
        "Elizabeth: Regardless of what I've said about you in the past and whatever it is that she's going through right now, I know that you can handle it.",
        "Rafe: That's it?",
        "Elizabeth: That is it.",
        "Rafe: Wow. Ok, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that maybe you just said something nice about me.",
        "Elizabeth: My daughter's happiness means more to me than anything in the entire world. And you make her happy. So I know you're going to be able to get this magic back.",
        "Rafe: I never thought I'd say this, but, Elizabeth, I think you're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Second time in a month. Not a bad right hand.",
        "Alison: I promise you, there is more where that came from if you think even for a second that I wanted to make love to you.",
        "Caleb: It was just a thought.",
        "Alison: No, no, it wasn't. It was you being cruel, as usual.",
        "[Caleb sighs]",
        "Alison: Look, we know what kind of power that ring holds and the power of the wish that Livvie made, and, yeah, maybe she did betray you, just like she betrays everyone else. And, no, it's not the first time that I've gotten caught in the middle. But I promise you, it was nothing more to it than that.",
        "Caleb: Hey, if you don't want to hear my theories, don't come to me for answers. You want to use this experience to torture yourself with, fine, go ahead. That's your choice. I'm using it to make some changes in my life.",
        "Alison: Oh, really? Like what?",
        "Caleb: I fired the band. And I ended things with Olivia. I'm moving on.",
        "Alison: Just like that?",
        "Caleb: Just like that. So instead of coming to me to try to get me to work my magic, why don't you just get over it and move on?",
        "Alison: Fine, I'll do that.",
        "Caleb: No, you won't. You'll try, but you won't be able to. Your little conscience inside won't allow you to.",
        "Alison: You know what? Rafe came back from heaven before, and he just got back from hell, all for me. So you know what? We will live our life together.",
        "Caleb: \"And there was much rejoicing.\"",
        "Alison: No, we will live together. We'll be very happy. We'll get married. And there's nothing that you or anyone else can do or say to change that.",
        "Caleb: Good. What are you still doing here, then, all right? You want to build a white picket fence? Go start building.",
        "Alison: Fine, I'm gone.",
        "Caleb: You have a good life, Alison.",
        "Alison: Thanks. I intend to.",
        "Caleb: You go ahead. You try to ignore that ache. Try to ignore that knot in your stomach. The longer the pain goes on, the sweeter it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, I can't! We can't! You shouldn't! I shouldn't.",
        "Jack: Come on, come on, this is what you wanted, right?",
        "Livvie: No, not permanently.",
        "Jack: Being together.",
        "Livvie: Ah!",
        "Jack: Oh, your leg -- let me fix it.",
        "Livvie: No, I'm fine. Don't touch my leg.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, let me fix it.",
        "Livvie: I am fine.",
        "Jack: What? This is what you wanted, Livvie.",
        "Livvie: No, not like this! I wanted us to be friends, Jack! Friends, that's it!",
        "Jack: You're my soul mate! I love you! I love you! You're my soul mate. You're my heart.",
        "Livvie: Don't get up. I can't do this, Jack! Not to you!",
        "[Jack snickers]",
        "Jack: Whoo! I gotcha. I gotcha. I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!",
        "Livvie: You are a bastard!",
        "Jack: Whoa, Livvie, come on, come on, at least I can't hate you, but I can do that. Oh, she's such a bad sport.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Well?",
        "Rafe: There's no answer, not anywhere.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, you know, we're just going to have to find her. Let's just get in the car and we'll decide where to -- where to go.",
        "Rafe: Hey, you know what, Elizabeth? It's just, you know, for what it's worth, you've been -- you've been great, so --",
        "Elizabeth: Well, just -- no, it's just --",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Rafe: Hey.",
        "Elizabeth: Sweetie?",
        "Alison: Mother. What are you doing here?",
        "Rafe: Hey.",
        "Elizabeth: Nothing -- nothing important at all. Just -- well, I guess that's my cue.",
        "Alison: No, wait. You don't have to leave.",
        "Elizabeth: You know, I'll just -- I know. I'll call you later. Just remember one thing, Alison. Just don't ever let anybody or anything stop you from being happy. Ok?",
        "Alison: Ok. I love you.",
        "Elizabeth: I love you, babe.",
        "Alison: Ok.",

        "Alison: Rafe, I'm --",
        "Rafe: No, I -- look, ok, I shouldn't have brought you there. All right? It's just when I think about that place, I just -- I remember all the good things.",
        "Alison: Rafe --",
        "Rafe: And I block out -- I just block out all the bad stuff. I know, that's what I did, and I -- the only thing that mattered, I -- I need you, you know? I want you.",
        "Alison: I need you. I need you, too, so much.",
        "Alison: No, no, I --",
