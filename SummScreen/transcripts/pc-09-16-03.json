        "After Jamal tracks down Imani's grandmother's restaurant in Silverhill, Alabama, he leaves a partial message for Jack before losing the signal on his cell phone. Recognizing the woman from the photo Imani showed him, he places an order and tries to establish a rapport so that he can get some information. After all his questions about family arouse her suspicions, she drugs his food. When he passes out, she confiscates his phone, draws the shade, and calls someone to take out the \"trash.\" Elizabeth tracks down Chris at the hospital for a nice surprise, but he is tired of her bothering him at work all the time. He goes to Ian's room, where Lucy again states that this is all his fault. Chris refuses to take the blame for any of this, because he shouldn't have had to play babysitter while Ian stole the serum and then went after Kevin. He blames Lucy, since Ian did this to try to live a normal life for her. After waking up in restraints, Ian is relieved to hear that Kevin is all right. Although Lucy accuses him of having gone too far this time, Ian intends to keep doing it until they find a cure. Chris informs him that it's over; he destroyed the rest of the formula and all the research. Furious, Ian says that he had no right, but Lucy tells her lover that he had no right to put everyone through hell. Ian still intends to continue, at least to find a way to control his dark side. He asks her not to stop him from leaving. After Chris was so mean to her, Elizabeth cancels the dinner reservations she had made as a surprise. Chris overhears and tries to apologize. Elizabeth informs him that she had noticed his anxiety about Ian and thought a nice dinner would cheer him up. His attempts to apologize don't quite placate her, but she agrees to go to dinner anyway--as long as he pays. Meanwhile, Caleb isn't pleased to see Olivia. Telling him that she came by to pick up a few of her things, she removes her coat and states that she has nothing to wear. Caleb appreciates her beauty but orders her to get out. Olivia responds by trying to seduce him. As they kiss, Caleb makes it a point to note that she hasn't stolen his ring again. Accusing him of being unable to forgive one mistake, she tells him to use the ring to wish that she had never stolen it from him. Caleb laughs, amused by the similarity to Alison's request. Olivia still wants to get him into bed, but Caleb points out that it wouldn't make a difference, because he still wouldn't be able to believe a word she says. Olivia refuses to ever let him go. She leaves, confident that he will never be free of her. Caleb is equally confident that she's fooling herself."

        "Jamal: Hey, Jack, what's up, baby boy? I just wanted to leave you a message to let you know that I'm cool and everything and where I'm at and whatnot and everything. So, I know you got to deal with that latest Livvie chapter you got going on. Man, it is always something with her. Dude, I'm telling you, she's crazy. Anyways, it's ok that you didn't come. I actually think I got a pretty good lead on Imani. I'm actually sitting in this nice little funky restaurant in the middle of Silverhill, Alabama, at the Silverhill Cafe, the south's finest cooking. Anyways, this is a cool little joint, you know. It's got some down-home cooking and stuff. I'm pretty sure it's her grandma's spot, but no one seems to be around, but you never know. I don't --",

        "Jamal: No service. Great. Whatever.",
        "Woman: There you are. And here you are, sir.",
        "Jamal: Hi.",
        "Woman: Good evening.",
        "Jamal: Good evening. Ma'am, is that apple pie?",
        "Woman: Fresh from the oven. Can I serve you up some?",
        "Jamal: You know what? I think I'll save that for dessert. I just got off a long road trip, and I'm very tired. My butt hurts, and I'm real, real hungry.",
        "Woman: Well, you've come to the right place.",
        "Jamal: Good, good.",
        "Woman: You know what you want?",
        "Jamal: I was looking at the catfish. How is it?",
        "Woman: The best you'll ever have.",
        "Jamal: Then it is the catfish I will have.",
        "Woman: All right. And apple pie for dessert.",
        "Jamal: Yes, that's right.",
        "Woman: Good.",
        "Jamal: I'll let you take care of it. I think you know what you're doing.",
        "Woman: I sure will.",
        "Woman: You traveling alone, son?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, I actually decided to start climbing my family tree, and the road led here, but I hit a dead end so far.",
        "Woman: Well, you got a name? Maybe I know them.",
        "Jamal: Ramsey. Jack Ramsey.",
        "Woman: Ramsey?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Woman: No, I can't say I ever heard of them.",
        "Jamal: Well, you got family around here?",
        "Woman: No. No, just me. But you just relax. I'm going to take good care of you, all right?",
        "Jamal: Ok, thank you.",
        "Woman: Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Guess what -- I have a lovely surprise for you.",
        "Chris: Elizabeth, I am not in the mood.",
        "Elizabeth: What?",
        "Chris: How many times do I have to tell you that I am a doctor in a hospital? It's a real job, ok? I don't have time to play games with you or Marty or Iris, who, by the way, is getting on my last nerve.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, come on, she's so sweet.",
        "Chris: You know something? I really don't care. This is my job. I have patients -- people with real problems. Let's not try and pretend that anything you have to say matters at all.",
        "Lucy: I don't quite understand. I thought you said that the sedative should have worn off by now. Why hasn't it?",
        "Chris: His physiological makeup is chaotic right now. How and when he responds to the antidepressant is anybody's guess.",
        "Lucy: That's not good enough. You are the doctor who concocted this whole ridiculous serum that made him go off the deep end like that, so you are responsible for fixing him. I want you to fix this.",
        "Chris: But I was not responsible for playing babysitter while he stole the serum, injected enough of it in him to make King Kong go crazy and then go after your ex. Besides, he was doing it to live a normal life with you, so don't go laying all the blame on my doorstep.",
        "Lucy: Ian? Hey. It's ok. It's ok.",
        "Ian: What truck hit me?",
        "Chris: Sorry about the restraints. I had to do it.",
        "Ian: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: I know you think that you did this for me, but you just went too far this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Well, I wasn't expecting you.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, obviously not. So, Alison was here?",
        "Caleb: I see nothing's changed. Still obsessed as ever.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, at least I'm consistent.",
        "Caleb: Hmm. She came by to offer condolences on our breakup. Now that that's out of the way, what are you doing here?",
        "Livvie: I came by to get a few of my things.",
        "Caleb: I'll have them sent to you, save you the trouble.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's a good idea, but, see, there's a problem, Caleb. I don't have anything to wear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: How is Kevin?",
        "Lucy: He's fine.",
        "Ian: Good.",
        "Lucy: Why did you do this? Why couldn't you wait?",
        "Ian: I had to try, for you.",
        "Lucy: So you did all of this for me?",
        "Ian: And Danny and Christina. And I would do it again. I will keep doing it until we find a cure. Chris.",
        "Lucy: God, you're impossible.",
        "Chris: I'm sorry, Ian, it's over. Forget it.",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? Nothing's over.",
        "Chris: Ian, you wanted a vaccine that would take away the vampire symptoms, let you age normally. Instead, you got an vamped-up metabolic rate and a psychotic breakdown.",
        "Ian: We just need a little more time, that's all. A little more time. That's all we need.",
        "Chris: I've destroyed the rest of the formula and all the research. It's over.",
        "Ian: You had no right. You had no right, Ramsey.",
        "Lucy: And you have no right to do what you're doing. You have no right to put the people who love you through hell like this. You've got to stop. You have got to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caleb: Maybe I wasn't clear. Or maybe you just didn't hear me. It's over.",
        "Livvie: Caleb, you were very angry with me when you made that decision.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. And it's the kind of anger that sticks with you for a long time.",
        "Livvie: But you can get over it.",
        "Caleb: You are beautiful, and any man would want you.",
        "Livvie: Maybe you should just stop talking because I think that we communicate best in between the spaces of the words. Like right here. And right here. And right here.",
        "Caleb: You have to go.",
        "Livvie: If I thought for one moment that that's what you wanted, I would. I can see it in your eyes. You want to feel my skin on your hands, and you want to taste my lips. You want to feel what it's like to make love to me again. Everything you need is right here. Hiding from blemishes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: There you go.",
        "Jamal: Wow. Wow. You got enough here to feed a small army. What are you doing to me?",
        "Woman: Making you big and strong.",
        "Jamal: All right. I got to say, these collard greens are great, and the catfish -- I have never tasted anything like this in my life.",
        "Woman: Well, your waffles are on the way. And you like grits?",
        "Jamal: I love grits. But I don't have them anymore because nobody up north knows how to fix them.",
        "Woman: Oh, please come again. Thank you very much. Good night.",
        "Jamal: Are you closing up? You want me to pay my bill or --",
        "Woman: Oh, honey, don't worry about it. I don't leave until the last customer has cleaned his plate.",
        "Jamal: Well, that could take a few hours. Wow. I remember my mom and my grandma used to set up meals like this, and each of us -- we would all have our own individualized jobs. I don't see how you do this without any help. I mean, you could use a couple of grandkids of your own.",
        "Woman: Yeah, well you learn to get along without the help.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Is this your family here?",
        "Woman: Maybe just somebody's family. Why you so interested?",
        "Jamal: Well, you know, like I said, that's what this trip is all about for me -- family trees, seeing what that connection means, and, you know, just stuff like that.",
        "Woman: Well, that's how it works, son. You got to protect your own.",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, you got to --",
        "[Jamal yawns]",
        "Jamal: Oh, excuse me.",
        "Woman: A little worn out from your trip, huh?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Woman: And these questions.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Woman: What were you saying, again?",
        "Jamal: I was saying collard greens are --",
        "Woman: Uh-huh. Good?",
        "Jamal: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: B-a-r-r-I-n-g-t-o-n -- Barrington? Yes. No, no, I don't need the champagne or the candles. I just need to cancel the entire dinner reservation, please. Dr. Ramsey will be eating crow for quite some time. Right, thank you. Have a lovely evening.",
        "Chris: You made dinner reservations for us?",
        "Elizabeth: At the grill.",
        "Chris: I thought you had George business to discuss.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, I did. But I noticed that you'd been having a lot of anxiety with what you're doing with Ian, and I just thought it would be really nice to have a fabulous dinner and cheer you up. But you know what? You don't deserve me even being nice to you.",
        "Chris: I was kind of rough on you, I guess.",
        "Elizabeth: Rough on me? You are a jerk. I don't even know what I was thinking by trying to be nice. But you know what? Lesson learned. Ciao.",
        "Chris: Elizabeth, hold on, hold on. Don't go. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: Look at me. I love you. But I don't think you understand.",
        "Lucy: But that's just it. I do understand. I think I -- I really think I understand better than you do. And what you're doing is making everything worse.",
        "Ian: I can't live my life like this.",
        "Lucy: You have no choice right now. This is us. This is what we have together. This is our time together. And every single minute you keep trying to change this part of you that you hate so much is every single minute we can't be together. And I want to spend every single precious moment with you that I can.",
        "Ian: I don't even know who I am anymore. I would have killed Kevin if you wouldn't have stopped me.",
        "Lucy: That was the drug. You wouldn't have done it. That was the --",
        "Ian: No. What if this drug brought out who I really am?",
        "Lucy: I don't believe that.",
        "Ian: I liked it. I liked the way it made me feel -- like an animal in the jungle, strong, no rules. Just freedom. Sharing blood was just another part of the day.",
        "Lucy: I know that.",
        "Ian: And that's what you want? That's the man you want to spend the rest of your life with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Please don't stop.",
        "Caleb: I just had to make sure.",
        "Livvie: Honey, don't think, just feel, ok?",
        "Caleb: I had to make sure that I still had it.",
        "Livvie: You are evil.",
        "Caleb: Can you blame me?",
        "Livvie: One mistake? Caleb, you can't forgive me for one mistake?",
        "Caleb: That's exactly what I'm saying.",
        "Livvie: Then fix it. Fix it. Make a wish on this ring that I'd never stolen your ring and done anything with it. Please. Can you make this -- why are you laughing at me?",
        "Caleb: Oh, it's funny because you and Alison have a lot more in common than you would think. None of you realize the power of things, and you never understand the consequences for your actions.",
        "Livvie: Ok, then teach me. I'll learn.",
        "Caleb: Hopping into bed doesn't fix it.",
        "Livvie: This isn't only about sex, Caleb. I love you. I cannot imagine a life without you. I don't want us to be apart. If you ever loved me, will you show me? Please. We can figure out the rest later.",
        "Caleb: I don't know how many different ways to say this to you. We could make love till morning, it wouldn't change anything. When we wake up, I still couldn't believe a word coming out of that beautiful, lying mouth of yours.",
        "Livvie: Fine. Fine. But if you think it's going to be that easy to get rid of me, then think again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Some people just don't know when to leave well enough alone. So you're searching for your family tree, huh? Is that it? Well, you won't be needing this.",
        "Woman: Yeah, it's me. I've got some trash here that needs hauling out. Come on over. Yeah, I'll save you some apple pie. Don't mess with my baby and think that you can get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elizabeth: Don't. Don't even start with me.",
        "Chris: I just want a chance to show you that I'm not the horse's ass that you think I am. I mean, at least not completely.",
        "Elizabeth: Is that your version of an apology?",
        "Chris: You can spank me if it would make you feel better.",
        "Elizabeth: Don't make me laugh. Plus, you'd probably like that. Go on. Keep groveling. See where it gets you.",
        "Chris: Well, it's not like I haven't done it before.",
        "Elizabeth: Doesn't matter. I've already canceled the dinner reservation.",
        "Chris: Doesn't matter. I have pull in this town. I can call in a favor. Is that a yes?",
        "Elizabeth: I don't know. I'm not sure I want to sit there and listen to the rude way that you've become accustomed to speaking to me.",
        "Chris: I really don't deserve to eat with you or possibly ever eat again, but if you'll reconsider, I would like to take you up on that offer for dinner. How's that?",
        "Elizabeth: Needs work -- over dinner. You're buying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I bet this is the part where you expect me to run screaming from the room, right? Get the hell out of here? It's not going to happen. I think that right now I know you better than you know yourself.",
        "Ian: You're not listening to me.",
        "Lucy: Oh, I'm listening. I heard everything you said, and I saw everything you did. And what you did to Kevin was ugly and it was violent --",
        "Ian: And that's who I am.",
        "Lucy: Part of you. But then there's the doctor, the healer. And the man who sings off-key his little boy to sleep every single night. And the man that reads me poetry and who makes me laugh all the time for no reason and cry just from the joy of being able to be around you. The man who is so compassionate and so brilliant. And the man with such light coming out of his eyes that I know every minute he loves me.",
        "Ian: And that's what I want. That's who I want to be for you.",
        "Lucy: Please. What could I do?",
        "Ian: There is something.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Anything. Tell me.",
        "Ian: Don't stop me.",
        "Lucy: Don't stop you from what?",
        "Ian: Don't stop me from leaving. You know it's right. It has to be that for you, for Danny, for Christina, for me. If I can't cure what's inside me, I have to learn how to control it.",
        "Lucy: No, there has to be a better way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I will never let you go. Ever.",
        "Caleb: It's not up to you.",
        "Livvie: You're wrong. You think you can tell me what to think, who to love, and how to feel? But in the end, the truth is right here, Caleb, and in here. You have been angry with me before.",
        "Caleb: This is different.",
        "Livvie: Maybe. But you've never been able to turn your back on me.",
        "Caleb: I don't want you in my life.",
        "Livvie: I'm what you need, Caleb. Like the air that you breathe, like the blood that makes you awake in the morning. We're only half alive when we're apart.",
        "Caleb: Then that would be a relief.",
        "Livvie: You will never be free of me, Caleb. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I'm going to be right there in your head, haunting you, and you'll realize that every word I've said is true. So till then, you sleep tight, my love.",
        "Caleb: You're deceiving yourself, Olivia. We'll see who haunts who in this world."
