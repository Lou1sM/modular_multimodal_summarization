        "Lucy: I don't want to jinx this. I don't, I don't, I don't. ",
        "Kevin: Jinx what? ",
        "Lucy: All of this. All of this incredible, heart-stopping, toe-curling, \r\nwonderful happiness. Oh, Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: Hmm. ",
        "Lucy: I'm so glad we're keeping our engagement a secret just between us for a \r\nwhile. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, me, too. I mean, after all, our last few engagements have been \r\npretty much disasters. Which kind of begs the question, just how are we going to \r\nbreak the news? ",
        "Lucy: We do stink at engagements, don't we? ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: What are we good at? Well, besides that, parties. We're really good at \r\nparties. What about giving a party? ",
        "Kevin: I like going to parties. ",
        "Lucy: We love parties. ",
        "Kevin: We love parties. ",
        "Lucy: What about a Christmas party? A Christmas party and we invite all our \r\nguests, and when they arrive, we announce they are at -- ooh, our wedding. ",
        "Kevin: That's a great idea. That's a perfect idea. I'm so glad I thought of \r\nit. ",
        "Lucy: You did not. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know. I'm marrying you. I mean, you know, besides the fact \r\nthat you're beautiful and sexy. Oh, exciting. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Lucy: Uh-uh, uh-uh. I'm going to hammer that phone. Give me a hammer. ",
        "Kevin: I'm a doctor. I have to -- ",
        "Lucy: You don't have to get it. ",
        "Kevin: I have to get it. I have to get it. I'll be right back. I'm going to \r\nkill whoever's on the other -- hello? ",
        "Ian: Sorry for calling so late. It's Eve. I need your help. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Livvie? Livvie? ",
        "Alison: Jack, Jack, she doesn't seem to be anywhere, ok? Maybe there's \r\nnothing to worry about. ",
        "Jack: If something happens to her -- Livvie? ",
        "Alison: Jack, do you really think that she would come to such a scary place?\r\n",
        "Jack: Yes, yes. It's Caleb's sanctuary. He would bring her here. ",
        "Alison: Yes, but Caleb is dead, ok? We saw him disintegrate. ",
        "Jack: He took her for his bride, and he's not letting go without a fight. ",
        "Alison: Yes, but do you really think some dead guy still has some sort of \r\npull over Livvie? ",
        "Jack: Alison, it's her bracelet. She's here. ",
        "Alison: Well, how come we can't find her, unless she was -- ",
        "Jack: Unless Caleb did something to her. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Oh! ",
        "Livvie: Help me. Somebody, please -- ",
        "",
        "Livvie's Voice: Goodbye, Caleb. You have no control over me. Not anymore. No, it \r\ncan't be. And I threw it off the roof. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: Olivia, my sweet. You came back for me. As if you could ever \r\nstay away. Olivia. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Ah, you look so peaceful. ",
        "Gabriela: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. What's up? Here's the book you wanted. ",
        "Gabriela: Thanks. ",
        "Jamal: And while I was at your house, I grabbed these pictures. I figured you \r\nmight want to check them out. ",
        "Gabriela: Emilio and Joe. Who's this little devil? ",
        "Jamal: Oh, you know that was me when I was a kid. I'm glad you didn't throw \r\nthose out. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. I wanted to when I was so deep under Caleb's spell. Something \r\nstopped me. I don't know. Maybe it was this look on your face, like you were so \r\nbad but also kind of sweet. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, now. Now you're tripping. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm glad you brought these. Maybe they'll help me get back to \r\nnormal. ",
        "Jamal: I thought after Caleb died, everything's supposed to go back to \r\nnormal. ",
        "Gabriela: I know, I know. Everything's supposed to go back to the way it was, \r\nand sometimes I really believe that it will. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Gabriela: I still have these confusing feelings, like Caleb is still here, \r\nlike he never really left. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, he was a pretty scary dude. ",
        "Gabriela: I know he's gone. We all saw him die. But he's still with me in a \r\nlot of ways. ",
        "",
        "Alison: Jack, I don't see Livvie anywhere, ok? Maybe we should, like, split \r\nup. ",
        "Jack: No. No, Jamal would kill me if I let you out of my sight. ",
        "Alison: Jamal is with Gabby, ok, and he knows how important it is to help \r\npeople that really need it, and that is why I'm helping you. ",
        "Jack: Look, Alison, maybe you should wait outside. ",
        "Alison: What? No. Hey. Two pair of eyes are better than one, ok? So this \r\nplace is really huge. Maybe we should, like, split up. ",
        "Jack: I see why Jamal calls you Spunky. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: Look, I'm going to go further inside and look for Livvie, but you wait \r\nright here, all right? ",
        "Alison: All right. Ok. Yeah. Ok. I'll be fine. ",
        "Alison: Ok, just a little announcement through these caves -- if there's any \r\nsort of psycho waiting to jump out at me or hurt me in any way, I may be very \r\nsmall, but I pack a very hefty punch. And I can scream like no one else. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Oh -- I guess you probably should go talk to Ian by yourself. He \r\ndoesn't want me around while he's discussing Eve, I'm sure. So I'll catch up to \r\nyou later. ",
        "Kevin: Ok, well, why don't you just wait for me, and then we'll go home \r\ntogether and we'll pick up where we left off? ",
        "Lucy: Hmm. You know, this secret engagement is so not a disaster. See you.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I just want to watch you walk away. ",
        "Lucy: You better. ",
        "Chris: Well. If it isn't my favorite little vampire slayer. ",
        "Lucy: Chris, why don't you go back to searching for that cyber date on that \r\ncomputer of yours, huh? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. Hey, tell me, since there are vampire slayers, I mean, that \r\nmeans there's still more vampires, right? Otherwise you'd be out of a job. ",
        "Lucy: Does this shoulder look even remotely interested? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but I'm just saying that everybody who was bitten may have \r\nturned back to normal, but there's still a possibility that the vampire urges \r\ncould, you know, resurface, right? ",
        "Lucy: What -- what is with you? Everyone around you is not using the \"V\" word. \r\nWe're doing our damnedest to put the whole thing behind us. Leave it alone. ",
        "Chris: No, I'll never leave it alone. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Thanks for coming. ",
        "Kevin: No problem. So what happened? The last time I saw Eve, she was happier \r\nthan she'd ever been. ",
        "Ian: Nightmares, bad ones. ",
        "Kevin: About Caleb? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. About Caleb taking the baby and about vampires. ",
        "Kevin: Well, just so you know, Livvie's been having some problems, too, but \r\n-- how's Eve now? ",
        "Ian: Sleeping, thank God. But before that, she wouldn't let go of the baby. I \r\nhate seeing her like this. ",
        "Kevin: I understand, but given everything she's been through and add to that \r\nsome postpartum depression, I'm not surprised. We'll talk her down. We'll -- \r\nwe'll calm her out. ",
        "Ian: Ok. Thanks. You don't think -- ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Ian: You don't think there's a chance that Caleb's still around, do you? ",
        "Livvie: Help me. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie? Oh, my God. Doc! Ian! Livvie -- ",
        "Kevin: God, Livvie, what happened? ",
        "Livvie: I've been bit -- ",
        "Kevin: You've been bit? ",
        "Ian: In the leg? ",
        "Lucy: Bitten? But Caleb's gone, Doc. How could she have been bitten? ",
        "Ian: Hey, look at this. ",
        "Livvie: I can't swallow. ",
        "Lucy: My gosh. ",
        "Chris: Her tongue's swelling. There's a rash on her arms. ",
        "Ian: She's reacting to an animal bite. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, can you hear me? Can you talk? ",
        "Chris: All right, let's go. Let's get her into a room. Colleen, start a line, \r\ndraw bloods, get her on O-2, and have epi standing by. ",
        "Ian: We're almost there. ",
        "Chris: Just hang on, ok? Let's get her BP. ",
        "Ian: Call respiratory. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, just hold on, all right? Hold on. ",
        "Chris: We have to identify what bit her. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, can you tell us what it was that attacked you? ",
        "Livvie: It was -- it was a snake. And Caleb, he was chasing me. ",
        "Kevin: Honey, Caleb's dead. You know that. ",
        "Livvie: No -- I couldn't -- I couldn't get rid of the -- the ring and -- and \r\nwhen I opened the music box, there was wind around me. ",
        "Kevin: Honey, I want you to settle down now and try to save your strength, \r\nok? ",
        "Livvie: Evil. There's evil's all around me. ",
        "Chris: She's hallucinating. Must be the poison. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, try and listen to me, all right? There's no evil wind, there's \r\nno music box, and there's no Caleb. ",
        "",
        "Alison: What is that? I think I see something, but if I can just get to it.\r\n",
        "Jack: Alison, don't move. ",
        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Jack: Don't move. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. It's a snake. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God, Jack. Oh, my God. That thing would've bit me if you \r\ndidn't kill it. Ew, my God. I've never seen anything like that. ",

        "Lucy: Jack, it's Lucy. Listen, I'm here at the hospital and Livvie is here.\r\n",
        "Jack: Lucy, I can't hear. There's static on the phone. What happened to \r\nLivvie? ",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. She was bitten by a snake. Do you know anything about \r\nthat? Could you tell me -- Jack, can you hear me? Can you -- ",
        "Alison: What? What is it? What's wrong? ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. I think Livvie got bit by the snake. We need to get out of \r\nhere. ",
        "Alison: What? Are you -- ",
        "Jack: Maybe they'll need this. ",
        "Alison: No, not my purse. Ok, that's fine. ",
        "Jack: All right, let's get out of here. ",
        "Alison: But wait, Jack. I saw something in there and -- ",
        "Jack: Who cares? Let's go. We got to -- ",
        "Alison: It was giving me a little, you know, weird vibe -- ",
        "Jack: Ok, who wouldn't get a weird feeling, Alison? Come on. Let's go. We got \r\nto get to the hospital. ",

        "Gabriela: The truth is I hurt a lot of people, Jamal. I just wish I could \r\nmake it up to them. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, you were under some powerful spell. Ok, you didn't know exactly \r\nwhat you were doing. ",
        "Gabriela: The worst part is that no matter how ashamed I am of the way that I \r\nbehaved, if Caleb were to come back to me -- ",
        "Jamal: Now look, you know exactly what you would do. You would kick his \r\nvampire butt straight to the curb. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm not so sure. That's why I keep praying. I mean, don't you get \r\nit? I was the one protecting Caleb until the bitter end. When I think about all \r\nthose lives I almost cost -- including yours, my own brother -- because of my \r\nstupid, blind loyalty to Caleb. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby, come on, you weren't yourself. Everybody already knows that.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: When I think about how I hurt Joe. I lost the best thing that ever \r\nhappened to me. ",
        "Jamal: Gabby, you can get your life back. Ok, look. Caleb only has power over \r\nyou if you let him, so don't. ",
        "Gabriela: I just want to make things better -- not just for me, but for the \r\npeople that I hurt. And I'm not going to let Caleb get to me anymore. ",
        "",
        "Chris: It's positive. Neurotoxic venom. Livvie's reaction's more severe \r\nbecause she moved after she was bitten. ",
        "Kevin: Look, she's having trouble breathing. Isn't there anything we can give \r\nher? ",
        "Chris: Without knowing exactly what kind of snake bit her, we -- we can only \r\ntreat the symptoms. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Jack and Alison found the snake that bit Livvie, I think. ",
        "Jack: Livvie. Livvie, it's me. It's me. And it's going to be all right. Oh, \r\nit's going to be all right. ",
        "Alison: This spooky snake almost bit me, but Jack -- he killed it. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'm glad you brought it. See if we can track it down. Can I take \r\nthis? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go, go, go. ",
        "Kevin: I'll be right behind you. ",

        "Jack: Shh. Shh. Here. Caleb is not going to come between us. What we have is \r\ntoo strong. Shh. You keep telling yourself that, all right? I would trade places \r\nwith you in a heartbeat. You stay with me. You don't go. You stay right with me. \r\nOk? I'm right here. I'm right here. ",
        "Alison: Chris, you're going to be able to find an antidote, right, from that \r\nsnake's venom? Livvie's going to be ok, right? She's going to be ok? ",
