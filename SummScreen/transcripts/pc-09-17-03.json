        "Jamal wakes up to find himself tied to a chair at the Silverhill Cafe, while Imani's grandmother goes through his wallet for information. Although he tries to explain why he lied to her, Madea doesn't trust him at all. Imani walks in the door just as a man known as Junior grabs Jamal's neck. Imani unties Jamal and explains that he's a friend, but Madea doesn't like it. Imani is alarmed to hear that he tracked her down from the photo she showed him. Madea warns Imani that Jamal will learn too much if he stays, but Imani is confident that it will be all right. Back in Port Charles, Reese cheerily invites Ricky to accompany her to London, where she intends to start looking for her mother. Unlike Ricky, she isn't depressed about being fired from the band. She likes being a free agent, and now she thinks that she and the drummer can make a go of it as a duo. Casey urges Ricky to choose her over a woman he merely likes. Finding Ricky talking to an invisible person again, Reese sadly asks him to choose between reality and fantasy. Insulted by his hesitation, Reese storms off. Casey appears to Ricky again, and when a passerby acknowledges her presence, Ricky wonders what's going on. Casey explains that she is real, whereas he's been conjuring up a nasty version of her in his mind, and she doesn't appreciate it one bit. After Alison confesses to having sex with Caleb, Rafe tears out of the apartment with murder on his mind. The image fades as Alison begins to wake up, and she talks in her sleep about how she shouldn't have told Rafe about Caleb. When Rafe asks her about it, Alison says that it was an upsetting dream that she would rather forget. Rafe assures her that he doesn't want to continue the war with Caleb. For the first time in his life, he is choosing his own destiny, and he chooses Alison. Unfortunately, Alison is unable to get the memory of what she did with Caleb out of her mind."

        "Jamal: What did you do? Did you drug me or something?",
        "Madea: Because you were sticking your nose where it didn't belong, Mr. Jamal Woods.",
        "Jamal: Oh. I guess I wasn't exactly honest about that.",
        "Madea: You think I was born yesterday?",
        "Jamal: No, no, ma'am, I don't, ok? I was -- I'm not here for any trouble.",
        "Madea: Oh, don't \"ma'am\" me. And you ain't nothing but trouble. They sent you, didn't they?",
        "Jamal: No, nobody sent me. Nobody sent me. I'm just looking for Imani.",
        "Madea: Well, you just gave me the wrong answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: Cheers.",
        "Ricky: Huh. All right. Was it all a nightmare, or did we really get fired from the band?",
        "Reese: Reality check, Ricky -- The Stephen Clay Experience as we once knew it is now history. Look on the bright side -- at least Caleb let us leave with our lives.",
        "Ricky: Ah. So now it's just back to life in the slow lane, right?",
        "Reese: I don't know. It feels pretty good being a free agent. Sky's the limit, drummer boy.",
        "Ricky: All right, what's that?",
        "Reese: Airplane tickets, two of them.",
        "Ricky: To London?",
        "Reese: For starters. I have a lead to where my mum might be. I want to find her.",
        "Ricky: Wait a minute.",
        "Reese: Thought you might like a change of scenery.",
        "Ricky: You're asking me to help you find your mom?",
        "Reese: Why not? We'll check out the action. I'll talk to some people, get some work lined up.",
        "Ricky: All right. How long?",
        "Reese: As long as we want. Tickets are open-ended. Listen, if we get our act together, this could be a whole new game for us.",
        "Ricky: So now I'm dreaming, right?",
        "Reese: This is no dream, baby. I always thought we'd make a great duo. You know it's true.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Reese: I'll be right back.",
        "Casey: Miss me?",
        "Ricky: Did you hear that?",
        "Casey: You can go with her if it means so much to you, Ricky, but don't count on me making that trip.",

        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Rafe: Hi. Good morning. You look beautiful.",
        "Alison: Morning.",
        "Rafe: Last night was amazing. Well, how do you say, perfecto?",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Rafe: Hey --",
        "Alison: I can't.",
        "Rafe: Can't what?",
        "Alison: Rafe, the thing -- the thing with us -- I mean, we work so well together because we never hold any secrets from each other, right? Because if we did, we would be really lost.",
        "Rafe: Hey --",
        "Alison: And --",
        "Rafe: What's going on?",
        "Alison: You know how much I love you.",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Something happened when you were gone, something really terrible.",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Alison: I -- I had sex with Caleb.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamal: Look, I am a friend of your granddaughter's. You have -- you have to believe me.",
        "Madea: Tell me who just fell off a turnip truck. Oh, so all this talk about trying to learn about your family tree is a crock, right? Why you have to lie?",
        "Jamal: Well, if I'd have come in here talking about \"where's Imani?\" You'd probably -- or he probably would've put a shotgun to my head. Imani and I have become good friends. I'm -- I'm part of the reason why she left.",
        "Madea: Is that so?",
        "Jamal: No. No, no, no, no -- I didn't -- no, no, it's not -- I didn't mean it like that. Look, I know about the dirty cop that's after her. I know about the murder. And I also know that she didn't do it.",
        "Madea: You sure think you know an awful lot, don't you? Enough to be talking out of both sides of your mouth. But you still haven't given me a reason to believe you.",
        "Jamal: I'm -- I'm telling you the truth.",
        "Madea: So all this about your grandmother cooking for you --",
        "Jamal: Oh, that's true.",
        "Madea: Learning how to bake pies?",
        "Jamal: That's true, every word.",
        "Madea: Oh, yeah? You a country boy?",
        "Jamal: Well, not exactly, no. I'm --",
        "Madea: You at least from the south?",
        "Jamal: Does South Philly count?",
        "Madea: I heard enough.",
        "Jamal: Well, just ask her.",
        "Madea: What?",
        "Jamal: Just ask Imani about me. She'd tell you I would never hurt her, ever. That is if she's here.",
        "Madea: I'm not saying she's here, and I'm not saying she isn't. And if I'm not, I wouldn't ask her if she was.",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm just worried about Imani, that's it. I just want to find her.",
        "Madea: So you say. The trouble is, if you found me, it's only a matter of time before you find her. And I am not going to let that happen. Junior --",
        "Jamal: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait --",
        "Imani: Jamal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You had sex with Caleb? Is this some kind of joke?",
        "Alison: No. Nothing about this is funny at all. You were gone, and something happened.",
        "Rafe: Stop. I mean, you had -- you let him --",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: I don't understand.",
        "Alison: Listen to me, ok? It's not like it sounds. I mean, I didn't -- the ring was involved. And Livvie was trying to make a wish. She made a wish for her and for Caleb, and I was there at the time. I was with him.",
        "Rafe: You were -- you were with him.",
        "Alison: I was just trying -- I was trying to beg him to bring you back to me, you know, back from where you were --",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, wait a minute. Wait -- you -- you had sex with Caleb because you were trying to get him to release me?",
        "Alison: It was Livvie's wish, and it went terribly wrong. I didn't know what I was doing, and Caleb didn't know what he was doing. I didn't know how to find the words to tell you what I had done. I didn't know how to say to the man I love that I slept -- that I slept with someone else. This is -- this is killing me. Rafe, can you ever forgive me? Can you?",
        "Rafe: I'm going to kill him.",
        "Alison: Rafe -- please, wait.",
        "Rafe: I'm going to kill him for what he did to you.",
        "Alison: No, no -- no, no, no, no, no! Look, you promised me --",
        "Rafe: He's not going to touch you or anyone else again.",
        "Alison: Look, you promised me that this war was over between --",
        "Rafe: That's right, because you can't have a war with a dead vampire! This time, I'm not going to stop until he takes his last poisoned breath!",
        "Alison: Rafe, I'm sorry! Don't do this! He's going to kill you! Please! Rafe, come back to me. Please don't go.",
        "Rafe: Hey --",
        "Alison: I shouldn't have told you. I shouldn't have told you about Caleb. I shouldn't have told you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: If you go off flying to Europe with that little musical cupcake of yours, you can kiss me goodbye.",
        "Ricky: Yeah?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Ricky: As opposed to kissing a real girl?",
        "Casey: Oh, you call that real? Please, Ricky, I'm real. Ricky, Ricky, it's you and me, just like always, baby.",
        "Ricky: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Ricky: Look -- before, it was hard enough being in love with an angel, but at least you were flesh and blood, all right? At least for a little bit. But now -- this isn't good for me.",
        "Casey: Do you love Reese?",
        "Ricky: No, all right, but I like her a lot, ok?",
        "Casey: Oh, ok --",
        "Ricky: And maybe that's good enough for now.",
        "Casey: So you are saying that you would rather be with someone who you like than with the woman who loves you, Ricky, who you love. Now, tell me, how does that make any sense? That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Ricky: I never said I stopped loving you.",
        "Casey: Ok, then prove it. Tell Reese that she can go kick it with Big Ben by herself, ok, and to leave you alone. You'll do it, Ricky, if you really love me.",
        "Reese: Oh, Ricky. You're doing it again. You're talking to Casey, aren't you? You know, I made it pretty clear that I want to be with you.",
        "Ricky: Me, too.",
        "Reese: This is driving me crazy. I can't handle it.",
        "Ricky: I know it's not easy.",
        "Reese: You have a choice -- reality or fantasyland. You have to make your decision now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Madea: Now, don't worry about it, baby. I got it handled. Me and junior will make sure he won't hurt you.",
        "Imani: It's all right, Madea. He's my friend.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I tried to tell her.",
        "Imani: She's kind of stubborn.",
        "Jamal: Tried to tell him, too.",
        "Madea: And I'm not deaf, so don't talk about me like I'm not here.",
        "Imani: I'm sorry. Listen, and so are you for following me here. When did you get here?",
        "Jamal: Last night.",
        "Imani: And you've been tied up all this time?",
        "Jamal: Well, she drugged me first, and then she tied me up.",
        "Imani: Madea!",
        "Madea: Oh, I just knocked him out and hog-tied him. Ain't none the worse for it.",
        "Junior: He wasn't a problem, not even a bit.",
        "Imani: Thank you, junior. There's no need for you to stick around, but thank you for all of your help.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, thanks, man. Appreciate it, dude.",
        "Madea: Are you sure this boy's ok?",
        "Imani: He's fine.",
        "Jamal: You're right. She is stubborn.",
        "Imani: Listen -- why did you come here?",
        "Jamal: I was worried about you, ok? I couldn't just let you take off like that.",
        "Imani: That makes two of us. How on earth did you find me? Nobody's supposed to know where she moved.",
        "Jamal: I know. Nobody followed me, ok? I swear. All right, but if you show that sheriff the picture you showed me that you took in front of this place, he'll --",
        "Imani: That's how you found me?",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Imani: I should've burned that picture. I never should've shown it to you. This is a stupid thing that you did.",
        "Jamal: I know, I know. It's good to see you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, my god.",
        "Rafe: It's ok. Hey --",
        "Alison: Oh, god.",
        "Rafe: It's all right, it's all right. It was just a dream. I got you. I got you. I'm right here. It's all right. Do you remember what the dream was about?",
        "Alison: Um -- no. No, I don't -- I don't remember.",
        "Rafe: Because you said, \"I shouldn't have told you about Caleb.\" Does that ring a bell at all?",
        "Alison: I don't want to talk about it because why would anybody want to talk about something that was so upsetting? I'd rather just sort of, you know, forget about it. Ahem. But I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what I could do. I could probably make some breakfast. You know what? Why don't I make some pancakes or something. I -- I'll make us some -- something to eat.",
        "Rafe: I think I know what the problem is.",
        "Alison: You do?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, you still don't believe me that this whole war with me and Caleb is over. Right? You know, I don't blame you.",
        "Alison: You don't?",
        "Rafe: No, because, you know, every time I say it's done, you know, something else happens that just sets it all in motion again.",
        "Alison: I know, and I just -- I never want that to happen again.",
        "Rafe: And it won't. It won't. You know my pendant that I gave you?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rafe: I've had that my whole life. And that was given to me because it represented my destiny as a slayer. And when I gave it to you and said I didn't want it anymore, that was not a lie. Because for the first time in my life, I'm going to choose my own destiny. And I choose you.",
        "Alison: That's all I've ever wanted, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: Hey -- I am sorry. I am so sorry that I did this to you.",
        "Alison: No, it's not you. You didn't -- you didn't do anything wrong. I was the one who let you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reese: So, what's it going to be, the real thing or memorex? Oh, my god, you actually have to think about that.",
        "Ricky: I'm sorry, ok?",
        "Reese: Sorry? I'm losing out to a figment of your imagination. That's like losing out to a guy over a blowup doll.",
        "Ricky: Look, I just can't go with you right now, ok?",
        "Reese: Ok, so, when? Next week? Next month? You're in love with a dead woman! Which would be understandable if you were trying to get over her, but you're giving up on life.",
        "Ricky: I have to do what feels right here, ok?",
        "Reese: What feels right is you in a straitjacket in a padded cell!",
        "Ricky: Ok, you're angry.",
        "Reese: Just forget it. I'm leaving.",
        "[Ricky sighs]",
        "Casey: Hey --",
        "Ricky: Ow!",
        "Casey: Have you completely lost your mind?",
        "Ricky: What are you talking about? I just did what you asked me to do.",
        "Casey: You -- oh, my god -- you have no idea -- dude, watch it, man!",
        "Man: Sorry.",
        "Casey: Do you have any idea what you've done?",
        "Ricky: He saw you.",
        "Casey: Yeah? So?",
        "Ricky: So -- he bumped into you like -- like you were there.",
        "Casey: Ricky, I am really here.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, but normally I'm the only one who can see you.",
        "Casey: Ricky, the girl that you've been talking to definitely isn't me, and you know what? To tell you the truth, frankly, I'm pissed at you because the girl that you conjured up is pretty nasty.",
        "Ricky: What you're trying to tell me is that the girl that I've been talking to for the past two weeks isn't really you, but you are you?",
        "Casey: Oh, baby, you are so cute, but the bulb doesn't burn too bright up there sometimes. Baby, I'm the real thing, and you have a lot of explaining to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Imani: I'm sorry for leaving Port Charles the way that I did. I didn't want to put any -- I didn't want to put you in any danger.",
        "Jamal: Look, you already know about me. You know my story. I'm not afraid of any stupid sheriff.",
        "Imani: Yes, but I can't afford the distraction, and that's why I'm asking you, please go home.",
        "Jamal: Come on. Are you crazy? Look, what kind of a man would I be if I left you and your grandmother to deal with this crazy guy?",
        "Imani: We managed ok so far.",
        "Jamal: Oh, you have? Oh, ok, so you're on the run. Your grandmother -- she's moved god knows how many times. And she puts knockout drops in her collard greens when things get a little bit weird. Now, where I'm from, that's not doing ok, I'm sorry.",
        "Imani: It's really nice to see you here.",
        "Madea: Imani?",
        "Jamal: Oh.",
        "Imani: Yes.",
        "Madea: Tell the young man that he has to leave. Now, you know it has to be that way.",
        "Jamal: Well, I don't know, and I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Imani: I don't think he's going to.",
        "Madea: Not if you keep smiling at him that way.",
        "Imani: Listen, I think it'll be ok if he stays here. And, in fact, I kind of like the idea.",
        "Madea: Why?",
        "Imani: Because he came all this way to make sure I'm ok. I mean, nobody's ever done that before.",
        "Madea: Uh-huh. And if he sticks around, he's going to learn an awful lot.",
        "Imani: Well, I will make sure that he doesn't. Please, I don't -- I don't want him to leave just yet. Please.",
        "Madea: I hope you don't live to regret this.",
        "Imani: Ok. You sure you want to do this?",
        "Jamal: Yep. Although I'm a little hurt you never told your grandmother about me.",
        "Imani: There are just some things a girl can't explain, not even to her grandmother.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Imani: I'd be really happy if you stayed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafe: You did not let me down. When are you going to realize that my life is nothing without you?",
        "Alison: No, don't -- don't say that. Don't say that, please?",
        "Rafe: It's true. You're everything to me. You are. I'm just sorry that I let so many things get in the way of the one thing, the one reason that I'm really here, and that's you.",
        "Alison: You know, I think I've just made so many mistakes.",
        "Rafe: No.",
        "Rafe: No. You know what? Here's the thing -- we are what we are, and nobody's perfect. But I'll tell you something. You and me together -- we come pretty close. I'll tell you something else. I can't wait to marry you. That is -- that's what I really want. That's the only thing I want.",
        "Alison: Ok, so, to practice being a perfect wife --",
        "Rafe: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh --",
        "Alison: I mean an imperfect wife --",
        "Rafe: That's right.",
        "Alison: I will finally go make some pancakes.",
        "Rafe: Ok, sounds good. And I'm going to go shave. Don't want to scratch you up too much.",
        "Alison: How very domestic of you."
