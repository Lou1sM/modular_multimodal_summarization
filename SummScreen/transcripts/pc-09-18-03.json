        "Caleb listens in astonishment as a woman screeches her way through an audition. He welcomes her advances at first but soon pushes her away when thoughts of Olivia plague him. When Ian tries to apologize for the attack, Kevin kindly tells him to forget about it. Ian says his goodbyes to Lucy and Danny. Kevin's offer to order dinner for the kids further upsets Lucy, who doesn't consider him part of her family anymore. Casey convinces Ricky that she is real and that he's been conjuring up a nasty version of her. She wants him to straighten up and let go of the past, because she can't come back to him anymore. Casey assures Ricky that he will find love again, and she wants that for him--just not with Reese. After a goodbye kiss, Casey returns to heaven. Ricky tries to let go of the past and accept things as they are. After some initial hesitation, Olivia accepts Jack's invitation to the opening of a photo gallery tonight. While Jack takes off to run some errands, Olivia is approached by Caleb, who was looking for her."

        "Ian: Yeah, I'm all packed.",
        "Lucy: If you forget anything, you know, I can make sure and send --",
        "Ian: No, no, I -- I got all of it.",
        "Ian: I don't want to drag this out any -- I just -- I got to do a couple of things and then I'm leaving. I've just got to find the courage to do two things and them I'm --",
        "Lucy: What, what -- what are the two things?",
        "Ian: Well, I have to say goodbye to my son and I have to say goodbye to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: Oh, man, see, I don't know what's going on anymore.",
        "Casey: Baby, baby, baby, look into my eyes. I'm real. Look, touch me. It's cool. Go ahead. Now, don't tell me that didn't feel any different from when you were putting your hands on that fantasy girl.",
        "Ricky: So I dreamed her up?",
        "Casey: And I am here to set you straight. You got to let go. You got to let go -- this time for good, or else it's just going to bring you down, Ricky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. Listen, will you cover for me? Back in a minute. Hey, Livvie. Hmm.",
        "Livvie: Look who it is --",
        "Jack: Well, hello.",
        "Livvie: The jerk from the other night. What's your name again? I forget. Is it -- John?",
        "Jack: No, that's not it.",
        "Livvie: No. Joe? Jerk -- no, it's Jack, hi.",
        "Jack: Hi. The same jerk who you wished would not hate you anymore.",
        "Livvie: The same jerk who made me think he was falling in love with me again.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Livvie. You got to admit, it was a good joke.",
        "Livvie: It was a bad joke, Jack, bad.",
        "Jack: I don't hate you for saying that. I don't.",
        "Livvie: Oh, thanks.",
        "Jack: So, would you like a drink?",
        "Livvie: Chardonnay, please.",
        "Jack: So I'm guessing that you were upset because of Caleb. Just a guess.",
        "Livvie: Not everything that makes me upset has to do with Caleb.",
        "Jack: So, the other night, you -- you left me, you went back to Caleb.",
        "Livvie: How do you know where I went?",
        "Jack: Well, because I know you and it would be my guess that you tried to put the moves on him and he didn't bite.",
        "Livvie: The story of my life.",
        "Jack: Right, and now you're here with your old buddy Jack wanting his advice. Well, let me give you my advice. Next time Caleb tells you that it's over, there are two -- not one -- but two words you need to say to him.",
        "Livvie: Oh, here we go again. Ok, Jack, I'm ready.",
        "Jack: \"Thank you.\" Thank you. Thank you.",

        "Caleb: It was very -- uh, let's see, it was --",
        "Woman: It was great.",
        "Caleb: \"Great's\" a word.",
        "Woman: Come on. Am I or am I not just what you're looking for in your new steamy, red-hot band?",
        "Caleb: Oh, I think I could probably get used to playing with you.",
        "Woman: So, does that mean I pass the audition?",
        "Caleb: It might. I'd like to -- I'd like to see you work on your technique a little bit.",
        "Woman: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caleb: But I'd have to say -- well, you'd definitely be on your way to -- to great, great things.",
        "Livvie's voice: I'll haunt you wherever you go, Caleb. I'll never leave you alone. You can never get rid of me, ever.",
        "Caleb: Stop.",
        "Woman: Hey. What did I do? What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey, look what we have here.",
        "Ian: Young man, come to me. Danny boy, how are you?",
        "[Danny coos]",
        "Lucy: I have very strict instructions from Christina because they're playing school and she wants him back at his desk before he's tardy.",
        "Ian: Oh, all right, you better behave yourself. You don't want to get thrown out of school like your da. Come on, let me chat with you for a moment. You're going to be so busy playing, you won't even know I'm gone, will you? But while I'm away -- while I'm away -- Christina and Lucy are going to take care of you. All right? And in no time you're going to be back in my arms. I love you, boy. I love you.",
        "[Danny coos]",
        "Ian: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: So you came down here again -- for me?",
        "Casey: Baby, I put in the request to slap some sense into you the first day that you whipped up that mirage of me. But we've been backlogged. And actually, I'm not even supposed to be here right now, but I couldn't -- I couldn't watch you make a mess of everything.",
        "Ricky: Look, I'm trying, ok?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know you are, and you're off to a really great start, bouncing out of that vampire band.",
        "Ricky: Oh, yeah.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Ricky: The band, the band. Who needs to be on top of the charts, anyway, right?",
        "Casey: Ricky, you're the one who said you wanted a solo career, right? You wanted to be the star of your own show. Well, honey, this is it. Baby, you can do anything that you want to. Only weighing yourself down and tying your heart to the past -- it's not the way to go. I know you felt that all along.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I guess part of me always knew that I was making you up.",
        "Casey: Baby, you got to let go.",
        "Ricky: How am I supposed to do that, Casey? I love you so much. Man, I would do anything to be with you. I even went as far as making you up out of thin air. Baby, there's got to be a way that we can be together.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Yeah, sure, yeah, there's a way.",
        "Ricky: All right, then -- then tell me.",
        "Casey: Ok, it's simple, baby -- die. Finish it. Is that what you want? Is what you really, really want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: You see, you don't know a thing about my relationship, Jack.",
        "Jack: Oh, no? I know you're as addicted to Caleb as I once was to you, except I had sense enough to get out of it after being kicked in the teeth a few hundred times. See, no matter what he tells you, you always --",
        "Livvie: I know, I know, ok?",
        "Jack: Well, here's something you don't know.",
        "[Livvie sighs]",
        "Jack: As long as Caleb has the ring, he has the power, he controls the show.",
        "Livvie: I get that. So what's your point?",
        "Jack: My point is you have your whole life. You have your own show. You need to start controlling it. You need to start running it. Now. We need to find you something else to do except fawn over Caleb full-time.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, mm-hmm, sure. Like what, Jack?",
        "Jack: Like maybe you should come with me tonight. Down by the river there's a gallery opening, a photo gallery. It'll be fun. You know, maybe you should just tag along.",
        "Livvie: \"Tag\"? So it wouldn't be a date or anything, right?",
        "Jack: You can call it what you want. If you want it to be a date -- which it kind of sounds like you do want it to be a date --",
        "Livvie: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: You can do whatever you want. Or you can sit here and feel sorry for yourself and wait for Caleb. Your choice. It's time for you to start controlling your own life, be your own person. So what's it going to be, Livvie? You coming or not? Yes or no?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ian: All right. Makes it a little easier knowing he'll be ok when --",
        "Lucy: Don't -- please don't say it.",
        "Ian: It's like I told him, we're still together, we're just not living in the same place.",
        "Lucy: Ian, I --",
        "Ian: We can't take a chance. Not with the children, you know.",
        "Lucy: You're right, you're right.",
        "Ian: I will find a way out of this, I will. I -- trust me. Come here.",
        "Ian: Don't cry. I'll find a way. I have to. I love you way too much.",
        "Lucy: I love you way too much.",

        "Kevin: Christina?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: You're right, you're right, Casey. I know you are. You know, letting go is not that easy, all right? We were great. You were.",
        "Casey: Baby, I still am. And you know what? There are a lot of other kind of greats out there in this world waiting for you. Sweetie, it is time to rejoin the party. You have got a golden ticket. Say yes! Say yes, baby. Let it happen.",
        "Ricky: Let what happen?",
        "Casey: Happiness, Ricky. The life that you were born to have. There are all these kind souls waiting down here, waiting to cross your path to walk with you. Why would you want to do that all by yourself, all alone?",
        "Ricky: Hey, wait a minute. Who left who here, huh?",
        "Casey: Look, listen to me. Baby, I'm telling you, let it go.",
        "Ricky: No, no, no, no. No way, Casey, no.",
        "Casey: No, Ricky, you will find love. I know. And I can deal with that. I want that for you. I want you to feel all the love in the world in your life, sweetie.",
        "Ricky: You do?",
        "Casey: Don't you think you deserve it?",
        "Ricky: I guess.",
        "Casey: No. I know. I'm glad it wasn't with Reese, though.",
        "Ricky: Yeah. I know.",
        "Casey: But you'll find it with somebody else.",
        "Ricky: Right, because you know.",
        "Casey: But if you even mess up one more time --",
        "Ricky: I know, I know -- you'll send me a message, right? An email or something.",
        "Casey: I'll find a way. You can trust that.",
        "Ricky: I will. I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: I don't know, Jack.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. Why not? What, are you scared Caleb's going to come looking for you --",
        "Livvie: No, I'm not afraid, ok?",
        "Jack: Ok, then, prove it. Start calling your own shots, living your own life again.",
        "Livvie: Oh, Jack, it might -- it might be possible.",
        "Jack: Because it is, it is possible. What's wrong with having a little fun, going out laughing, smiling? Wait a sec. You still do know how to smile, don't you? Oh, come on, let me teach you. Do I need to teach you how to smile?",
        "Livvie: Stop it. Ok, maybe it wouldn't hurt a little, I guess.",
        "Jack: So that's a yes? Hmm?",
        "Livvie: Yes. Ok, yes. It's -- it's a yes. I -- I will go with you tonight. Thanks for asking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: What'd I do wrong?",
        "Caleb: You didn't do anything wrong. You just, it's -- ahem -- I want to thank you for coming by. I just -- I remember, there's some -- something I need to take care of, all right? You did a great job, really, thanks.",
        "Woman: But I have another song!",
        "Caleb: Great job, Olivia, of messing with my head.",
        "Livvie's voice: I'll haunt you wherever you go, Caleb. I'll never leave you alone. You can never get rid of me. Ever.",
        "Caleb: Oh, we'll see, Olivia. We'll see. I'll get rid of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky: So, I guess this is the last time that I'm going to see you. It's going to be really weird at first, turning around and not seeing you there.",
        "Casey: Trust me. You'll be just fine.",
        "Ricky: Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?",
        "Casey: Baby, my time's up.",
        "Ricky: Just give me one minute, all right? I forgot to give you something.",
        "Casey: But we can't take stuff --",
        "Ricky: Goodbye, Case. You'll always be riding behind me.",
        "Woman: Hey. Hey, you're Ricky Garza, right? Can I please have an autograph?",
        "Ricky: Sure. Why not? Hey, you got the ink, I got the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Kevin --",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. Christina called and asked me to come over. If I'd known, I never would have.",
        "Lucy: It's fine. Ian was --",
        "Ian: Ian was just leaving.",
        "Lucy: No, no, not yet. No, you're not -- not quite yet. You weren't quite ready to go.",
        "Kevin: I'm going to give you some private time. I'm sorry.",
        "Ian: Collins -- ahem -- about what happened the other day --",
        "Kevin: No, no, forget it. Let it go.",
        "Ian: All right. Well --",
        "Lucy: Uh-uh. No, I'm not ready.",
        "Ian: I'm going to leave.",
        "Lucy: Look, I -- I'm sorry. I know I wasn't going to do this and I know you're right and I'm -- I know this is the right thing, but I didn't think this would really happen, and now it's happening. Ian --",
        "Ian: There's nothing else we can do.",
        "Lucy: I know that. I know, I know.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Lucy: No, no ok. No ok, not yet.",
        "Ian: Shh.",
        "Lucy: No -- no --",

        "Kevin: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: So am I.",
        "Kevin: Well, this is a hell of a day. Lucy, is there anything I can do? I could call Mario's, have them send some food, spaghetti for the kids. It might make you feel better.",
        "Lucy: That's not going to make me feel better! I don't -- I'm going to go to Mario's and I'm going to take the kids. That will make me feel better.",
        "Kevin: You sure?",
        "Lucy: Yes, I'm sure. I'm going to take Christina and Danny and me, and we're going to Mario's.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Lucy: You know, this -- it's not ok because I'm fine with you being Christina's father and I'm fine with you being in my life and her life. But you're not my family anymore. That's not what you can call this. Ian is my family and I don't know if I'm ever going to see him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Livvie: Whoa, whoa, I say yes, and you're just going to run out like that?",
        "Jack: Easy, easy. I have a few errands I need to run. I'll be back in an hour.",
        "Livvie: I'm just making sure that you're going to guarantee me a good time.",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm your company. There's your guarantee.",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, big guarantee.",
        "Jack: Wait right here, one hour.",
