        "Eve: So this is my fault. It's my fear, my imagination that is keeping Caleb \r\nalive and making him stronger. You think I'm obsessed? You think I'm out of \r\ncontrol? ",
        "Ian: I never said that. ",
        "Eve: I am trying to protect our baby. ",
        "Ian: Our baby's fine. Look at him. He's fine. It's you I'm worried about. \r\nLook how you're behaving. ",
        "Eve: And you are behaving like what happened never really happened, that \r\nthere's no such thing as vampires and that they don't go after innocent \r\nchildren. ",
        "Ian: All right. All right. ",
        "Eve: I know what I feel, Ian. I don't know why, but I know there's a reason \r\nand I know that our child is safer at home here with us. ",
        "Ian: Why, because this isn't a public place? Because you have to invite \r\nvampires into your house? Is that it? ",
        "Eve: Yes! Please stop fighting me on this. ",
        "Ian: Fine. We'll stay in here for the rest of our lives, prisoners of a \r\nghost, and you'll be happy -- ",
        "Eve: Ian -- ",
        "Ian: And safe -- ",
        "Eve: Ian -- ",
        "Ian: And Caleb wins after all. ",

        "Lucy: Doc? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, so I know you're probably very, very angry at me for helping Eve \r\nget Ian and Eve's baby out of the hospital, but I had a very good reason. You \r\nknow, I really -- ",
        "Kevin: I'm not angry at you. ",
        "Lucy: You're not? ",
        "Kevin: No. I just want to hold you. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. I'm right here. ",
        "Kevin: I love you, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I love you very much. Are you ok? Did something happen? Where's Livvie?\r\n",
        "Kevin: She's upstairs with Jack. She's resting. Jack mentioned that he ran \r\ninto you at the catacombs, building a tomb for Caleb's spirit? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, yeah, well, Jack did most of the tombing. I sort of hammered a few \r\nnails. ",
        "Kevin: It make you feel better? ",
        "Lucy: No, not really. ",
        "Kevin: Sorry to hear that. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I wish I could just say this whole thing seems like a run of \r\nbad luck -- you know, Eve freaking out and Livvie freaking out and the snake \r\nshowing up -- ",
        "Kevin: It's not just a coincidence, is it? ",
        "Lucy: You know it's not.",
        "Kevin: I don't know what I know anymore, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I think what you mean is you don't want to know what you know. Doc, but \r\nwe can't turn away. Once the truth is out, you can't just cover it up again. You \r\ncan't un-ring a bell, and once the evil's out there, there's no going back. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Oh, Jack. ",
        "Jack: How you feeling? ",
        "Livvie: Like I'm going crazy. ",
        "Jack: Was it something you were dreaming or -- ",
        "Livvie: I'm not sure. I'm -- I'm really not sure about anything anymore. \r\nJack, I don't know what's real or what isn't. ",
        "Jack: No, you do. I know you do. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, I don't, I don't. I thought I saw that box in the catacombs \r\nand Caleb's ring, but no one else did. I'm the only one, Jack. I'm losing it.\r\n",
        "Jack: All I know is we're going to get our life back. But it's not going to \r\nbe easy. It's going to take time and it's going to take work, and I don't know \r\nhow much or how long. But what I do know is that I love you, and nothing is ever \r\ngoing to change that. ",
        "Livvie: God, I want to believe you. ",
        "Jack: Then believe it. You're safe, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Safe. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what are you saying? ",
        "Lucy: It's like I'm hearing this voice from very, very far away telling me \r\nthat things are still out of balance. They're just still out of balance. ",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe you're reading it wrong, whatever you're feeling. ",
        "Lucy: Wish I were, Doc. It's something awful and evil and dark and vengeful, \r\nlike it wants revenge coming this way. It's almost totally -- ",
        "Kevin: So Caleb is back? ",
        "Lucy: No, I don't know. It's not him. It's not him, per se. It's not a \r\nperson, but it's something very real. It may not be of this world, but it's \r\nsomething very real. The signs are all there. ",
        "Kevin: What signs? ",
        "Lucy: Livvie freaking out and Eve worried about the baby and the snake. \r\nEverything's saying the same thing. Something is coming, something's happening.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe it's just kind of a mass hysteria, Lucy -- I mean, the \r\nfeelings of paranoia and upset that all of us who came into contact with Caleb \r\nare prone to right now. ",
        "Lucy: Come on, you don't believe that. You really can't. ",
        "Kevin: No, you're right. And if there is something out there that's \r\nthreatening the people that are close to us, the people that we care about -- \r\nsome dark force -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok, listen, I -- I sort of came up with this rather wacky, far-out idea, and when I mean \"far-out,\" \r\nit's even far-out for me. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I don't care. Don't worry about far-out. If your gut is telling \r\nyou something, let's just do it. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Hey. Hey. It's ok. It's -- it's ok, all right? Everything's fine just \r\nlike it is. Let's just lay back down and try to get some rest. I'm here, I'm \r\nright here, all right? It's ok. I'm going to watch over you. Just -- just close \r\nyour eyes. ",
        "Livvie: I'm scared to close them. ",
        "Jack: Hey, don't be. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I'm almost afraid to breathe. I keep thinking if I just -- if I \r\njust lie still enough, then maybe it'll go away, maybe all the bad stuff will --\r\n",
        "Jack: I know what it's like to want to wish something away. ",
        "Livvie: Really? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Like right now, I wish you were safe enough to lie here and close \r\nyour eyes and let it all go. That's it. Everything's going to be all right. \r\nEverything's going to be just fine. You'll see. You'll see. ",
        "Livvie: Jack? ",
        "Caleb's Voice: Olivia. Olivia, come. Come to me. ",

        "Ian: Hey there, little man. You're very lucky that I'm your da. Because your \r\nmother, she is the most stubborn woman in the world. When she wants something, \r\nshe'll have it. That's \r\nsomething we'll both have to get used to. I can see it now. She'll put two pair \r\nof little woolly gloves on you and silly hats when the temperature drops below \r\n75 degrees. Lord knows what she's going to do when you start playing rugby with \r\nyour other mates, how she's going to try and keep you safe. But we have to understand she does \r\nall these silly things because she's trying to protect you. She loves you very \r\nmuch. But you already know that, don't you? Well, don't forget it, ok? Not for a \r\nminute. ",
        "Eve: You know I'm awake, don't you? ",
        "Ian: I'm looking right at you. ",
        "Eve: Well, if this is your way of apologizing, it's working. ",
        "Ian: I'm glad. Maybe now it's your turn. ",
        "Eve: I'd be lying if I said I'm sorry I took the baby out of the hospital.\r\n",
        "Ian: But? ",
        "Eve: But -- ahem -- I am sorry about the way I did it. I know that if it had \r\nbeen me, I would've been so angry, they would've had to peel me off the ceiling. \r\nCan you forgive me? ",
        "Ian: Well, that depends. ",
        "Eve: On what? ",
        "Ian: Depends on you promising that you will never do anything like this \r\nagain. This has to be a 50/50 partnership. Is that a deal? ",
        "Eve: Oh, it's a deal. I want us to be partners in every way. ",
        "Ian: Sounds like we both want the same thing. You and this wee one are my \r\nlife. Don't forget that. ",

        "Kevin: A circle of what? ",
        "Lucy: A circle of purity. Now, ok, just give me both your hands. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I don't know about this. ",
        "Lucy: I do know about this, trust me. Ok, now what you have to do here is \r\njust bear with me. And I know you can't really believe all the way, so just try \r\nnot to not believe so much that it messes things up because we really want to get \r\nanswers here, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Fair enough. I'll take them any way I can get them. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Kevin: What's next? ",
        "Lucy: All right, I'm going to read from my spell book, ok, and chant \r\nsomething, so just bear with me, all right? ",

        "Lucy: Yep. Yes, I know what I'm saying -- \"evil, show yourself.\" Stop. ",
        "Kevin: Exactly. I thought we were supposed to banish evil, not invite it in.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Doc, we want to find out what kind of evil we're dealing with. This \r\nspell will bind this dark spirit to something that it can manifest itself so it \r\ndoesn't hurt us. That's what I'm trying to do. At least that's what I think I'm \r\ntrying to do. ",
