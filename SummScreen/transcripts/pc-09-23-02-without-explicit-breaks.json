        "Ian: Frank's out of control. The avatar's taken over completely. We have to\r\nstop him.",
        "Karen: So what's your plan this time, Ian? Tie him up? Throw another net over\r\nhim? Let him burn in a fire --",
        "Ian: I don't want to hurt him, Karen, but I don't want him to hurt other\r\npeople, either. We have to get to the source of his power. We have to take away\r\nthe shroud.",
        "Karen: So what can I do? I already begged him to give up the avatar's spirit.\r\nHe won't.",
        "Ian: Take it away from him.",
        "Karen: He won't let me do that.",
        "Ian: You have to take it away from him without him knowing that you will.",
        "Karen: Frank's still the man I love, Ian. I can't do this to him.",
        "Ian: The man you love almost killed Chris Ramsey tonight. We can't let that\r\nhappen. We got to stop him.",
        "Doree: You look rotten.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.",
        "Doree: I'm just glad you pulled through.",
        "Chris: Thanks. Me too. Ah.",
        "Doree: God, that's got to hurt.",
        "Chris: Yeah, only when I breathe.",
        "Doree: You know what? I'm going to go get a nurse and see if we can't get you\r\nsomething to make you feel more comfortable.",
        "Chris: Yeah, good.",
        "Chris: That was fast. Oh, no.",
        "Frank: Hi there, Christopher. I think we have a little unfinished business.",
        "Rafe: I feel so lucky just to be standing with you here right now and to have\r\nnothing but love in your eyes coming towards me after everything that I did.",
        "Alison: No, Rafe. No --",
        "Rafe: You know what? Loving you is like breathing. And just as much as air or\r\nwater, you give me life.",
        "Alison: Oh, Rafe.",
        "Rafe: It's the purest, most holy thing that god ever created, that -- that\r\never happened to me ever. And I love you. I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Alison: Well, now, if you'd like to, you may kiss your bride.",
        "Rafe: My wife. My Alison.",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Alison: Rafe. Rafe? Rafe?",
        "Rafe: My angel --",
        "Alison: Rafe? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Rafe. Oh, my god. You've been shot.\r\nRafe? I need to go -- I need to go get help. I need to call 911.",
        "Rafe: No. No. Don't go. Just -- just stay with me. Just stay.",

        "Chris: What do you want?",
        "Frank: Uh, uh, uh -- I'll get that. Don't strain yourself.",
        "Chris: You're here to finish the job, aren't you?",
        "Frank: Hey, the avatar's one of the good guys. Don't you read your own press?\r\nI wasn't trying to kill you.",
        "Chris: Yeah, right.",
        "Frank: Oh, if I wanted to, I could have.",
        "Chris: Get out of here, frank.",
        "Frank: You never should have pushed the avatar like that. Never offer to\r\nbecome its host.",
        "Chris: I only offered because I thought it would be glad and Karen was so\r\nhell-bent on retiring you.",
        "Frank: You tried to take something important away from me. The avatar won't\r\nlet that happen.",
        "Chris: Don't blame this on an ancient spirit. This is you, pal. This is all\r\nyour anger that put me here. What are you doing?",
        "Frank: You tried to take what's mine. I am warning you, Ramsey -- do it\r\nagain, and I'll be visiting you at your grave.",
        "Doree: The nurse will be right in. Is everything ok in here?",
        "Frank: Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Just checking on an old buddy. Now, you\r\nremember, try not to overdo it, or you'll never get out of here. Bye.",
        "Doree: Chris, there's something we really need to talk about.",
        "Chris: Doree, I'm too tired to talk right now.",
        "Doree: Then I'll do the talking, ok? I mean, we both know we've had our ups\r\nand downs, but I'm here because I care about you.",
        "Chris: Is that right?",
        "Doree: Yes. But I'm a cop, too. Ok? Somebody hurt you real bad, so I need to\r\nknow -- who did this to you?",
        "Karen: I'm sorry, Ian, I can't betray frank's trust. You have to find some\r\nother way to take that damn shroud away from him.",
        "Ian: He is one step away from killing somebody. We both know it.",
        "Karen: He's just upset. He'll calm down.",
        "Ian: He's what? He's what? He's upset? Well, let's hope he calms down before\r\nsomeone else ends up in the hospital, or maybe the morgue. Can you honestly say\r\nthat that is the same frank that you fell in love with? He's been a dear friend\r\nto me, and I think we're going to be more sympathetic than the police will.",
        "Karen: What do you mean by that?",
        "Ian: If he keeps going the way he is, they're going to kill him. They're\r\ngoing to kill him, Karen. And if he's the man you love -- or if he was the man\r\nthat you love, you got to get him back, you got to do this for him.",
        "Karen: It just doesn't feel right, Ian. Ok, ok, look -- look, I'll consider\r\nthis on one condition, ok? That frank walks away from this free and clear. Look,\r\nit's not his fault this thing has taken him over, ok? He's not to be punished,\r\nunderstand?",
        "Ian: All right, all right. All right. If we can get to the avatar, destroy\r\nthe shroud, I will protect his identity, I promise you.",
        "Karen: After all we've been through; frank and I deserve a chance together.",
        "Ian: I know. Get rid of the avatar, you can have frank back; you can have a\r\nlife together.",
        "Karen: So if I do this, how will it work?",
        "Ian: You find Frank; you talk to him and convince him to become the avatar.",
        "Karen: And when he does, I get the shroud?",
        "Ian: And Rafe and I will take care of the rest. Don't worry. It'll be fine.",
        "Karen: If I do this, I'll be betraying the man I love. How could that be\r\nfine?",
        "Livvie: I didn't mean to do it! Rafe made me do it. It's all his fault.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!",
        "Livvie: He shouldn't have left me. Because I'm his wife and a man doesn't\r\nleave his wife. God, what have I done? What have I done?",
        "Alison: You need a doctor.",
        "Rafe: No, no -- all I need is you. All these amazing memories are coming back\r\nto me now.",
        "Alison: You really need some help.",
        "Rafe: You -- you and me -- the first time we kissed. I mean, the first time\r\nwe really kissed. Do you remember that? You -- you asked me what it was that I\r\n-- I really wanted more than anything. And all I could see was this beautiful\r\nwoman sitting in front of me. And I had completely fallen in love with you. And\r\nall I could think about was holding you and kissing you. Remember?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I remember every single second, every -- every kiss we ever\r\nhad. And when we made love.",
        "Rafe: And that day on the beach.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I remember the day on the beach. You were holding me so close\r\n-- so close to your heart, and the sun -- it was shining, and we really felt\r\nlike it was shining just for us that day. And I thought to myself, this must be\r\nwhat heaven is like.",
        "Rafe: And -- and then we made a sandcastle and I said I wished that we could\r\n--",
        "Rafe and Alison: Live in that house forever.",
        "Alison: And we will. We will. We will. Come on, just let me get you help.",
        "Rafe: No, I'm ok.",
        "Alison: Don't argue with me now, please.",
        "Rafe: I'm -- I'm ok.",
        "Alison: Please.",
        "Rafe: I'm ok. I'm better than I have ever been. Ok? Because I have the most\r\nimportant thing with me. I have you. Ok? I have you, and that's the most\r\nimportant thing in the world. In the -- in the universe. And I have all of our\r\nmemories. And that makes me the luckiest man who ever lived.",
        "Alison: But please, please, let me go get you some help. Please, Rafe. Please\r\n-- no, don'T. Please.",
        "Rafe: No, there's not much time --",
        "Alison: I'm not ready! Don't say that, please.",
        "Rafe: I -- I have to -- I have to tell you something because we might never\r\nsee each other again. And just so I could come back to you, there were certain\r\nchoices I had to make. And I know -- I know that -- that life on earth is a lot\r\nshorter than life in eternity, but I just needed to see you. I wanted to see you\r\nso -- so badly, so -- I'm sorry -- I made a deal. I made a deal, and I did it\r\nbecause I love you.",
        "Alison: Ok. Shh.",
        "Rafe: I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Alison: Shh. I know. I know. Listen. Listen to me, Rafe. Listen. I know, I\r\nknow. Shh, shh. I know -- I know what you did. I know what you did for me. And\r\nyou're not lost. Ok? You came through. You fell in love with me again. You saved\r\nus both.",
        "Karen: I'd never hurt you, frank. You know that in your heart. But I've got\r\nto fight for you, no matter what it takes.",
        "Frank: Karen.",
        "Karen: I didn't hear you.",
        "Frank: You're crying. What's wrong? What's gotten you so upset?",
        "Rafe: I don't think you understand. I sold my soul to be with you.",
        "Alison: I know. But I don't think it ends with the bargain that you made.\r\nRafe, I got a sign. I really did. I got a sign that said that if you fell in\r\nlove with me again, then your soul would be spared, and you did it. You really\r\ndid it, against all the odds. You didn't have your memory and against everything\r\nthat livvie did, you still did it because your love brought us back together\r\nagain. Because you and I -- we're one soul, we're one heart forever.",
        "Rafe: I just wanted to come back to say good-bye because we never really got\r\na chance to say a real good-bye.",
        "Alison: Listen, I will never forget you -- ever. I will love you for the rest\r\nof my life. And every morning when I wake up, in my heart, I will kiss you\r\nawake. And every night, when I go to sleep, I will say a prayer for you. Ok? I'm\r\ngoing to be ok. I'll be down here, and I will live life for both of us. Rafe, it\r\nwas selfish of me to have called you back, and I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: No, no, no -- I -- I would have come back anyway.",
        "Alison: Shh. Shh, shh, shh. I'm so grateful that you are here so that we\r\ncould say good-bye. And even though I will miss you forever, it's ok. I'm ready.\r\nI want you to go. I want you to go back to where you belong. I want you to go\r\nhome.",
        "Alison: Shh.",
        "Rafe: I have never loved another woman, I have never called anyone else wife\r\nin my heart.",
        "Alison: My sweet husband.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "Alison: Shh.",
        "Rafe: Hold my hand.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Rafe: Hold my hand.",
        "Alison: Ok. Shh, shh. It's ok. Come here. Come here. Shh.",
        "Rafe: I will always love you.",
        "Alison: Ok. Shh. Shh. Come here. Come here. Shh. Good-bye, my angel.",
        "Alison: May god be with you.",
        "Doree: You're protecting lancelot, aren't you?",
        "[Chris groans]",
        "Doree: How can you defend a lowlife who nearly rubbed you out?",
        "Chris: I'm not protecting --",
        "Doree: God, you're protecting this loser with a stupid hero complex!",
        "Chris: No, I'm not protecting him, I'm protecting you.",
        "Doree: Me?",
        "Chris: Yes, ok? Whoever did this was -- was a maniac, and I don't want him to\r\nhurt you, too.",
        "Doree: Hello? I'm a cop. I can take care of myself.",
        "Chris: Yeah, ok, well, then fine. Maybe I just would like to do one thing\r\nright by you. If you got hurt, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself. I -- I'm\r\nnot going to put you in danger.",
        "Doree: Wow. Now I remember.",
        "Chris: Remember what?",
        "Doree: What it was that made me like you in the first place.",
        "Chris: It's not the sex?",
        "Doree: Yeah, that, too. Definitely. But the simple truth is that I just\r\nreally like being with you.",
        "Chris: Well, I would like being with you more if you could change the\r\nsubject, please. Why don't you tell me a jo..",
        "Doree: Ok, I've got one. Um -- what about the one of the stubborn idiot of a\r\ndoctor who actually turned out to be a halfway decent guy?",
        "Chris: Who would believe that one?",
        "Doree: I would.",
        "Karen: You came because you knew I was scared, didn't you? You can always\r\nsense that.",
        "Frank: I know you're frightened of what's inside me. But you don't have to\r\nbe.",
        "Karen: When I'm with you, I'm not scared.",
        "Frank: I remember it took me so long to get up the nerve to kiss you the\r\nfirst time. I always felt like you were so far out of my league. You were scared\r\nthen, too, remember? Scared to get involved. You'd been so hurt.",
        "Karen: You have always been there for me.",
        "Frank: Because I love you. No matter what's happened to me, Karen, remember\r\nthat. And if you're frightened, I will make it better.",
        "Karen: Frank, I'm just so confused.",
        "Frank: We can work anything out if you trust me the way I trust you.",
        "Karen: This is breaking my heart.",
        "Frank: Come home with me, Karen. Ok? Let's -- let's just be together, the way\r\nit used to be, and I can prove to you that you can trust me.",
        "Karen: No, I can'T. I can't do this.",
        "Ian: Rafe, if you're there, pick up the phone. It's the third message I'm\r\nleaving for you. You got to call me back. Call me back the minute you get this.\r\nIt's very urgent. I found a way to beat the avatar, but I need your research to\r\ndo it. So call me. Where the hell are you?",
        "Ed: Welcome back, son.",
        "Paramedic: Miss? Miss, are you hurt?",
        "Second paramedic: We got a report of a shooting.",
        "Alison: Oh. No. No, there's -- there's nothing wrong here. That must be some\r\nmistake.",
        "Paramedic: But we got a call.",
        "Alison: You're more than welcome to take a look around. Everything's fine.",
        "Paramedic: Well, this looks like a false alarm.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Paramedic: Are you sure you're ok?",
