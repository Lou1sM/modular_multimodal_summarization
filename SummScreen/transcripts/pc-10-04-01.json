        "Lucy: Rafe, come on. I just -- I want to\r\nknow how you do it. How do always show up just when I need you? How do you know\r\nthat? \n\n",
        "Rafe: You already know the answer, Lucy. \n\n",
        "Lucy: What, that we're vampire slayers so\r\nwe have this highly tuned, highly developed sense of intuition? \n\n",
        "Rafe: Now, what do you really want to know?\r\n\n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. I want to know why did you really\r\nand truly come to Port Charles. \n\n",
        "Rafe: I told you -- I thought you might\r\nneed me. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, right -- right after you found\r\nout I evoked evil to the house. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Which I drove out of your house. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Yes, you did, and thank you very\r\nmuch. But that's not the end of the story. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Ok, what are you seeing? \n\n",
        "Lucy: I see normal people not acting\r\nnormal. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Which normal people do. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Sometimes, but there's a reason\r\nbehind it. Rafe, I can just feel it. Even my Doc. \n\n",
        "Rafe: What, Kevin? What about him? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Do you know he's so strong. I can\r\nalways count on him. He's always calm. He's the calmest person I know and I\r\ncount on that and I love him for it. \n\n",
        "Rafe: But? \n\n",
        "Lucy: But he's acting crazy. It's like he's\r\nobsessed or possessed or -- \n\n",
        "Rafe: Or what? \n\n",
        "Lucy: I don't know, but there is something\r\nbehind this. People -- it's like people everywhere are acting crazy. It's like\r\nsomething's stalking all of us. And I get the feeling that you might know\r\nsomething about this.\u00a0",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Eve: Ok, I finally got Danny down. He\r\nshould sleep for a couple hours now. \n\n",
        "Ian: Fingers crossed. \n\n",
        "Eve: Yeah. Did you get all the picnic\r\nleftovers put away? \n\n",
        "Ian: Yes, I did. Now it's our time to relax\r\nwith the boy-o dreaming. \n\n",
        "Eve: Actually, I think I should use this\r\ntime to write some more thank-you notes for the baby gifts. \n\n",
        "Ian: No more thank-you notes. You need to\r\nrest, ok? \n\n",
        "Eve: No. I'm not tired. I've got a million\r\nthings to do. I should sterilize some more of Danny\u2019s bottles -- \n\n",
        "Ian: You sterilized two dozen of them\r\nyesterday. \n\n",
        "Eve: And I don't have to do it every time,\r\nI know. \n\n",
        "Ian: When the baby's resting, the mother\r\nshould be resting, too. You know that, Doctor. \n\n",
        "Eve: I said I know, Ian. \n\n",
        "Ian: Good. Now, I have a couple of hours\r\nbefore I go back to the hospital, so why don't you go in there and get some\r\nrest. \n\n",
        "Eve: Damn it! Stop telling me what to do! \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "[Kevin turns off engine] \n\n",
        "Kevin: How's this? All right? \n\n",
        "Woman: Thank you for driving us out here. I\r\nknow it felt like a strange request. \n\n",
        "Kevin: It's a little strange. Who are you? \n\n",
        "Woman: My name's Anne-Marie. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, how are you connected to Ian\r\nThornhart? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: We -- we were involved back in\r\nAfrica. \n\n",
        "Kevin: So it was your husband that Ian was\r\naccused of killing? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: And he got away with it. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Are you saying that\r\nit wasn't self-defense? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: I saw it happen, Dr. Collins.\r\nHe killed my husband in cold blood. And then he thought he killed me, as well. \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Chris: Here we go, Doctors. Read it and\r\nweep. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Great. Next week's schedule. \n\n",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. Yes, any complaints you\r\nhave, just file it in that little, gray metal basket under my desk. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Whoa, wait, wait, wait a minute. You have me here for another\r\nall-nighter tomorrow. \n\n",
        "Chris: Yeah, I do. Them are the breaks. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Oh, really? Well, Chris, your schedule looks pretty light. \n\n",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, that's one of the perks\r\nof being the chief resident. You remember being the chief resident, don't you,\r\nKaren? \n\n",
        "Ian: Dr. Ramsey, I got those lab results\r\nyou wanted. \n\n",
        "Chris: Oh, hey, thank you very much.\r\nAppreciate it. Take care. Ciao. Bye-bye. So long. Pack up, right out. See you. \n\n",
        "Ian: Does everybody hate him? \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Pretty much. \n\n",
        "Ian: Glad I\u2019m not the only one. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Hey, Jeff, what exactly was it you just gave Chris? \n\n",
        "Jeff: Oh, he ordered a complete panel on\r\nGabriela Garza. Hand-delivered, stat. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 A full panel? Why is he so interested in Gabby\u2019s blood? \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Chris: Final results are in. There's no\r\ntrace of any of the unknown elements present in Gabby\u2019s original blood sample,\r\nwhich, in effect, means I did it. I actually did it. I -- I isolated all the\r\ncorrect factors. I now know what makes a vampire a vampire. And the secret is\r\nright here in my hand along with the incredible future of fame and fortune,\r\nadded extra bonus of eternal life. So all we need now is a guinea pig. A human\r\nguinea pig. \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Kevin: He thought he killed you, too? What\r\nhappened? In fact, go back even further. How did you meet Ian? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: We worked together in a village\r\nin West Africa doing good work, helping people. I was a nurse. My husband and I,\r\nwe had been having difficulties, but we were trying to work things out. Ian --\r\nhe has this way about him. He can be so charming, make you believe almost\r\nanything. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Go on. \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: I was fighting my attraction to\r\nhim. In fact, I was going to break things off when one day we were taking a walk\r\nand these men appeared from nowhere. Next thing I know, Ian and I were being\r\nheld captive -- or so I thought. \n\n",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: He set the whole thing up. He\r\nwanted me, and when he realized I was pulling away, he arranged to have us\r\nkidnapped. \n\n",
        "Kevin: How does your husband figure into\r\nthis? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: He found out. He helped me\r\nescape. When Ian found us, he was enraged. My husband tried to fight him, but\r\nIan killed him. I ran. He pushed me in front of a car and left me there to die.\r\nAnd now I'm afraid he's going to do it again. The minute Eve disobeys him, he's\r\ngoing to try to get rid of her, too. \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Ian: What's the matter with you? We just\r\nhad a nice day in the park. All I'm asking you is to get some rest. \n\n",
        "Eve: Ordered me. \n\n",
        "Ian: I what? \n\n",
        "Eve: Ordered me, and in that tone. \n\n",
        "Ian: What tone is that? \n\n",
        "Eve: That tone you use when you think that I\r\ncan't take care of Danny just because I want to sterilize some extra baby\r\nbottles. \n\n",
        "Ian: No, you're making more work for\r\nyourself. \n\n",
        "Eve: I know as much about bacteria as you\r\nor any other Doctor. \n\n",
        "Ian: You think that maybe you're\r\noverreacting a little? \n\n",
        "Eve: No, I don\u2019t. I need you to believe\r\nin me, to trust me to take care of Danny. \n\n",
        "Ian: I trust you to take care of him. But\r\nwhy is it that every time I make a suggestion, you want to bite my head off? \n\n",
        "Eve: Because I know what you're thinking! \n\n",
        "Ian: You don't know what I'm thinking. This\r\nis like walking on eggshells around here. This is crazy. \n\n",
        "Eve: What? So now I\u2019m a lunatic? \n\n",
        "Ian: I didn't say you were a lunatic. \n\n",
        "Eve: Oh, well, if you say I am, then I\r\nguess I am! There! \n\n",
        "Ian: Lambert, what are you -- \n\n",
        "Eve: I'm a lunatic now, right? I'm crazy.\r\nBecause you said so I must be crazy. Well, I might as well live up to your\r\nexpectations. Look, I'm crazy. Danny, watch out, your mommy's crazy because Daddy\r\nsaid so! She's crazy, crazy, crazy! \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Rafe: I told you everything you need to\r\nknow already, Lucy, honestly. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Are you absolutely sure? \n\n",
        "Rafe: You tell me. Go on, look at my eyes.\r\nYou still think I'm lying to you? \n\n",
        "Lucy: No. No, you're not lying to me. But\r\ndon't you feel it? Don't you feel something all around us that isn't right? \n\n",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I sense something, but I don't\r\nknow Port Charles as well as you do. You tell me what you're feeling. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. I don't know. I can't describe it\r\nspecifically. It's just everybody is not acting like themselves. Like Doc -- he\r\ngets this anonymous letter, bad things about Ian that Ian could have done, and\r\nnow he's -- right now he's running around trying to prove that it's true. \n\n",
        "Rafe: How do you know it's not? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ian's our friend. He would never just\r\nturn his back on a friend like that. He's got to let this -- this anonymous\r\nletter and this mystery woman just go. \n\n",
        "Rafe: You think it's something bigger. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah. \n\n",
        "Rafe: And this is coming between Kevin and\r\nyou. \n\n",
        "Lucy: It could. Yes, I believe it could,\r\nand that's not the only thing. There's Livvie. She told me she's having these\r\nhallucinations about seeing Caleb\u2019s ring everywhere. Don't you see? This can't\r\nall be happening at exactly the same time. It can't be a coincidence. \n\n",
        "Rafe: You may be on to something. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, thank God. Ok. Thank you. Finally\r\nsomeone sees what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling. All right, the question is,\r\nwhat are we going to do about it? \n\n",
        "Rafe: I have a feeling you already have\r\nsomething in mind. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I do. See, I know I was in way over\r\nmy head. I mean, I was out of my league completely when I conjured that evil\r\nspirit before. Rafe, you and me together, we could find out what this thing is.\r\nWe could conjure it up and track it down and find out what it wants. Come on,\r\ntell me, what do you say? \n\n",
        "Rafe: I'd say you have a death wish. \n\n",
        "Rafe: You're telling me you're ready to\r\njump back in and just open the door to darkness, even after the last time? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, no, I'm not just going to open\r\nthe door. I'm not going to do it just in my home. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Just leave it alone, Lucy. Read my\r\nlips -- you chase after darkness, and all it will do is lead you into the dark. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I can't just leave it alone. People I\r\ncare and love are in trouble. I need to help. I can't do nothing. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Of course not. We have to fight, but\r\nwe have to fight in the right way. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok, good. So tell me how. How? \n\n",
        "Rafe: When the time comes, I'll let you\r\nknow. \n\n",
        "Lucy: When the -- when the time comes? No,\r\nyou need to tell me now before all our lives fall apart again. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Lucy, if you want my help, you have\r\nto swear to me that you won't try to summon some forces you don't understand\r\nagain. \n\n",
        "Lucy: No, I can't promise you if you won't\r\npromise to help. I cannot promise you that. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Listen to me. I'm not here to\r\nbargain. Now, you either do what I say or I go right back to where I came from. \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm not saying that I don't believe\r\nyou, but you're painting Ian to be some kind of a monster. \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: That's exactly what I\u2019m\r\nsaying. This surprises even you, doesn't it? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, why come forward now after all\r\nthis time? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: I've always kept my eye on Ian\r\n-- from a distance. But when I found that he'd had a child, I knew I couldn't\r\nkeep my peace. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Hold it. You're\r\nsaying that Ian would hurt his own son? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: Ian is capable of anything. As\r\nlong as he gets and does what he wants, he doesn't care who he hurts. I bet Eve\r\nLambert thinks that he loves her. Even Ian may believe it. He pretends to be so\r\nnoble and honorable, but his love won't last. As soon as he starts to feel that\r\nhis partner isn't completely under his control -- \n\n",
        "Kevin: All right, hold it, hold it. That's\r\nenough. I've heard enough accusations, and no more anonymous letters. I'm going\r\nto clear this up right now. I'm taking you to see Ian. \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: No. No, you can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\r\nHe thinks I'm dead and that's the way I want it after what he did to us. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Yes, you and your husband. \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: And my baby, the child I was\r\ncarrying. My husband's child. \n\n",
        "Kevin: What? \n\n",
        "Anne-Marie: No, don't look at me. When --\r\nwhen he pushed me in front of that car, he killed my baby! \n\n",
        "Kevin: Anne-Marie, no. No, wait!\r\nAnne-Marie, wait! I need to know more! \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Eve: How's that? Crazy enough for you? \n\n",
        "Ian: You almost done with your little\r\ntantrum? \n\n",
        "Eve: How dare you talk to me like that. \n\n",
        "Ian: Like what? An infant? That's how you\r\nacted. \n\n",
        "Eve: And you are acting like some\r\noverbearing, over-testosteroned -- \n\n",
        "Ian: Well, this isn't about me right now,\r\nis it? I'm not the one throwing things. This is about you. \n\n",
        "Eve: No, this is about you acting like some\r\ngeneral barking out commands like he's got a stick up his pants. We are all\r\nwrong, right? You're the only one that's right! The rest of us are a bunch of\r\nidiots! \n\n",
        "Ian: Well, if that's what you're hearing in\r\nyour own little private world over there, maybe it's because you're not showing\r\nthe right judgment lately. Start with taking Danny out of the hospital without\r\ntelling me. \n\n",
        "Eve: We went over this. \n\n",
        "Ian: Then this little tantrum, and locking\r\nyourself outside the apartment with Daniel still in here and having to, what,\r\ncall the fire department? This has nothing to do with you being a good mother or\r\na bad mother or any kind of mother. This is about you getting a grip. \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Chris: To inject or not to inject. That is\r\nthe question. Whether it is nobler to suffer the side effects for myself --\r\neternal life, incredible strength, hypnotic powers of seduction. Or -- oh, no.\r\n\"Or.\" What am I talking about? There is no \"or.\" If I've\r\ndone all my work properly, then -- hey, I got nothing to lose. It's all the\r\npowers of a vampire without the -- the thirst. Yeah. Sounds like a good deal to\r\nme. Come on, Ramsey. No guts, no glory. Here we go. Everlasting life and more\r\npower than any mere mortal has ever known. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Hey, Ramsey, let's hear it. Why'd you order the extra lab\r\nwork? \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen -- \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Oh, my god. What the hell are you doing? \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Eve: Get a grip? \n\n",
        "Ian: You heard me. \n\n",
        "Eve: You insensitive pig. Any mother would\r\nbe overprotective after fighting a monster like Caleb! \n\n",
        "Ian: I understand that. \n\n",
        "Eve: How dare you use what happened to us\r\nagainst me! \n\n",
        "Ian: I said I get it, Eve! I understand why\r\nyou're upset. What I don't understand is why you want to let it out on me. \n\n",
        "Eve: I don't know why I\u2019m doing this, ok?\r\nI don't know why I feel the way I feel! I just do! And you're right, we had a\r\nbeautiful day in the park. We did, and the minute we got back into this house,\r\neverything changed. It's like this day never happened. I don't know why I feel\r\nthe way I do. I don't know why I\u2019m out of control, Ian. I don't know what's\r\ncome over me. I just feel the way I feel and I don't know why. I don't know why.\r\n\n\n",
        "Ian: It's all right. \n\n",
        "Eve: No, it's not. It's not all right. \n\n",
        "Ian: As long as we're all right, it's all\r\ngoing to fall into place. You don't have to come up with all the answers by\r\nyourself. I'm here. You can lean on me. It's my job. Ok? Come on. \n\n",
        "*******************************\n\n\n\n",
        "Chris: This is not what it looks like. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 What else can it be? I saw what I saw. \n\n",
        "Chris: Yeah, I know, but you got it wrong,\r\ntrust me. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 You were this close to shooting up. \n\n",
        "Chris: If you'll just let me explain,\r\nthere's a good -- \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Explain? Oh, you bet you'll explain -- if not to me, then to\r\nAlan. \n\n",
        "Chris: No, we don't have to bring Alan -- \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 What are you taking? \n\n",
        "Chris: Those are my notes. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 What are you on? \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen, give me my notes, please. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 What is this? How can you still be doing research on\r\nvampires? \n\n",
        "Chris: Well, that's none of your business,\r\nis it? \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Oh, my god. That's why you wanted Gabby\u2019s blood. You're\r\nstill trying to figure it out, aren't you? After all the misery and destruction?\r\n\n\n",
        "Chris: You don't understand. I can't just\r\nlet something just walk away from me when I\u2019m -- I'm this close to changing\r\nthe world. Don't you understand that? I mean, I have the fountain of youth by\r\nthe tail right here. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Are you out of your mind? \n\n",
        "Chris: No, if you look at those numbers,\r\nI've isolated all the right factors. It just has to be tested now. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Well, you can\u2019t. You don't know what you're doing, what\r\nwill happen. \n\n",
        "Chris: It's worth a gamble. \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 I can't let you put that stuff in your system. \n\n",
        "Chris: Well, you really can't stop -- Karen\r\n-- \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 The hell I can't. \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen, let go! \n\n",
        "Karen:\u00a0 Help, somebody, help! \n\n",
        "Chris: Damn it, let go! \n\n",

        "Rafe: I'm going to leave town right now if\r\nyou don't start listening. \n\n",
        "Lucy: All right, all right! Ok. Ok, I\r\npromise. I won't use any more spells or conjure up the dark. All right, I\u2019ll\r\ndo it. I'll just find another way. \n\n",
        "Rafe: You're not just saying that to get me\r\noff your case? \n\n",
