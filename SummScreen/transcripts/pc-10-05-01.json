        "Caleb:\r\nYour father didn\u2019t Even recognize you, Olivia. He sat and listened as you\r\nmasqueraded as Anne-Marie, and he beliEved you. No one will Ever suspect you, my\r\nlove. And they're nEver going to know what hIt them. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nCaleb? \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nI'm right here, sweetheart. \n\n",

        "Kevin:\r\nEve? Well, as long as you're here, might as well see If there's anything that\r\nbacks up Anne-Marie's story. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nAll right, Karen, you hang with me now. Don't you go ruining my life and my\r\ncareer with one shot. If there was a vampire serum, that was meant for me, not\r\nyou. I'm the one who did the research. I'm the one who extracted all the\r\nelements, the right elements, from Gabby\u2019s blood. I'm the one who was supposed\r\nto test It. A little adrenaline for you. I don't know If It's going to do any\r\ngood, but, hey, I got nothing to lose. Come on, Karen. Come on. Come on, Karen.\r\nHey, there you are. All rightly. \n\n",

        "Chris:\r\nHey, It's ok. Wexler still, ok? \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nWhere am I? What's going on? \n\n",

        "Karen:\r\nNow? What -- \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, slow down. Look, you got a bunch of adrenaline running\r\nthrough your system, ok? You collapsed, ok? I just -- \n\n",

        "Chris:\r\nWell, not exactly. No, you came rushing Into my office and It was -- \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nGabby's blood tests. I -- I remember. I came In here to see what you were up to,\r\nwhy you ordered them. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nKaren, listen to me. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nYou had a syringe and you were going to Inject yourself with something. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nKaren? \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nBut you stuck me Instead. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nWhoa! No, no, no! You back up, doctor! You stuck yourself! It was an accident!\r\nWe were wrestling over the needle! \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nMy god, what did you dome? What did you shoot me up with? \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nI didn\u2019t shoot you up with anything! \n\n",

        "Karen:\r\nBlood? \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nYeah, just a few, you know, elements that I Isolated from Gabby\u2019s old sample. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nOld -- Gabby\u2019s old -- vampire blood? I'm Infected with vampire blood? \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nNo, of course not! I think I screened out all the bad parts. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nYou think? \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nHey, listen -- \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nOh! \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nThis Is nobody's fault, ok, but It did happen, so let's just -- let's just try\r\nto go from here and make It -- make It a positive, right? Look, let me take your\r\nvitals and we're going to be fine. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nGet that lousy thing away from me! \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nKaren? Ok, take a deep breath. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\n\"Deep breath\" nothing. Were you out of your mind? What were you\r\nthinking fooling around with vampire blood? \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nHey, Karen, I wasn't fooling around -- \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nWhat the hell did you do to me? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nWhat am I trying to do? I can't Even think straight. All I can think about Is\r\nlivvie. You know what? I'm going to call her. I'm going to call her just to make\r\nsure she got there ok. Hospitals. All right. I'm sure she's all right. M sure\r\nshe made It ok. Yeah -- hello? Yeah, I'm looking for one of your patients'\r\ndaughters. Yeah, her name's livvie -- Rachel Locke\u2019s daughter. Well, what do\r\nyou mean she hasn't been there? I mean, when did she leave? At all? No, no, no.\r\nNo, are you sure she hasn't been there? Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nGod. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nJack. Oh, my god. What's wrong? What's going on? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nI'm -- I'm sorry. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nAre you all right? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nYeah. I was just calling because livvie was going to go visit her mom, and I\r\njust wanted to make sure she got there ok. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nYeah, and? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nShe's not there. No one's seen her. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, what, she hasn't, like, got there yet, or what? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nNo, she lied to me. She -- she didn\u2019t go see her mom. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, where did she go? Where Is she? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nThat's the point. I don't know. No one knows where she's at. She didn\u2019t want\r\nme to know. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nNo, Jack, I'm sure that's not -- \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nYes, Alison, I can feel It. I'm losing her. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nBetter dream? Good. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBut I -- I think I have to go because Jack, he'll worry. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nThat's because he doesn't trust you -- not like he should. That's the problem\r\nwith temporary beings, Olivia -- their love, their trust -- It's also temporary.\r\n\n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBut It's because of what you're doing to them. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nYes. And as my enemies get weaker, I feel my strength flooding back. Oh, It's a\r\nrush, sweetheart, almost as good as sex. Almost. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBut sooner or later, they're going to figure out It's you. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nThat won't happen, my love. They're too busy mistrusting each other. I've given\r\nthem just enough truth for the lies to seem believable. I've taken the seeds of\r\nfear and doubt In their secret hearts. The spark's already there. All we have to\r\ndo Is fan the flames. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nYeah, but they're my friends and family. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nI'm all you need now. Our souls are entwined. And we have an eternity together\r\n-- you, me, and the child we deserve. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBut I don't want you to do this anymore. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nSoon you'll understand. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nNo. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nYes! Yes, you will, because that's the way has to be. Do you understand me? Do\r\nyou understand me? ( Yawns; sniffs ) \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWhat are you talking about? You are not losing livvie. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nI'm not so sure, Alison. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, I am. I mean, look, maybe aye livvie just needed some space, you know? I\r\nmean, sometimes I do. As much as I love Jamal and I love being with him, I mean,\r\nsometimes you just sort of need to take a step back for a second, you know, and\r\nkind of look and see what's going on Inside. You know what I mean? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nIt sounds like something\u2019s going on with you and Jamal. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nNo, we're not talking about me and Jamal. We're talking about you and livvie.\r\nAnd plus, why are you getting so crazy about this? Maybe she's just changed her\r\nmind. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nShe thinks I'm smothering her. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, Is she right? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nWell, yeah, I mean, I guess. It's just because Everything that's happened\r\nlately. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWhy? What has happened? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nThe other day, I went to the catacombs, and I found her naked all alone. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWhat? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nAlison, she didn\u2019t know how she got there. She didn\u2019t know where her clothes\r\nwere. And that's why I've had my eye on her. That's why I've been watching her. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWhether or not she did It on purpose or not or whether she went to go see\r\nRachel, you know, and lied about It or not, Jack, It really sounds like there's\r\nsomething wrong with her. I think that we should split up and go look for her\r\nnow. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nNo, Alison, I've already done that. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, that was before. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nI've already tried following her around 24 hours a day and It doesn't work. I've\r\ntried that. And Caleb still got to her. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nCaleb Is dead. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nYeah, but, Alison, It feels like the same thing all over again, only I don't\r\nknow what's behind It. I just have to figure out a different way to help her\r\nout. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, do you have any Ideas? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nI wish I did. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, don't worry, ok? They will come to you soon, but just don't -- don't drive\r\nyourself crazy trying to come up with them, ok? You love livvie. And, Jack, I\r\nbeliEve In you and -- and what you and livvie share together. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nRight. \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nYou love each other, Jack. Ok, focus on that. \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nYou think I should go look for her? \n\n",
        "Alison:\r\nWell, It doesn't really matter what I think. What do you think? \n\n",
        "Jack:\r\nI think -- ok, got keys. You are a great friend. I'm going to go find my girl. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nLook at me. \n\n",
        "Now!\r\n\n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nIt hurts when you fight me. I don't mean to raise my voice. It's just I'm\r\nstruggling. I'm trying to get my strength back so we can be together. If there\r\nwas another way -- \n\n",
        "livvie:\r\nBut there has to be. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nThere Isn\u2019t. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nIt just -- It feels so wrong hurting Everybody. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nOh, no. You can't think of It that way. Mainly, they're hurting themselves. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nOnly If I could tell them. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nDon't betray me, Olivia. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBetray? \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nI won't allow It. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nI just feel so -- \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nGuilty? But I've taken care of that. When you walk out of here, your mind Is\r\nempty. You don't remember. You shouldn't feel guilt, the most annoying of all\r\nhuman emotions. What more can I do? \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nYou can find someone else. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nThere Is no one else. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBut I -- \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nShh. Shh. You are uncomfortable now. But soon you're going to realize how weak\r\nthose people are that you're trying to protect. You'll be disgusted by how\r\neasily they fall In and out of love. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nBut Jack -- \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nWill stop loving you. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nNo. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nAnd I'll be here for you. When all of our enemies have fallen, I'll be the one\r\nhere. And our family will finally come together. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\n\"Our\" family? \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nVery soon, Olivia. We'll have our rEvenge and a child to raise. Our prize, my\r\nlove. Our family. Our child. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\n\"Our\" child? \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nI promise you'll hear from me soon, my love. But until then, you won't remember\r\nbeing with me. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\n\"Won't remember.\" \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nNow hurry. Go. \n\n",
        "Livvie:\r\nYes. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nGood girl, Olivia. Good girl. \n\n",
        "Kevin:\r\nCome on, Ian. Would you deliberately hurt someone just because she questioned\r\nyou? \n\n",
        "Kevin:\r\nWhat are you doing? What are you doing? You know Ian better than this. You're\r\ntaking the word of a stranger. \n\n",
        "Kevin:\r\n\"Dear Ian, you didn\u2019t have to kidnap me to make me fall In love with you.\r\nLove, Anne-Marie.\" Oh, my god. Maybe she was telling the truth. \n\n",
        "Caleb:\r\nIt won't be long now before I take whatEver pleases me again. The day of\r\nreckoning Is coming. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nKaren, you got to calm down. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nI won't calm down. I can' you pumped me full of vampire blood! \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nHey, nobody pumped anybody full of anything. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nMy god, who knows what's going to happen to me, what I'll turn Into -- \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nHey, well, If you keep rushing around like this, It's only going to get Into\r\nyour system faster. \n\n",

        "Chris:\r\nKaren, you're not thinking straight. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nOh, no? I wonder why, Chris. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nLook, don't you get It? I mean, If you go out there and get the word out too\r\nfast, you're going to be blowing an once-In-a-lifetime opportunity. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nA what? \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nKaren, this could be huge. If the two of us can unlock the secret together,\r\nwe'll be millionaires. \n\n",
        "Karen:\r\nIf you don't get out of my face right now, you're going to need Every penny to\r\nkeep yourself alive after I rip you apart. \n\n",

        "Karen:\r\nLosing your license will be the least of your problems. After the hospital Is\r\ndone with you, you're going to jail. I'll make sure of It. Now get out of my\r\nface. \n\n",
        "Chris:\r\nKaren? Come here. You can't -- \n\n",
