        "Rafe's voice: You chase after\r\ndarkness and all it'll do is lead you into the dark. \n\n",
        "Lucy: How can I do that? How\r\ncan I just ignore such a strong feeling that something's wrong? How can anybody\r\nignore especially we're vampire slayers. We're supposed to fight evil. \n\n",

        "Ian: Oh, you know. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I know because --\r\nwell, last time I saw her, she's too overwrought and anxious. Is she doing a\r\nlittle better, I hope? \n\n",
        "Ian: Sometimes and sometimes\r\nshe just turns on a dime. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Like something's going\r\nto happen. \n\n",

        "Ian: I know what she went\r\nthrough with Caleb. I know what. She's the bravest woman in the world for it.\r\nBut she needs to know that that's over now. Things are back to normal. But be\r\nthat something invisible is stalking her. \n\n",
        "Lucy: What if Eve is right?\r\nCome l \n\n",
        "Lucy: No, what if I told you\r\nright now that i know what's behind it? \n\n",

        "Lucy:, A very evil force. \n\n",
        "Ian: Caleb's gone. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I know, but he left\r\nbehind something Even darker, for all of us. I'm sure of it. \n\n",
        "Ian: And how would he do that?\r\n\n\n",
        "Lucy: I don't know, I don't\r\nknow. I just know it's there, and we have to find it before it finds us. And you\r\nthink I'm absolutely crazy. \n\n",
        "Ian: I do. \n\n",
        "Indeed, but i thought that\r\nvampires being real was crazy also. \n\n",
        "Lucy: So you believe me? \n\n",
        "Ian: I didn't say that, Lucy. \n\n",
        "Lucy: No -- no, you didn't,\r\nbut you didn't say you don't. Come on, we have somewhere we need to go. Come on,\r\nlet's go. Let's go Ian: Uh -- \n\n",
        "Eve: Are you going to answer\r\nmy question, Kevin? What are you doing here? \n\n",
        "Kevin Uh, the door was open\r\nand, you know, I thought something might be wrong. \n\n",
        "Eve: Ok, first of all, given\r\n's happened, i.e. sure i locked that door, and second of all, it looked like you\r\nwere going through our stuff, so try again. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Ok. Someone sent me an\r\nanonymous letter who said she was involved with Ian in Africa. \n\n",
        "Eve: I know all about her. Ian\r\ntold me about her. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Wait -- wait a minute.\r\nWhat do you mean you know all about her? \n\n",
        "Eve: Ian told me that he\r\nwalked in on her husband beating the hell out of her and he stepped in to\r\nprotect he a much different story. \n\n",
        "Eve: What? U met her? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Just a little while\r\nago. \n\n",
        "Eve: No. Ian told me that she\r\ndied, Kevin. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Well, she was\r\nvery much alive when i met her. Name is anne-marie, and her story is that Ian\r\nher husband in cold blood and then tried to kill her. \n\n",
        "\u00a0\n\n",
        "Rafe: Excuse me. Have you seen\r\nLucy Coe? \n\n",
        "Ender: Yeah, she here a le\r\nwhile ago but left in a hurry. \n\n",
        "Rafe: Where'd you go, Lucy?\r\nWhere'd you go? \n\n",
        "Rafe: No, Lucy, don't go\r\nthere. No, not the woods. \n\n",
        "Ian: I can't believe I let you\r\ndrag me all the way out here. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, you wouldn't have\r\ndone it if you thought i was 1,000% wrong. \n\n",
        "Ian: Ok, now here we are. Now\r\nwhat? Lucy: Ok. It's a ritual. Doc and I did this ritual at the lighthouse. \n\n",
        "Ian: You got Kevin to do a\r\nritual? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, and it worked. I\r\nactually evoked eve \n\n",
        "Ian: Hmm, how do you know that\r\n-- it sat down, had a beer with you? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Do you want to do this\r\nor do you not? \n\n",
        "Ian: Sorry. Go on \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. I really did. I\r\nmean, I actually evoked evil because I could feel it. I felt i and Kevin saw it.\r\n\n\n",
        "Ian: He saw it? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Yes. It was in the room.\r\nIt was like a shadow passed across the mirror, and then mysteriously, the mirror\r\nbroke. It shattered into bits and i -- I knew it. I felt that evil was in our\r\nhouse and -- listen, maybe that's what's wry with your house. Maybe there's evil\r\nin it and that's what Eve's feeling. It could be. What do you say? \n\n",
        "Ian: Well, I say what is this\r\n-- this ritual of yours? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok, good. Hold the\r\nlight. All right, first i start out by putting a circle of purity -- these\r\nstones represent purity -- and I have to make the circle completely around this.\r\nAnd then you -- your job , attempt to completely clear that big, fat head of\r\nyours of the doubt. Please, just try ok? Then -- here, give me this. We hold\r\nhands and we concentrate and we focus. And I try to evoke the evil presence. \n\n",
        "Ian: Lucy, let's say it\r\nobliges you, all right? Let's just say that. What do we do then? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Um -- that's easy. I\r\ndon't know. No, I -- i mean, i know what we do. We send that evil presence right\r\nback tell, where it belongs. \n\n",
        "Eve: I don't believe you. Some\r\nwoman you don't Even know tells you a crazy story about Ian, and you think it\r\ntrue? \n\n",
        "Kevin: I understand, but she\r\nwas very convincing. \n\n",
        "Eve: No. She's a liar. Or an\r\nimposter -- both! Ian told me that you have been asking questions about how he\r\nand i got together and now this. \n\n",
        "Kevin: It's all part of the\r\nsame thing, Eve. \n\n",
        "Eve: Did it Ever occur to you\r\nthat this woman had a crush on Ian at some point, he didn't return the favor,\r\nand so now she's trying get back at him for rejecting her or something? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Yes, it did occur to me\r\nand I'd be inclined to believe it if it weren't for this. That's a picture of\r\nanne-marie. \n\n",
        "Eve: So? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Read the back. \n\n",
        "Eve: \"Dear Ian, you\r\ndidn't have to kidnap me to make me fall in love with you. Love,\r\nanne-marie.\" \n\n",
        "Chris: How's she doing? \n\n",
        "Alan: Her blood pressure fine.\r\nPulse is strong and regular now. Ok. Now tell me, what happened? \n\n",
        "Chris: I'm not really sure.\r\nShe just got faint. I don't know. \n\n",
        "Alan: Really? Then why would\r\nshe be afraid of you? \n\n",
        "Chris: She wasn't afraid of\r\nme. We just had a disagreement over some research. I guess I pushed my point too\r\nhard, and she got all worked up. \n\n",
        "Alan: You know, it wasn't too\r\nlong ago that a bunch of doctors came to me, including you and Karen, and told\r\nme about some very strange happenings. I mean, really strange. Now, i assume,\r\nbecause i hadn't heard from anybody, that the problem was resolved. Am i wrong? \n\n",
        "Karen: I can answer that,\r\nAlan. I'll tell you what Chris is up to. \n\n",
        "Jack: Here. Ok. So, ahem, you\r\nsaid that you remember going to see your mom. Right? Yeah, but you kept walking.\r\nWhy? \n\n",
        "Livvie: I think that maybe you\r\nwere right about what you said -- that i was just going to get hurt again. \n\n",
        "Jack: By seeing Rachel? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I know she's\r\ncatatonic and can't respond to me, but -- \n\n",
        "Jack: You were kind of hoping\r\nfor a miracle. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I think so.\r\nBecause I know that seeing her like I did -- all well and happy -- was just an\r\nillusion that Caleb put in my head. But I think a part of me deep down was just\r\nhoping that there'd be some kind of a sign or -- \n\n",
        "Jack: That be she was getting\r\nbetter. \n\n",
        "Livvie: That she'd be the way\r\nshe was in my head, only for real this time. \n\n",
        "Jack: I hate that Caleb\r\nmanipulated your feelings. \n\n",
        "Livvie: He knew I really\r\nwanted a family. And he gave me a lie. \n\n",
        "Jack: I know -- I know how\r\nthat f. I mean, we both have never had a mom or a dad or, I mean, the whole\r\nfamily thing. But you know what? We can change that. \n\n",
        "We can have that family. And I\r\nwant that more than anything. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Me too. \n\n",
        "Jack: Kids and all. All right?\r\n\n\n",
        "Livvie: God, I love you. \n\n",
        "Jack: I love you, too. \n\n",
        "[Crash] \n\n",
        "[Livvie screams] \n\n",
        "Eve: So what is this supposed\r\nto mean? \n\n",
        "Kevin: I think you know as\r\nwell as i do. Eve, when did you and Ian really fall in love? When you were\r\nkidnapped, right? \n\n",
        "Eve: Are you saying that Ian\r\nset this whole thing up? Kevin, that's crazy. \n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm saying that he\r\ncould have done the same thing to that woman. And when her husband found out,\r\nIan could have killed him. \n\n",
        "Eve: That is insane, Kevin! \n\n",
        "Kevin: Eve, please -- \n\n",
        "Eve: No, this is some sick,\r\ninhuman joke! \n\n",
        "Kevin: I wish that were true. \n\n",
        "Eve: I want you to get out of\r\nmy house. I want you to leave right now, Kevin. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Pravus prebeo statim.\r\nPravus prebeo statim. Evil presence, show yourself. \n\n",
        "Ian: You used that one five\r\nminutes ago. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I know because that's\r\nthe one that always has worked. It works. \n\n",
        "Ian: It's not working now, is\r\nit? \n\n",
        "Lucy: No. It doesn't make any\r\nsense, though. It just doesn't make any sense because this is where it started.\r\nRight here is where it all began. I can feel it. \n\n",
        "Ian: Maybe it's bowling night.\r\n\n\n",
        "Lucy: You know, you can just\r\nmarch yourself right out of here and go home. \n\n",
        "Ian: Ah, I'm sorry. I know\r\nyou're trying to help, but -- \n\n",
        "Lucy: So, what are you saying?\r\nThank you, but no thank you? \n\n",
        "Ian: I'm saying that maybe\r\nthis is just a case of people being out of sync with each other. \n\n",
        "Lucy: I don't -- ok. I think\r\nyou're right. So, why don't we just go home? What are you going to do about Eve,\r\nthough? \n\n",
        "Ian: What i'm going to do is\r\ngo home and tell the people that are important in my life how much i love them.\r\nMaybe you should do the same. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Right, ok. Good idea.\r\nThat's what I'm going to do right now. I'm going to get my stuff. Ok. Let's get\r\nout of here. \n\n",
        "Ian: Ok. \n\n",
        "Lucy: You know, I'm going to\r\ngo the opposite way. I'm going to run by Kevin\u2019s. \n\n",
        "Ian: Take care, Lucy. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. Here i am. This is\r\nwhat you wanted, isn't it? You wanted me here by myself. So here I am. Come on,\r\nshow yourself. I'm not afraid of you at all. \n\n",
        "[Footsteps] \n\n",
        "Alan: So, how are you feeling\r\nnow? Your blood pressure went pretty low when you fainted. \n\n",
        "Karen: I'm fine. \n\n",
        "Chris: Still, you know, you\r\nprobably should get some rest. Why don't I get a room ready for you, ok? \n\n",
        "Karen: I'd rather talk about\r\nyou, Chris. \n\n",
        "Chris: I already explained to\r\nAlan -- \n\n",
        "Alan: I'd like to hear what\r\nKaren has to say. So what happened? \n\n",
        "Karen: Chris and I were\r\narguing about a research project he's working on -- a real interesting one, huh,\r\nRamsey? \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen -- \n\n",
        "Karen: You know how Chris\r\npushes the wrong buttons, Alan. Anyway, it was a simple scholarly discussion,\r\nbut Chris was so patronizing, I just overreacted. \n\n",
        "Alan: And that's what caused\r\nyou to faint? \n\n",
        "Karen: On top of coming off of\r\na double shift and barely eating all day, I guess so. But I feel great now,\r\nreally. \n\n",
        "Alan: And you were so depleted\r\nand tired just a few minutes ago. \n\n",
        "Karen: If you're suggesting a\r\nchemical reason like drugs -- go ahead, check my blood. \n\n",
        "Alan: No, I believe you. You\r\ngo home and get some rest. If I find out anything else is going on -- \n\n",
        "[door closes] \n\n",
        "Chris: Thank you. Thank you so\r\nmuch for not telling Alan. You did the right thing. \n\n",
        "Karen: Uh-huh. \n\n",
        "Chris: You know, you were\r\ninjected with the compound i came up with, so we really ought to run some tests.\r\nIt would be exciting if you think about it. Ok, it's all the good aspects of\r\nbeing a vampire without the need to hunt and kill for blood. How are you\r\nfeeling? \n\n",
        "Karen: Like i told Alan,\r\ngreat. \n\n",
        "Chris: \"Great?\"\r\nWell, how great? I mean, how -- can you describe it? \n\n",
        "Karen: Sorry, got to go,\r\nChris. \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen -- Karen, wait. \n\n",
        "Eve: I'm not kidding, Kevin.\r\nGet out and take this picture with you. \n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry I'm upsetting\r\nyou, Eve, but I'm not the bad guy here. \n\n",
        "Eve: Neither is Ian. \n\n",
        "Kevin: I hope you're right.\r\nAnd I hope to god that i'm wrong. I want there to be an explanation for this. \n\n",
        "Eve: There is. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Then you owe it to\r\nyourself and to Danny to find out what that is. I'm here if you need me. You\r\nknow that. \n\n",
        "Eve: You are wrong, Kevin. \n\n",
        "Eve: It's all a bunch of lies.\r\n\n\n",

        "Ian's voice: It's time you\r\nknew about some things. \n\n",
        "Eve's voice: Like what, the\r\ntime you stole a piece of candy from the corner drugstore in Ireland? \n\n",
        "Ian's voice: I was once\r\naccused of killing a man. \n\n",
        "Ian: How is my beautiful wife?\r\n\n\n",
