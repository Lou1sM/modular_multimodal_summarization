        "Kevin: All right, Lucy. Just\r\n-- just back up a little bit and tell me what you mean by -- a near-death\r\nexperience? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Ok, yeah, well, it was\r\nkind of a vision because you know how we're sort of, Rafe and me, we're kind of\r\njoined, you know, psychically. It's like our minds -- it's so cool -- we meld\r\ntogether. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy. Fast forward. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Rafe had a vision that\r\nhe shared with me. He showed me my own death. \n\n",
        "Kevin: What did Rafe say that\r\nmeans? \n\n",
        "Lucy: It means that I have to\r\nstop messing around with evil or that's how I'm going to end up. He did it to\r\nscare me. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, it's working on\r\nme, let me tell you! Lucy, just do what Rafe says and stop fiddling around with\r\nevil -- spirits. Lucy, he caught you doing it, didn't he? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, I was taunted. I\r\ncould feel that evil presence taunting me, so I went out and I called it out. \n\n",
        "Kevin: You did what? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, nothing happened.\r\nRafe showed up and he showed me the ghost of Lucy future. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, he showed you how\r\nyou can avoid that, right? \n\n",
        "Lucy: Yes, I have to stop\r\ndealing with evil. Just get away -- I plan to. I mean, like nobody's business,\r\nbut, doc, I can't get that image out of my head. It really did scare me. \n\n",
        "Kevin: All right, all right.\r\nLook, Lucy, there is no way I'm losing you. So that's it. No more hocus-pocus\r\nand no more field trips into the woods, all right? \n\n",
        "Lucy: No, no, no, no, no. I\r\npromise, I promise. Listen, I just have this other feeling I can't shake. \n\n",
        "Kevin: What do you mean? \n\n",
        "Lucy: I think Rafe was trying\r\nto tell me that I'm not the only person in danger. \n\n",
        "Ian: I'm not accusing you. I'm\r\nreminding you that we need to be extra careful with Daniel. \n\n",
        "Eve: Like how I wasn't careful\r\nwhen I locked myself outside the loft and Danny inside. \n\n",
        "Ian: I'm not saying that. You\r\njust haven't been yourself lately. \n\n",
        "Eve: Well, maybe that has\r\nsomething to do with your past, all the little secrets that keep popping up. \n\n",
        "Ian: You're welcome to ask me\r\nanything you like about my past. \n\n",
        "Eve: I'm sorry. I think I just\r\nneed some caffeine. \n\n",
        "Eve's voice: So what is this\r\nsupposed to mean? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Eve, when did you and\r\nIan really fall in love? When you were kidnapped, right? \n\n",
        "Eve: Are you saying that Ian\r\nset this whole thing up? Kevin, that's crazy. \n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm saying that he\r\ncould have done the Same thing to that woman. And when her husband found out,\r\nIan could have killed him. \n\n",
        "Eve: That is insane, Kevin! \n\n",
        "Ian: Well, I don't know if she\r\ncan handle that right now. I'll break it to her gently. I'll find you. \n\n",
        "Eve: Who was that on the\r\nphone? \n\n",
        "Ian: The hospital. They want\r\nme to go in there early, so I got to go. \n\n",

        "Eve: I've been thinking about\r\nwhat you told me about Anne Marie. I haven't been able to stop thinking about\r\nthat. And now Ian is acting strange. I really need to talk to you. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Ok. Meet me in my\r\noffice. I'm on my way. Lucy, I'm sorry, I have to go to work. \n\n",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. You're\r\nleaving me? I just told you I had a vision of my death, and this whole town is\r\nhaunted by the mother of all satanic forces, and you're ditching me? \n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. It's an\r\nemergency. \n\n",
        "Lucy: It's an emergency, fine.\r\nI'm just going to sit right here and watch a whole parade of demons waltz by my\r\nface. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, it's like Rafe said -- if you don't invite evil in, it won't come in. So please don't put out\r\nany invitations, all right? \n\n",
        "Lucy: No way. No, I'm on a\r\ncrystal and white light from here on out. That's my diet right there, ok. \n\n",
        "Kevin: I won't be long. \n\n",

        "Chris: What do you think\r\nyou're doing? \n\n",
        "Karen: Well, what's wrong,\r\nRamsey? You haven't seen a naked woman before? \n\n",
        "Chris: Just not this\r\nparticular naked woman. I've never seen you so uninhibited. \n\n",
        "Karen: Well, I can remember a\r\nfew staff Christmas parties. \n\n",
        "Chris: I must have achieved the right balance in the drug mixture I was looking for. I mean, you look great.\r\nNo fangs, no cravings. \n\n",
        "Karen: Hmm, no. Just your\r\nbasic, healthy all-American girl. \n\n",
        "Chris: Yeah, who might stay\r\nthat way for decades, thanks to a little nip of vampire blood, huh? \n\n",
        "Karen: Hmm. \n\n",
        "Chris: Listen, I know you\r\nfreaked out before when I wanted to examine you, but in the name of science -- \n\n",
        "Karen: Sure. I'll let you look\r\nin the name of science. \n\n",
        "Chris: You mean it? \n\n",
        "Karen: But first, I need to\r\ntake a shower. And you know what? I could really use a sandwich from the\r\ncafeteria. \n\n",
        "Chris: I'll get you that\r\nsandwich. Then we get to work, ok? \n\n",
        "Karen: I'll meet you in your\r\noffice. \n\n",
        "Chris: Oh. Somewhere there is\r\na big, old private jet with my name on it. Maybe a noble prize. Or better yet,\r\nmagazine covers. Going to need a press agent. \n\n",
        "Ian: Mary. \n\n",
        "Mary: Oh, Ian. I'm so glad you\r\ncalled. \n\n",
        "Ian: What'd you find? \n\n",
        "Mary: Well, I got some great\r\nnannies for you. And, you know, all new mothers could use a helping hand. \n\n",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know it. So this\r\nis the one you said just quit her job. \n\n",
        "Mary: Oh, that was a terrible\r\nsituation. The mother was keeping the baby sick so that she could get attention.\r\nYou know, the Muchausen syndrome by proxy. \n\n",
        "Ian: I've never actually seen\r\na case. \n\n",
        "Mary: First the mother's\r\nsymptoms were diagnosed as postpartum depression. She was distracted, overly\r\nprotective. But she was purposely creating life-and-death dramas in her life and\r\nthe life of the child. \n\n",
        "Ian: So others could save her?\r\n\n\n",
        "Mary: Right. \n\n",
        "Ian: So the mother would make\r\nthe child suffer for attention. \n\n",
        "Mary: That's right. Well, you\r\nlook over those resumes and let me know what you think, ok? \n\n",
        "Ian: I will. Thanks, marry.\r\nThanks again. \n\n",

        "Ian: Yeah. \n\n",

        "Ian: I'll take it. I'm going\r\nup there in a few minutes anyway. Thanks, Tracy. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Good. I got here as\r\nsoon as I could. \n\n",
        "Eve: Ok. I talked to Ian about\r\nAnne Marie and the kidnapping thing. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Did you tell him that I\r\nspoke to her? \n\n",
        "Eve: No. Why? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Because she's terrified\r\nof him. \n\n",
        "Eve: Well, I didn't give her\r\naway -- or you for that matter. \n\n",
        "Kevin: You know what? Right\r\nnow, I don't care if Ian knows that I talked to you about her. Never mind. What\r\ndid he say? \n\n",
        "Eve: Well, it was all\r\nperfectly innocent. He told me that he kidnapped her away from work so that they\r\ncould go on a picnic together. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Do you believe him? \n\n",
        "Eve: Of course I do! He's my\r\nhusband! \n\n",
        "Kevin: Ok, ok. But what about\r\nyou\u2019re kidnapping? What did he say about that? \n\n",
        "Eve: How am I supposed to\r\naccuse the man I love of being a liar and a cheat when he's not? \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, if you believe that, why are you here? Eve, you're afraid of your own husband. \n\n",
        "Jack: I've got a surprise for\r\nyou tonight that will wipe away all your fears. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Now, that's got to be\r\nsome big surprise. So why don't you tell me? \n\n",
        "Jack: Hmm, no. No hints. I'm\r\ngoing to make a few calls, and I'll be right back. \n\n",
        "Livvie: No! Come on, jack.\r\nDon't keep me guessing. Please. \n\n",
        "Jack: Uh-uh. You wait right\r\nthere, and I'll be back. \n\n",
        "Alison: I'll just be one\r\nminute. Hi. What's going on? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Jack is being very\r\nmysterious. \n\n",
        "Alison: Hmm. \n\n",
        "Livvie: You know something,\r\ndon't you? \n\n",
        "Alison: No. I don't, I swear.\r\nI know nothing. Um -- but just make sure that you wear some really nice, you\r\nknow, beautiful dress that will make his eyes pop. You know what I mean? \n\n",

        "Kyle: Right, right. I'm glad I\r\nran into you again. I was wondering if you'd like to have some dinner or\r\nsomething. \n\n",
        "Livvie: You know, actually,\r\nI'm seeing someone and -- here he is. \n\n",
        "Kyle: Sorry. \n\n",
        "Livvie: Ok. \n\n",
        "Kyle: Ok, well, take care. \n\n",
        "Jack: Ok. Am I going to have\r\nto take this guy, knock some sense into him? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Well, he is really\r\ncute, but not really my type. \n\n",
        "Jack: And what's your type? \n\n",
        "Livvie: Well, a guy who works\r\non motorcycles and has really funky hair and great lips. I got to go. \n\n",

        "Chris: What did you do? \n\n",
        "Karen: Well, what does it look\r\nlike? I've been going through your files. You know, pretty awesome stuff. Good\r\nread. According to this, the results of the first injection you gave me should\r\nlast for weeks, months, maybe forever. \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen, what are you\r\nthinking? \n\n",
        "Karen: Oh, oh -- and in case I\r\nneed another shot, I did take the rest of your precious serum. But don't worry.\r\nIt's in a safe place -- not that I don't trust you or anything. \n\n",
        "Chris: Do you have any idea\r\nwhat you've done? \n\n",
        "Karen: Yeah. Put you out of\r\nbusiness. \n\n",
        "Chris: Karen -- Karen, if you\r\nhad any moral qualms about all this, why didn't you just report me to Alan or\r\nthe police? Why would you do this? \n\n",
        "Karen: I didn't trash your\r\nnotes because I had moral objections. I did it because I don't want to share the\r\ngood stuff with anybody else. \n\n",
        "Chris: You're not going to get\r\naway with this. \n\n",
        "Karen: What are you going to\r\ndo, Ramsey? Report this to Alan? Oh, or maybe the cops? You know, I don't think\r\nthey'll look too kindly at you playing god or making vampires in your basement.\r\nThanks for the sandwich. You know, I really worked up an appetite. See you. \n\n",
        "Chris: What the hell have I done? \n\n",
        "Eve's voice: So this is my\r\nfault. It's my fear, my imagination that is keeping Caleb alive and making him\r\nstronger. You think I'm obsessed? You think I'm out of control? \n\n",

        "Eve: I thought I heard this\r\nnoise out in the hallway. So I went out to go see what it was, and before I knew\r\nwhat was happening, the door slammed shut behind me and it locked. It locked\r\nDanny in here all by himself, and he started screaming and crying, and there was\r\nnothing I could do to get to him. I check that monitor 50 times a day. Look, I\r\ndon't know what happened, but it was on. \n\n",

        "Eve: I'm making a big deal out\r\nof nothing. I do trust my husband and -- and I just had a baby. It's probably\r\nhormones. I'm overreacting! I've been known to do that. \n\n",
        "Kevin: But, Eve, are we\r\nsupposed to just ignore the fact that what happened to Anne Marie may have\r\nhappened to you, too? I met this woman, Eve. She is scared to death. She's\r\nafraid that Ian might find out that she's still alive. \n\n",
        "Eve: No, this sounds like some\r\nsort of bad movie. \n\n",
        "Kevin: Well, where do you\r\nthink writers get their ideas for bad movies? From life. Now, look, just -- just\r\nstep back for a moment. Before you and Ian were kidnapped, we were married. \n\n",
        "Eve: Oh, god. Don't go there. \n\n",
        "Kevin: No, you don't\r\nunderstand. I love Lucy with all my heart, but, Eve, you and I were in love\r\nonce, too. \n\n",
