        "Livvie: Caleb?",
        "Caleb: Here, my love.",
        "Livvie: Why did you call me?",
        "Caleb: Well, I wanted to see you. But not like this. Hey. You look sad.",
        "Livvie: It\u2019s Jack. He -- he\u2019s left me. He\u2019s gone.",
        "Caleb: Gone?",
        "Livvie: And I don\u2019t know how it happened. I mean, I don\u2019t remember how I\r\nended up in bed with a guy that I just met. Caleb, you have to tell me, did you\r\ndo this? Did you make Jack stop loving me?",
        "Caleb: No, Olivia. I didn\u2019t make him do anything. Sometimes life is like a\r\ntest, and it would seem that Jack has failed his.",
        "Livvie: A test?",
        "Caleb: That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you all along. This boy\u2019s love for\r\nyou is shallow and fleeting.",
        "Livvie: He loved me completely. He promised forever. If I hadn\u2019t messed up\r\n--",
        "Caleb: You made a mistake -- one mistake -- and he\u2019s gone. How\r\n\"forever\" is that? You're starting to see it now, aren\u2019t you? Just\r\nlike all the others. What they thought is true love is, in reality, conditional\r\nat best -- here today, gone tomorrow. But what we have is different, Olivia.\r\nWhat we have is a love that will never die.",
        "************************************************",
        "Eve: Ian --",
        "Ian: Did I hear you right? You're leaving me?",
        "Eve: I can\u2019t be with a man who doubts me, a man who thinks I would\r\ndeliberately hurt my own child.",
        "Kevin: He what?",
        "Ian: Stay out of this, Kevin, please.",
        "Kevin: I\u2019m already in it.",
        "Lucy: Doc, you got to stay out of this. This is between Eve and Ian.",
        "Ian: Thank you. Speaking of doubting people -- you now think I\u2019m some\r\nkidnapper?",
        "Eve: I can\u2019t speak to you right now, Ian.",
        "Kevin: And you know what, Eve? You don\u2019t have to. You've come to me for\r\nhelp. You have it. You can stay here as long as you need to.",
        "Ian: Well, this is perfect, isn\u2019t it? Just the way you planned. Here she\r\nis, coming back to you, just running back to you.",
        "Eve: I am not running to anyone.",
        "Ian: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Eve: Maybe I feel at home here. Maybe I feel safe. This was once my home\r\nbefore --",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know, I know. I forgot. Before the kidnapping that I set up to\r\nset up -- break up your happy family. Hmm. Very good. Maybe -- maybe Kevin\r\ndoesn\u2019t care about Lucy.",
        "Kevin: All right, that\u2019s enough. Get out!",
        "Ian: Is that what this is about? You two wishing that things had turned out\r\ndifferently?",
        "************************************************",
        "Rafe: Anybody there? I asked you for help and I still haven\u2019t heard from\r\nyou. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s frustrating, you know? I mean, here I am, an angel\r\nsent down here by you to do a job -- to protect Lucy and stop Caleb. Only\r\nhere\u2019s the thing -- I can\u2019t do this job because of all these -- forgive me,\r\nbut all these really lame rules I got to follow! Now, Caleb\u2019s regaining his\r\npower and I can\u2019t do a thing to stop him. So you tell me -- what\u2019s the point\r\nhere, huh? I mean, why didn\u2019t you just send me down here blindfolded with my\r\nhands tied behind my back? Hello? Is anybody listening? Can anybody hear me?\r\nWell, if you can, hear this -- this job sucks!",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Man: Are you hearing me? I don\u2019t really care if Sinatra is booked. I need a\r\nreal hard-ass for this assignment, and he\u2019s it.",
        "Rafe: It\u2019s about time.",
        "Man: What the hell do you want? I\u2019m busy.",
        "Rafe: I\u2019ve been trying to reach you for days, sir. See, it\u2019s about this\r\nassignment.",
        "Man: What about it?",
        "Rafe: Truth be told, sir, I\u2019m not really happy with it. See, it\u2019s these\r\nrules.",
        "Man: Excuse me? You're not really happy? You asked for this assignment. You\r\nbegged me for it.",
        "Rafe: I know, sir, but --",
        "Man: You said you wanted to rid the world of this dirt bag who took your life\r\n-- this vampire, remember?",
        "Rafe: Caleb, yes.",
        "Man: Said you'd do whatever it took, whatever it needed.",
        "Rafe: Oh, that -- that\u2019s true, sir, but --",
        "Man: Yeah, that\u2019s great. Then get back to work.",
        "Rafe: I can\u2019t do that.",
        "Man: You can\u2019t what?",
        "Rafe: See, things have changed, sir. I can\u2019t just guide Lucy anymore.\r\nCaleb\u2019s too powerful. She needs to be warned. They all do. They need to know\r\nthat he\u2019s coming back!",
        "Man: Forget it.",
        "Rafe: With all due respect, sir --",
        "Man: No, with all due respect, that\u2019s not the way we work here. Yours is\r\nonly to steer. You do not drive.",
        "Rafe: That\u2019s just it. It\u2019s all these pointless rules. And Caleb -- he has\r\nnone! I mean, what\u2019s up with that?",
        "Man: Sorry, kid. Deal with it.",
        "Rafe: Fine. If you won\u2019t help me, I\u2019ll just do this on my own. I\u2019ll do\r\nwhatever I think is necessary to protect these innocent lives. That means to\r\nhell with the rules! Sir.",
        "************************************************",
        "Eve: First you accuse me of harming my own son, and now you think I\u2019m\r\nplotting to get back with Kevin?",
        "Ian: Is that any more ridiculous than what he\u2019s whispering in your ear?",
        "Kevin: Except that seems to be true.",
        "Ian: The hell it is, Kevin.",
        "Lucy: That is enough. Doc, you have got to listen to me. This is between\r\nthese two. You have to give them just some time to talk together.",
        "Kevin: So you think what they need is to talk?",
        "Lucy: Yes! At least give them a chance to talk. They cannot do that if you\r\nkeep sticking your nose into their business. Now, let\u2019s go outside and give\r\nthem some room, please.",
        "Kevin: No.",
        "Eve: Kevin --",
        "Lucy: Doc --",
        "Eve: I can handle this.",
        "Kevin: Are you sure?",
        "Ian: What do you think; she\u2019s in danger from her own husband?",
        "Kevin: I do now, yes.",
        "Eve: It\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll be fine, really. Please.",
        "Kevin: I\u2019ll be outside if you need me.\u00a0 Lucy, what are you thinking?",
        "Lucy: Do you want me to tell you what I\u2019m thinking? Honestly, what I\u2019m\r\nreally thinking?",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: Ok, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m thinking maybe Ian is absolutely right.",
        "Kevin: What?",
        "Lucy: Maybe you wanted Eve to leave him. You did, didn\u2019t you?",
        "************************************************",
        "Livvie: Maybe you're right. I needed to let go of Jack. He\u2019s probably\r\nbetter off without me.",
        "Caleb: Maybe you're better off, too.",
        "Livvie: I just feel so terrible for what I did to him.",
        "Caleb: Someone who truly loves you doesn\u2019t give up.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I betrayed him.",
        "Caleb: You betrayed me, too. Did I walk away? Have I given up on you for even\r\none moment?",
        "Livvie: No.",
        "Caleb: You tried to kill me, and still I\u2019m here, in love with you.",
        "Livvie: You've never stopped.",
        "Caleb: And I never will because what I feel for you is beyond boundaries.\r\nIt\u2019s beyond anything you ever could experience with Jack. Think about it.\r\nThink about a love that has no end and, no matter what happens, it\u2019s there for\r\nyou forever.",
        "Livvie: Forever.",
        "Caleb: I know that sometimes that\u2019s hard for you to comprehend. You've been\r\nhurt so many times. People have disappointed you -- your mother, Jack.",
        "Livvie: They all leave me.",
        "Caleb: But I won\u2019t. I will be there as long as you want me, as long as\r\nyou'll allow me to be. So, you see, the decision is yours, Olivia. You can be\r\nalone in the cold, harsh world of these people, or you can have love, starting\r\nright now, that will be everlasting.",
        "Livvie: I don\u2019t want to be alone. Caleb, I can\u2019t be alone.",
        "Caleb: You don\u2019t have to be, my love. Not anymore.",
        "************************************************",
        "Man: Ok, kid. You got it all figured out. You're going to make all these\r\nchanges. Tell me how you plan to break all the rules, huh?",
        "Rafe: Well, first off, I\u2019d just warn Lucy and all the others that Caleb\u2019s\r\nnot dead -- or undead, or whatever. But, you know, I\u2019d tell them that he\u2019s\r\non his way back.",
        "Man: Go on.",
        "Rafe: And then I\u2019d -- I\u2019d find a way to trap him, you know, and just end\r\nall this once and for all.",
        "Man: You'd kill him?",
        "Rafe: Yes. To protect these innocent people, yeah.",
        "Man: I think maybe it\u2019s revenge.",
        "Rafe: What?",
        "Man: Settling a score with this Caleb creep. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving you,\r\nisn\u2019t it, kid?",
        "Rafe: No, I just --",
        "Man: That\u2019s why you called him out sooner than you should have and gummed\r\nup the works.",
        "Rafe: I never meant to do that.",
        "Man: I don\u2019t care what you meant. He knows what you are. You blew the hell\r\nout of your own cover.",
        "Rafe: No, I can still fix things! You see, if it wasn\u2019t for these rules --",
        "Man: The rules are in place for a reason. They've been there since the\r\nbeginning of time. But you know better, right? You're not on the job two months;\r\nyou're going to show us all how it\u2019s done.",
        "Rafe: No. It\u2019s just that my friend -- these people are in so much pain.",
        "Man: Well, that\u2019s really tough, kid, because pain is part of life. People\r\ngrow stronger from pain. They learn from it. You got to let them make their own\r\ndecisions.",
        "Rafe: Fine, but what if they make the wrong ones? What if Caleb wins?",
        "Man: He might! He might. The battle between good and evil is as old as time.\r\nExcept we got something on our side -- our faith that the good in people\u2019s\r\nhearts will prevail. And therein lies your challenge, Rafe, my boy -- to remind\r\nthem of what\u2019s inside, in here, that counts. You think you can do that, kid?\r\nYou think you can set aside your hatred for Caleb and help make that happen?\r\nHuh?",
        "************************************************",
        "Kevin: Do you think I wanted this to happen? Do you think I wanted Eve to\r\nleave Ian and uproot their child like that?",
        "Lucy: I don\u2019t want to believe that, no. I do not want to believe that. But,\r\nfrankly, it\u2019s getting harder and harder not to.",
        "Kevin: You've asked me before if I have any feelings left for eve, and I told\r\nyou the answer is no.",
        "Lucy: Well, maybe the two of you don\u2019t even realize it. You know, who would\r\nhave thought she would have actually left Ian? But she did, and where does she\r\nshow up? She shows up at your door with her baby and all her bags, ready to move\r\nright in.",
        "Kevin: She\u2019s scared, Lucy. She didn\u2019t know where else to turn, and I am\r\nstill her friend.",
        "Lucy: You're also still her ex-husband, and that is a fact I\u2019m getting a\r\nreally hard time right now ignoring. I can\u2019t.",
        "Kevin: What are you talking about?",
        "Lucy: You. Doc, don\u2019t you see? You're obsessed with Ian\u2019s past. And the\r\none point that keeps coming up in all that is that you and Eve were happily\r\nmarried before the kidnapping.",
        "Kevin: Actually, we weren\u2019t.",
        "Lucy: Well, whatever. Don\u2019t you see? You're so possessed with her -- with\r\nher life, her problems, everything -- that I\u2019m beginning to feel like just\r\nsome sort of discarded consolation prize.",
        "Kevin: You know that isn\u2019t true.",
        "Lucy: Do I really?",
        "Kevin: Lucy, for the gazillionth time, I love you. We're engaged, for god\u2019s\r\nsake. I want to marry you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "Lucy: I -- I feel just a \"but\" coming here.",
        "Kevin: The only \"but\" is that I still care about eve, but only as a\r\nfriend. And to be honest with you, if she needs to stay here, I won\u2019t turn her\r\naway.",

        "Ian: How\u2019s it going? It\u2019s all right. But it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok. There\u2019s\r\nmy little boy. I know, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok.",
        "Eve: You really have a way with him.",
        "Ian: Because I love him. And I love you.",
        "[Daniel cries]",
        "Ian: But it\u2019s all right.",
        "Eve: Shh.",
        "Ian: And I know you're angry with me.",
        "[Daniel cries]",
        "Ian: Come here, it\u2019s ok. Come here. I should never have questioned your\r\ncapabilities of being a mother. Sorry about that. But how can you believe\r\nKevin\u2019s lies?",
        "Eve: I have never known Kevin to lie.",
        "Ian: He\u2019s convinced the woman I love, without any evidence, to believe the\r\nworst about me.",
        "Eve: Why would he do that?",
        "Ian: Because he hates me. He hates me for taking you away from him. But I can\r\nlive with that. What I can\u2019t live with is you believing horrible things about\r\nme.",
        "Eve: I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore.",
        "Ian: Believe in us. Look at us. Believe in us. I love you, and I\u2019ve loved\r\nyou from the moment I laid eyes on you. And I think you still care about me. So\r\nlet\u2019s -- let\u2019s not believe this stuff. Don\u2019t believe I would ever hurt\r\nyou. You know I wouldn\u2019t. We belong together. Look at us -- the three of us.\r\nLet\u2019s grab our stuff and go home as a family.",
        "[Daniel whimpers]",
        "Ian: I know it'll be all right.",

        "Livvie: I still don\u2019t understand how this is happening. I mean, you coming\r\nback.",
        "Caleb: When the time is right, you will understand everything.",
        "Livvie: But when will that be?",
        "Caleb: When I know I can trust you. And what you showed me today, that\r\nisn\u2019t far off. But for now all you need to know is that those people who tried\r\nto destroy me are getting what\u2019s coming to them. And when all this is said and\r\ndone, you and I are going to live happily ever after. You do want that, don\u2019t\r\nyou? Happily ever after?",
        "Livvie: It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.",
        "Caleb: Me, too. But there\u2019s still work to be done.",
        "Livvie: You're not going to hurt anyone?",
        "Caleb: Hurt anyone? No, my love. Not I.",
        "Ian: Come on, let\u2019s go.",
        "Eve: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: Everything ok here?",
        "Eve: Yes, I think it is.",
        "Kevin: What\u2019s going on?",
        "Eve: Well, Ian and I talked, and --",
        "Ian: And we're going home.",
        "Kevin: Eve?",
        "Eve: That\u2019s right. I realize that I overreacted.",
        "Kevin: Overreacted?",
        "Ian: She\u2019s made up her mind, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: I wasn\u2019t talking to you.",
        "Eve: I have, Kevin, and I appreciate everything that you've done.",
        "Kevin: Look, just do one thing. Just think about this for a while -- at least\r\na day.",
        "Ian: She doesn\u2019t have to think about it. She\u2019s going home where she\r\nbelongs.",
        "Eve: It\u2019s all right, Kevin. I\u2019ll call you if I need anything, ok?",
        "Ian: Let\u2019s go.",

        "Man: You just can\u2019t deny that you've got your own reasons for wanting to\r\nstop Caleb. I think I might have made a mistake. You're too green for this job.",
        "Rafe: No. No, no, no, I can handle it!",
        "Man: No, no, no, I\u2019m sorry, son. You talked me into giving you this gig\r\nagainst my better judgment, and it\u2019s not going to happen again.",
        "Rafe: So, what are you saying?",

        "Ian: I love you more than anything. Come on.\u00a0 What\u2019s wrong?",
        "Eve: Ian, I just remembered something. Earlier, when I was here in the loft,\r\nthat window over there just blew right open and this cold gust of air came in,\r\nand it blew little Danny\u2019s picture off the windowsill. It shattered it to\r\npieces. And then, out of the blue, the mobile started playing on its own.\r\nThat\u2019s why I freaked out. That\u2019s why I went to Kevin\u2019s house.",
        "Ian: It\u2019s ok. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m here now. I\u2019ll check it out, all right?\r\nLatch is broken, that\u2019s all.",
        "Eve: Ok, well, can you please fix it? It really needs to be fixed.",
        "Ian: Well, I can\u2019t fix it now. I\u2019d have to go to the hardware store.",
        "Eve: I don\u2019t want that window to not be locked.",
        "Ian: Ok. You going to be all right with me being gone?",
