", "Ian: So here I am back in town, I see nothing's changed. What's Livvie done now? ", "Frank: She lost the baby. ", "Ian: I'm sorry.

", "Lucy: Oh. Oh, I know what this is. I have been under an extreme amount of pressure lately and stress. I haven't been feeling very well or very happy, so I'm just sort of imagining something happy that might happen to me. So it's like I know logically Rafe has passed on to another dimension, he's gone to heaven, so I know that he can't possibly be walking toward me and he can't possibly -- it's a vision. It's a vision, that's all. Just a simple, pure vision. That's all it is. A vision that appears to be moving behind me. A vision that -- laughs at me. It's -- what -- you're here? ", "Rafe: I'm back for good this time. ", "Lucy: For sure, for sure, for sure? ", "Rafe: Yes. ", "Lucy: I mean, really? ", "Rafe: Yes. ", "Lucy: Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh. You're real. You are. You're back. ", "Rafe: Lucy -- ", "Lucy: Oh, my god! How? How? ", "Rafe: That's a long story. ", "Lucy: Ok, well, tell me. No, I mean, wait -- ", "Rafe: I -- ", "Lucy: But what about Alison? Where's she? ", "Rafe: Oh, she's, you know -- well, you know, we're getting married in a couple months. ", "Lucy: You're trying -- you're -- really? ", "Rafe: Yeah. ", "Lucy: Please tell me I\u2019m not dreaming this. I need some good news. Tell -- it's true? For sure? ", "Rafe: Yes, yes, it is. ", "Lucy: Oh! Oh! ", "Rafe: It's true, yes. ", "Lucy: Oh, this is so -- I've got something to celebrate for a change instead of everything so dark and awful. ", "Rafe: Ok, all right -- ", "Lucy: So you're happy and you're fine? ", "Rafe: Yeah, about that -- slow down. ", "Lucy: What? Yeah, what? ", "Rafe: I wish it were all good news. ", "Lucy: Oh, please don't do that. What? What is it? ", "Rafe: Alison just found out her father died. ", "Lucy: Oh, my god, that's horrible. How? ", "Rafe: In a boating accident. Actually, her mother came to town to tell her herself. ", "Lucy: Elizabeth came to Port Charles? ", "Rafe: You know her? ", "Lucy: Oh -- knew her, sort of. I mean, I knew of her because we sort of have in common that we came from the wrong side of the tracks and worked our way up, if you know what I mean. So did you actually meet her? ", "Rafe: Oh, yeah. ", "Lucy: Yeah? And how did that go? ", "Rafe: Well, let me just say that on my long trip back, the one thing I didn't lose is my instinct for trouble, and she is big-time trouble. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Amanda: Oh, darling, you know, it's so wonderful having tea like this with you. We should do it again. ", "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, we will. Um -- Nana, there's something I need to talk to you about. ", "Amanda: Well, of course, darling. You can tell me anything. What is it? ", "[Doorbell rings] ", "Alison: I -- let me -- let me just get that, ok, and get rid of whoever that is. Sorry. Mother, what are you doing here? ", "Elizabeth: I didn't think it was fair to make you deliver the news to Mother Barrington that her son is dead. ", "Alison: Oh, my God. ", "Alison: Nana? Nana, are you ok? I'm so sorry. Are you all right? ", "Amanda: Is it -- is it true? ", "Alison: Nana, listen to me, daddy's gone. I'm so sorry. ", "Elizabeth: I'm so sorry. ", "Alison: I'm so sorry. What the hell is the matter with you? ", "Elizabeth: I'm sorry. I -- ", "Alison: What, you're not going to be happy until you wipe us all out, is that it? ", "Alison: Nana, I called your doctor and he said that if you just take one of these, you're going to feel a lot better, ok? ", "Elizabeth: Is there anything that I can get for you, Amanda? ", "Amanda: My son is dead. ", "Alison: I know. I'm sorry. ", "Amanda: I haven't spoken to him for such a long time, and now gone. ", "Alison: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. ", "Amanda: Very typical of your mother, I'm afraid. ", "Elizabeth: I didn't know you were here, Mother Barrington. ", "Amanda: Oh, really? ", "Elizabeth: I just thought that we should get together. ", "Amanda: Is that why you're here, Elizabeth? To grieve over the loss of my son? ", "Elizabeth: He was my husband. ", "Amanda: Yes, the first in a long series of heartbreaks, I'm afraid. ", "Elizabeth: I'm very well aware that you never cared for me, Mother Barrington, but maybe we should get past that right now, just for the moment. ", "Amanda: I'll never get past that, Elizabeth. But I do want to know how my son died. ", "Elizabeth: It was a boating accident. ", "Amanda: And? ", "Elizabeth: Malcolm slipped overboard. ", "Amanda: And? ", "Elizabeth: We searched for him. ", "Amanda: Oh, yes, of course you did. You were so in love, weren't you? ", "Elizabeth: Alison's right, I should leave. You've -- it's been a very big day for you. We can continue this conversation some other time. ", "Alison: Oh, no, you don\u2019t. You insisted on barging in here, so I think that you should tell Nana everything -- and I mean everything. ", "Elizabeth: You can do it yourself, Alison. You know the rest. ", "Alison: Oh, no, see, I don't think that I do, but I\u2019m guessing that you know all the details of my father's death, so I want you to tell her everything -- and don't leave out the part about how you tried to save him. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Lucy: Do you want to tell me what it is about this Elizabeth that has you so riled up like this? ", "Rafe: You mean besides the fact that she treated Alison like an afterthought for her entire life? ", "Lucy: Well, yeah, there's that. I'll give you that, but there's something else going on here, cousin. What is it? ", "Rafe: Like I said, just an instinct. ", "Lucy: Yeah. Well, you know, I happen to have a certain understanding of people like Elizabeth because, well, let's just say I could've sort of been like her. What's that old-fashioned term? I think it's \"gold digger.\" ", "Rafe: Yeah, but you never walked out on a child of your own. Do you know years would go by and Alison wouldn't see either one of them? ", "Lucy: I know. That's bad. I think it's because Elizabeth used to walk around trying to tell everybody -- anybody that would listen -- that she wanted to bag a rich husband. ", "Rafe: Ok, ok, so she traded her daughter for time alone with her husband and his platinum card? What is that? ", "Lucy: I think what it was is that's the only way she thought she could be a Barrington. If she had his child, then maybe that would give her a permanent residence in the Barrington dynasty, the only way she could keep it. ", "Rafe: Right, till death do them part. ", "Lucy: Yes. But you have to understand that did doom Elizabeth to this unhappy, loveless, icky marriage. ", "Rafe: Mm-hmm, and she let her child grow up by herself. The thing is Alison\u2019s not dealing with this well. I mean, she says she doesn't feel anything, but it's like someone took her whole lonely childhood and just threw it up in her face. ", "Lucy: Ok. Ok. Well, you know me, the half-full-glass thing -- maybe there's something good that can come out of this. ", "Rafe: Oh. How do you figure? ", "Lucy: Ok, well, think about it. This woman loses her husband. He -- Malcolm dies in a boating accident. What's the first thing Elizabeth does? She comes back to Port Charles to see her daughter. Maybe -- maybe they'll somehow get close through this. ", "Rafe: Yeah, nice try, but I have a feeling that Alison\u2019s mother has another agenda for being back here. ", "Lucy: Ok, what is that based on? ", "Rafe: It's based on -- I don't know, when Alison and I were on our way out of town, I just started to get this weird vibe, and I can't explain it, but I just felt like we needed to be back here. ", "Lucy: Wait. Oh, cousin, I got to tell you this -- I had the same feeling. I was in Canada -- with Kevin. I need to tell you all about that. It's not good. But I had that same feeling that I had to get home, I had to get back to town because something was about to change in Port Charles again. What do you think that means? ", "Rafe: I don't know, it could be a family thing. ", "Lucy: Are you telling me you think this has something to do with the family business? ", "Rafe: It's a possibility. ", "Lucy: Are you saying you think that maybe Elizabeth is a vampire? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Ian: So what -- so you're saying that the Avatar was the father of Livvie\u2019s baby? ", "Frank: No one was supposed to know, but I guess it doesn't matter now. ", "Ian: Of course it matters. It matters to you. You weren't really in control at that point. ", "Frank: See, that's what I\u2019m talking about. Things happened here that don't happen anywhere else -- strange, inexplicable things with human consequences. ", "Ian: Yeah. Lucy believes that Port Charles exists in some kind of a -- a spiritual vortex where evil and good fight each other. ", "Frank: That makes sense to me. ", "Ian: Yeah. So what's the battle now, Frank? What are we looking for? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Jamal: Mmm. ", "Ricky: Yeah, thank you. Thank you. ", "Marissa: So, you're the Stephen Clay Experience? ", "Woman: Uh-huh. That's Mick, that's Cass. And I'm Reese. ", "Jamal: Oh, oh. Hmm. ", "Reese: We liked your sister song. ", "Marissa: Thanks. ", "Reese: You're the bloke that wrote the music? ", "Ricky: Yeah, that's me. ", "Reese: Cute. ", "Jamal: Yo, man, what you doing? ", "Reese: Mick's got low blood sugar. If he doesn't eat every hour, he turns into a wolf. ", "Jamal: And? ", "Reese: It's a medical condition. ", "Jamal: Yo, dude! You better back up. ", "Marissa: Uh, yeah, so, where -- where's Stephen Clay? ", "Ricky: Yeah, where's Stephen? He's supposed to be here by now. ", "Reese: Well, he sent us out to check you out. ", "Jamal: Which basically means he isn't going to show. ", "Marissa: Ok, check us out for what? ", "Reese: Nobody just meets Stephen. ", "Mick: Yeah. ", "Marissa: Uh -- no, that's not what he told me on the phone. He said he was going to be here. ", "Reese: Well, I guess you just didn't hear right. ", "Mick: So, how did this sister of yours die, babe? ", "Marissa: What? ", "Mick: How'd she check out? ", "Jamal: Uh, look, party's over, ok? You and your little freak show need to step on out of here, ok, right now. ", "Ricky: Hey, calm down. He gets a little worked up -- ", "Jamal: No, don't -- don't worry about me. ", "Ricky: About people touching his food. ", "Mick: You don't like us? ", "Jamal: Ok, I'm sorry. What I meant to say is step off and get out. ", "Mick: Ooh. ", "Jamal: Get out, dude. Bounce, leave. ", "Mick: We got a little bad-ass here, Reese! ", "[Cass laughs] ", "Reese: Mick doesn't like bad-asses. He eats them for lunch. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Elizabeth: Just what are you suggesting, Alison? ", "Alison: Well, it's a simple question. Did you try and save my father? ", "Elizabeth: Well, if you mean did I dive into the Aegean sea myself, the answer is no. ", "Amanda: Are you trying to say that my son might still be alive? ", "Elizabeth: We conducted an exhaustive search for his body. I personally did not see him go overboard, but we did everything that we could to save him. ", "Amanda: Well, it doesn't matter now. ", "Elizabeth: Mother Barrington, there is something that I do need to tell you. I'm not sure if it's going to help or hurt, but i do feel the need to tell you -- we were on our way home. ", "Amanda: To Port Charles? ", "Elizabeth: Malcolm felt so badly about the estrangement that he had established between you. ", "Amanda: My son was coming home? ", "Elizabeth: He was so proud of all of your charity and foundation work. As a matter of fact, he was in the process of establishing a European chapter of the Barrington foundation to parallel all of the nice works that you do here in Port Charles. ", "Amanda: Indeed. ", "Elizabeth: You can check it out yourself, Mother Barrington. I don't expect you to believe me. Your son loved you very much. It was just very difficult for him to show it -- that's all. ", "Amanda: Terence, will you take me home, please? ", "Alison: Nana, won't you stay with me? ", "Amanda: No, thank you, darling. There are so many things I have to do. I have to make the arrangements for the memorial service. ", "Alison: No, don't do that today. Please? Please? ", "Amanda: I love you, darling. And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for all of us. We'll talk later. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Thanks, Nana. ", "Alison: Was anything you just said true? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Lucy: Do you actually believe Elizabeth could be a vampire? ", "Rafe: Mm-hmm. ", "Lucy: What? ", "Rafe: Not the kind you're talking about. ", "Lucy: What other kind is there? ", "Rafe: Well, you see, Elizabeth is a human vampire, the kind that sucks the life out of everyone she comes in contact with, and I refuse to let Alison be one of them. ", "Lucy: All right. I'm in. What do you want me to do -- anything? ", "Rafe: No, no, you've been a great friend to Alison, so -- so just keep doing it, ok? ", "Lucy: Well, I will. Of course I will -- you know that -- but I have a feeling that Alison has everything she wants sitting right beside me here. She's not going to need me. All right, enough of that. Just -- just for the moment, I desperately need to know -- how did this happen? How did you come back to me? How -- what -- how did you get back here? What? Tell me. ", "Rafe: Ok. ", "Lucy: Ok. ", "Rafe: Forget about all that stuff. ", "Lucy: Yeah. ", "Rafe: Where do you want me to start? ", "Lucy: Um -- the beginning. ", "Rafe: You sure? ", "Lucy: Ok. Yes.

Right, and you -- you double-checked all that? Mm-hmm. Ok, thank you. ", "Lucy: What? What is it? What's happened? What is that? ", "Rafe: Lucy, it was good to see you. ", "Lucy: It's good to see you. Wait, wait, what are you doing? ", "Rafe: Story's going to have to wait. I have to get to Alison, ok? ", "Lucy: What? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************************************", "Jamal: So what do you want to do? You want to be natty dred, huh?

That's my man and I got his back, all right? ", "Reese: Too bad because I like you. Let the games begin. ", "Marissa: Ok, no, no, no, no! Ok, stop, all right? Stop it, ok? I'm tired of you two -- ", "Reese: What are you going to do, little girl? Take your song and go home? ", "Marissa: You got a problem with that? ", "Man: I certainly do.
