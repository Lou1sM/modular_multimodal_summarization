You have to try and explain it to me. Comeon, what happened?", "Jack: Lucy, being with her is hurting her more than it's helping her.", "Lucy: Ok, that's not exactly answering the question. Come on, Jack, you loveher and she loves you very much. Or is that it? Something's changed? Somebody'scome between you, someone else?", "Jack: Yes, there's somebody else -- Caleb Morley. He may be dead, but shehasn't been the same since that night on the roof.", "Lucy: You know what? None of us have really. I mean, think about me and Docnow, and now you and Livvie, and Eve and Ian. It's almost like Caleb wasn't theonly one who got struck by lightning. You know, we're all acting different. It'slike that movie \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" you know, wheneverybody stops acting like themselves and now we're all at each others'throats.", "Jack: Yeah, we were more together when we were fighting Caleb.", "Lucy: Yes, exactly. We were united, standing together, and now it's likewe're trying to destroy ourselves. You know what? If I didn't have peopletelling me I should know better, I would think Caleb set some sort of curse onus from wherever he is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "***************************************************", "Eve: You are a coward and a liar sneaking around, telling lies about myhusband.", "Anne-Marie: I've been sneaking around because I'm scared to death of Ian.

He's a good man.", "Anne-Marie: I thought so, too. He has a way with words, so charming in thatgruff way of his, so ready to tell you everything you want to hear.", "Eve: I don't want to hear any of this.", "Anne-Marie: I was married. Just like you were. Trying to work things out,just like you were. But Ian manipulated everything so I wouldn't have a chance.Once he got me alone, he worked his powers.", "Eve: If you don't leave right now, I\u2019m going to call the police.", "Anne-Marie: He told me he wanted me not just for one night but for always.", "Eve: What did he say to you?", "Anne-Marie: That he wanted me not just for one night but for always. Did hesay that to you, as well? I'm not saying that he doesn't love you, Eve. I thinkIan believes everything he says and does in the moment. There's been others,too.", "Eve: Others?", "Anne-Marie: I know Ian. I've kept tabs on him ever since he did this to me.It's the same pattern. Everybody has theirs, Eve, but his are dangerous. I knoweverything may seem fine now. He says and does all the right things. But theminute you question him too strongly or don't live up to the woman he expectsyou to be, his love can be lethal.", "Eve: I don't want to hear any of this.", "Anne-Marie: I know you don't. But I wish that someone had been there to tellme. Get away while you still have the chance. Protect yourself and your baby.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Elevator bell dings]", "Anne Marie: Oh, God, he's back. He'll kill me if he sees me.

Did -- did Kevincall?", "Eve: No. No, I'm just tired from everything.", "Ian: Yeah, we all are. But I'm glad you're here so we can work this out.Couldn't live my life without you.", "Eve: That reminds me of something. Do you remember that first night in thecabin when you told me you wanted me not just for one night but for always?", "Ian: Of course.", "Eve: That was it, you know -- the moment when I knew I was in love.", "Ian: The line works every time. I was kidding. Just joking.", "Eve: I know. That's not what I was thinking.", "Ian: Ok, what were you thinking?", "Eve: We both said some pretty unpleasant things to each other today, and Ithink it would be best if we took some time to cool down.", "Ian: What? The night someplace else tonight.\u00a0 You did talk to Kevin, didn't you? Where is all this coming from? Ithought we were going to work this out together.", "Eve: I'm just confused!", "Ian: Ok, then let's talk about it,\u00a0 let's -- let's get past this,please.", "Eve: I want to be alone with the baby.", "Ian: Where is this coming from?

I'm sorry, but, Frank, forget what I saidearlier, ok? I don't think there's going to be any problem.", "Alison: I can't believe that you just threatened to go after my boyfriend.", "Valerie: I'm just telling you how things are going to be.", "Alison: And what makes you think that I won't tell Jamal what you said.", "Valerie: I'll deny it; say that you took something the wrong way. You'll looklike the jealous, insecure girlfriend, and you know how much guys love that.", "Alison: You know, Valerie, I don't really know what you're trying to provehere, but if you stick around, it's going to be a lot harder on you than it ison me.", "Valerie: Oh, really?", "Alison: Really. See, Jamal and I are in love. We're very happy. So if you'dlike, you can just stick around and see that every day. That's just no problem.I mean, be my guest. I'd be happy to rub your face in it.", "Jamal: Hey, ladies.

You know, Lucy, there's a part of me that wishesyou were right because then I have something to blame for Livvie and I growingapart.", "Lucy: But maybe -- you know, maybe there is a force that is pulling youapart.", "Jack: Lucy, the force of what we've been through. And I hate to say this, butmaybe we changed too much from this whole thing. I mean, I was a vampire.\u00a0 Livvie married a vampire. It's a horror story that we both lived through together, and maybe that's it. Maybe we remind each of something we're trying to forget.\u00a0", "Lucy: Ok, maybe. Maybe you're right.\u00a0", "Jack: Yeah.\u00a0", "Lucy: Oh, I can't shake this feeling that there is something out there, something big that is working against all of us.\u00a0", "Jack: I don't know, I don't know. I just know that standing here drinking is not going to fix anything for me. Here. Drinks are on me. Would you like me to call you a cab? I'm going to go call a cab for myself.\u00a0", "Lucy: No. No, no, no, no, no. Actually, you know what I'm going to do? I think I'm going to stay right here and get a room in the hotel.\u00a0", "Jack: Why is that?\u00a0", "Lucy: I don't want to go home. I hate big, empty, lonely houses and I don't want to take the chance there's a bunch of messages waiting on my machine fromDoc and I don't want really to take the chance of him stopping by.\u00a0", "Jack: Not ready to talk?\u00a0", "Lucy: No, I'm not ready to talk at all.

Could go take a bath. I could order room service and eat myself silly. I could maybeeat all those peanuts. Boy, this being alone stinks. Hey, I have a very, very, very important question for you. You aren't closing right now, are you?\u00a0", "Bartender: No. You can stay as long as you like.\u00a0", "Lucy: Good. Then I want another one of these, and then maybe another one -- maybe, you know. Thanks.\u00a0", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "***************************************************", "Ian: No, you're not going to take my son and start running again. What's going on here?

So, what did I miss?\u00a0", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "***************************************************", "Karen: Well, if you think tonight is going to blow your mind, wait until I tell you about the tripI have planned for us.\u00a0", "Frank: Trip?\u00a0", "Karen: Just get a few days off. It'll be worth it.\u00a0", "Frank: Do I get a preview?\u00a0", "Karen: Well, the place doesn't matter. Just imagine making love all day and all night.\u00a0", "Frank: Hmm, I think I can do that.\u00a0", "Karen: Hmm, and I'm feeling like I could do anything, Frank. I want us to try everything, whatever comes to mind. I don't want to waste a single minute, starting by telling you how muchI love you. I love you, Frank Scanlon!\u00a0", "Jamal: All right, Frank!\u00a0", "Valerie: Yeah!\u00a0", "Jamal: Frank, my man!\u00a0", "Man: Get on the floor! Get on the floor! Everybody get on the floor!

You went home with your wiff -- wife, Eve. I saw you go.\u00a0", "Ian: Yeah, apparently, she didn't want me there. What's your excuse?\u00a0", "Lucy: I have none except I don't want to be with Doc tonight.\u00a0", "Ian: Can't say I blame you.\u00a0", "Lucy: This is sad. Look at the two of us, staying in a hotel when we're supposed to be with the people that love us. It's really not right. What is wrong with this picture?\u00a0", "Ian: I don't know. Lonely and pathetic, right?\u00a0", "Lucy: Lonely and pathetic. No, no, I don't like those words. Don't ever say them again. I don't -- can you -- do you want maybe a little company or something?\u00a0", "Ian: Sure. Why not? A man shouldn't drink alone, right?\u00a0", "Lucy: Oh, no, no, a woman. You know, I always say a woman. Not a man, but a woman.\u00a0", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "***************************************************", "Jack: Oh, oh, oh. I'm so sorry.
