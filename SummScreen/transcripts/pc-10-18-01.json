I mean, I picked her scarfup, and -- and then I saw you.", "Livvie: No. I guess she just ran past.", "Jack: Right, right. So, how are you?", "Livvie: Fine. I was just coming to see Alison. You?", "Jack: Actually, I was just headed home.", "Livvie: All right. So we'd better get in there, then, huh?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Thank god you're here.", "Kevin: Are you all right?", "Eve: Barely. I told Ian to leave.", "Kevin: But I -- I thought you --", "Eve: Anne-Marie came by here to see me.", "Kevin: What did she tell you?", "Eve: She told me personal things that Ian told me. And she told me that I wasjust another woman in a long line of other women. God, Kevin, I want to believein him so much, but then something happens that makes me doubt him all overagain.", "Kevin: I'm amazed she came here at all, she\u2019s so afraid that Ian will findout that she\u2019s still alive.", "Eve: She told me that she was worried about what he would do to me.", "Kevin: Something\u2019s not right here. Ok, I want you to tell me everything shesaid.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: Thank you very, very much.", "Ian: It\u2019s bad enough to have Kevin believing I'm a kidnapper. Now evebelieves him as well.", "Lucy: I know. I'm sorry about that. I tried to reason with doc. I did, Iswear. But he thinks I'm completely, totally crazy, that I'm the one actingcrazy. But, Ian Thornhart, I swear to you as sure as I'm standing, I thinksomething else is going on out there, something not really of this world. And Iwould bet my chakras on it that there\u2019s something out there that\u2019s trying todestroy all of us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Man: Everybody stay calm! Nice and easy!", "Jamal: Whatever you do, just stay behind me, ok?", "Man: You -- open the safe and give me all your cash!", "Frank: Now, look. This is my family\u2019s restaurant. Why don\u2019t you leteveryone go? I'll give you what we got. Now, what\u2019s your name?", "Man: The next hero is a dead hero! Get in here! Get in here!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "\u00a0", "", "", "Gabriela: You bastard!", "Chris: What? Oh! What\u2019s the matter with you?", "Gabriela: I have been working so hard to get my life back, and you -- you goto the retreat pretending to be my doctor, asking all kinds of personalquestions about my mental health?", "Chris: Gabby, you were infected by a vampire, and your behavior\u2019s neverreturned to normal. Excuse me for being concerned.", "Gabriela: You liar! You just want to use me for more research. Well, you knowwhat, Chris? I'm going to go to the chief of staff. I'm going to tell AlanQuartermaine everything I know about you!", "Chris: Fine, I lied. Is that what you want to hear? I lied. But it wasbecause I was more than just concerned about you. It was -- it was -- look, thisis embarrassing, but ever since you were bitten by Caleb, I haven\u2019t been ableto stop thinking about you, dreaming about you. You are the most sensual woman Ihave ever seen in my life.", "Gabriela: Oh, shut up!", "Chris: Gabby --", "Gabriela: God.", "Chris: Look, it was easier just to lie to you. Don\u2019t you understand? Whatam I going to tell you, that someone else was, you know, accidentally injectedwith vampire blood and I wanted to see how you were doing so we could, like,compare the two? Come on.", "Gabriela: I never would've believed that.", "Chris: Of course not.", "Gabriela: All right, so now what? Now what do I do with you?", "Chris: Just try and understand. That\u2019s all I can ask.", "Gabriela: Yeah, well, no more checking up on me. Yeah, right. Maybe youshould seek some professional help.", "Chris: Maybe you're right.", "Chris: Oh, Ramsey, you're good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: So, after Ian left, I turn around and there she is. I would have thrownher out, but she started telling me these personal things, using the exact wordsthat Ian used with me.", "Kevin: Like?", "Eve: Like he wanted her not just for one night but for always.", "Kevin: So he handed her a line.", "Eve: No. No, not just any line. The line. The exact line. The exact wordsthat Ian said to me. How would she know that if it wasn\u2019t true? My god, hemust have used that line a million times with other women, and I fell for itjust like she did.", "Kevin: Or Anne-Marie isn\u2019t the helpless victim she makes herself out to be.", "Eve: What do you mean?", "Kevin: Well, think about it. She pops up here again, just when you and Ianare working things out? I mean, the timing\u2019s perfect. And she never saidanything to me about other women.", "Eve: She didn\u2019t?", "Kevin: No. It just seems that she changes her story to suit her purpose.", "Eve: So, what are you saying? Do you think that this could be some sort ofset-up?", "Kevin: Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m a lot less sure of Ian\u2019s guilt than I was alittle while ago.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: So this is something in the stars, is it?", "Lucy: No. Actually, I think it\u2019s much lower. I think we're talking hellfireand damnation.", "Ian: What, we have an evil force attacking us?", "Lucy: Just bear with me for a minute. You know how we all saw Caleb bite thedust, right?", "Ian: Ah --", "Lucy: No, just listen. I really believe that that big rat\u2019s out there --oh!", "Ian: Ooh.", "Lucy: Oh, my goodness --", "Ian: I'm -- I\u2019m sorry.", "Lucy: Wait -- aha! See? See?", "Ian: No, no, no. That\u2019s no evil force. Just me being clumsy and half in thebag. I'm sorry.", "Lucy: That\u2019s ok. I guess I am being a little paranoid. I am soaking wethere. Do you have something I could change into, maybe, out of this dress?", "Ian: I'm traveling light, but there might be a robe in the --", "Lucy: Oh, yeah.", "Ian: Thing.", "Lucy: Good idea. Ooh. Yikes. What else can go wrong tonight?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: Ok, ok. When I make a move, duck under the table where it\u2019s safe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: Jack, this guy can kill you. You don\u2019t have the same strength asbefore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Ok, I'll give you the money, but no one else needs to get hurt, ok?", "Man: This is all you got?", "[Glass breaks]", "Man: You are jacking with me, man! You better come up with some cash, orI\u2019m going to take somebody out!", "Frank: All right, just calm down, man! Calm down.", "Karen: Ok. That\u2019s enough. You're disturbing our diners, so please leavenow.", "Man: Get the hell back, lady.", "Karen: I'm a doctor. I can give you all the drugs you want. Deal?", "Frank: Karen, please, get back!", "Karen: He won\u2019t hurt me -- not when I could give him everything he needs.So, what\u2019s your pleasure? Painkillers? Morphine?", "Man: I'll shoot!", "Karen: You can\u2019t hurt me. Nothing can hurt me now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: How does she know so much about Ian\u2019s past, especially the personalthings that he said to me?", "Kevin: I don\u2019t know.", "Eve: Once you start doubting someone, Kevin, you can\u2019t stop. Every time Iturn around, something else happens that makes me suspicious. I'm afraid of myown husband.", "Kevin: Let\u2019s try and stick to what we know. I love Lucy, and I know youlove Ian.", "Eve: I do. I do love Ian. But I don\u2019t know what to make of this Anne-Mariebusiness. And I have a child to protect now.", "Kevin: I think it\u2019s time we all start talking to each other and starttrying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. I'll go to Ian. I'll comparenotes with him, and we'll get to the bottom of this.", "Eve: I just -- I just want to know the truth, ok?", "Whatever that is.", "Kevin: You'll be all right here alone for a while?", "Eve: Yeah. Oh, what would I do without you, Kevin?", "Kevin: Well, you're never going to have to find out.", "Kevin: And I really do hope I\u2019m wrong about Ian.", "Eve: So do I.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Sorry again for spilling my drink on you.", "Lucy: That\u2019s ok. I'm fine.", "Ian: Room service? Yes, hello. I need some more booze up here. Irish whiskey.I don\u2019t know. Hang on.", "Ian: 534. Yeah, cheers. Thanks.", "Lucy: Ok. The more and more I ponder this and study this; I'm convincedit\u2019s not just some nameless evil after us. It\u2019s got to be Caleb.", "Ian: No, no, no. Caleb was turned into a million particles, hit by lightning.Do you remember that?", "Lucy: I do. But what if he really wasn\u2019t?", "[Ian sighs]", "Lucy: Come on. We're not sure what destroys a vampire. We don\u2019t know ifthey really ever die. It\u2019s not like we're reading some book here, followingthe lead. We don\u2019t know.", "Ian: And, what, that coming from a vampire slayer?", "Lucy: You know what? I just happen to be very new at this whole calling outevil thing. But I do know somebody who might be able to help us -- my cousinRafe. He\u2019s an expert. He has all these powers, and maybe we could just callhim and ask him, \"is there a way that Caleb could --\"", "Ian: Perfect. Mm-hmm.", "Lucy: You don\u2019t know! He could know.", "Ian: Sure. Yeah, give him a call; tell him to join the party. We got morebooze coming.", "Lucy: Ok, fine, I -- will. Actually, maybe I won\u2019t. You see, remember thatnight in the woods when we were holding hands and doing the chanting and I triedto summon evil and it didn\u2019t exactly swoop down on us? Well, that\u2019s becauseRafe sort of stopped it from swooping.", "Ian: Then what\u2019s the point of being a vampire slayer?", "Lucy: My cousin is very protective of me. And he actually showed me a visionof my death, Ian. And it wasn\u2019t a very pretty sight.", "Ian: Vision of death, is it? I'm going to keep drinking.", "Lucy: Oh -- ok. All right. Me, too. Wait. I'll get it. Listen -- Rafe hasthese amazing powers, and you know what? He really did show me a vision of mydeath, which means that he can see into the future, which means he does havethese amazing powers -- and that death part was really scary.", "Ian: Ok. I can\u2019t believe I'm going to ask you this. Who killed you?", "Lucy: Well, that\u2019s the part I\u2019m not really very clear on. But what if --just what if it actually was Caleb?", "Ian: Enough with the Caleb stuff. Let it go. Please. It\u2019s over.", "Lucy: I can\u2019t do that, see. I really can\u2019t. Because if I do, I\u2019m afraidsome big blob of evil is going to descend upon all of us and destroy us -- youand me and eve and Kevin and --", "Ian: Lucy -- you can\u2019t put the world on your shoulders. I've tried it, andit doesn\u2019t work.", "Lucy: I have to. I have no choice -- you know, it seems to me I\u2019m the onlyone that actually believes that Caleb is the one behind messing up all ourlives. Don\u2019t you see, if I do not find out what is destroying all of us andget rid of it, then we are all completely, totally doomed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Man: Back off, lady. I swear I will shoot you.", "Karen: You could try, but you can\u2019t hurt me. So put the gun down.", "Man: I'm warning you.", "Frank: Karen, what were you doing? That guy could have killed you.", "Karen: It worked, didn\u2019t it? I stopped him.", "Frank: Oh, my god. If anything would have happened to you -- look, you'rehurt. You're bleeding.", "Karen: That\u2019s strange. I don\u2019t feel any pain.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Andy: Police!", "Frank: Hey, it\u2019s under control.", "Andy: Yeah, we got a call there was a robbery in progress. Medical help\u2019son the way.", "Frank: That jerk right there -- he\u2019s all yours.", "Andy: Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: God, are you ok? Are you hurt badly?", "Jamal: No, no, I just got a bump on my hard head. I'm fine.", "Alison: Well, I should probably go get you --", "Valerie: Some ice.", "Alison: Or something.", "Jamal: Yeah.", "Alison: Wow -- the robber must have gotten in through the back. Somebody musthave left the door open.", "Valerie: What, are you suggesting it was me?", "Alison: Well, I didn\u2019t say that, Valerie.", "Jamal: Look, why don\u2019t you two just chill, ok? The guy\u2019s a druggie. Hewould have found some way in.", "Andy: Mind if I ask you some questions about what you witnessed?", "Jamal: No. Sure.", "Valerie: Only Jamal needs to take it easy, you know. He got hurt.", "Alison: Thanks, val. Think we got it from here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Officer: Let\u2019s go, punk. You have the right to remain silent. Anything yousay can and may be used against you in a court of law.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris: I heard about the trouble on the police scanner. Everybody ok?", "Valerie: Yeah -- over here. He got his head hit. Is it serious?", "Chris: Let me take a look. No, it just looks like a nasty bump. Keep the iceon it, ok?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Yeah. Good thing I got a hard head, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Hey, Ramsey, over here. The lowlife broke some glass. Karen got a cut.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Karen: It\u2019s nothing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris: Just going to need a couple of stitches. Good thing you caught theguy, huh? Stealing is such a horrible crime, isn\u2019t it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Are you guys ok? Huh?", "Jack: Yeah.", "Alison: Yeah? What? Oh, my god. She is all over him. She\u2019s driving mecrazy.", "Livvie: Yeah, I'd be upset, too, if some woman who slept with the man I lovedshowed up on my door. And then I find out there\u2019s a baby involved?", "Alison: No -- no, no, no, no. Jamal has nothing to do with that.", "Livvie: How could you be so sure, Alison? I mean, Valerie and Jamal seempretty tight to me.", "Alison: Livvie, why would you even suggest something like that?", "Livvie: I don\u2019t know. I just think it\u2019s pretty weird that she shows up inport Charles after all this time, that\u2019s all.", "Alison: Jamal said that she had received a letter about the retreat here.", "Livvie: Yeah, well, maybe she\u2019s lying. I mean, come on, Alison. You'reright. Look at them.", "Alison: Yeah, every chance she gets.", "Jack: Ok, guys, come on. All right? Doesn\u2019t mean Jamal has anything to dowith the baby.", "Livvie: Yeah, maybe not. But wouldn\u2019t you want to know the truth, Alison?Even if the baby is Jamal\u2019s, your love was meant to be. It'll go on forever.You can get through anything. Right, Jack?", "Jack: Livvie, stop. All right, what\u2019s gotten into you?", "Livvie: You'll forgive Jamal, Alison, even if Jack can\u2019t forgive me, evenif Jack doesn\u2019t love me enough.", "Jack: Livvie, I said stop.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "This is the way", "we wash our face", "Eve: Oh.", "[Daniel cries]", "Eve: Shh.

We've got each other. Yes, we do. Butdaddy\u2019s all alone tonight.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: You know, doc -- we -- me and doc and I -- all of us -- the two of ushave been through so much. You know, we conquered every minefield, everyobstacle, and now this.", "Ian: Well, just think of it as a bump in the road.", "Lucy: \"A bump in the road\"? This is more like a huge, giganticcrater, and it\u2019s all because he just has this soft spot when it comes toprotecting eve and -- no offense.", "Ian: Don\u2019t have to convince me.", "Lucy: Is it possible, do you think -- is it possible that you can completelydivorce your soul mate? You know, just cut it off. Or maybe, better yet, what ifyou could just bop him on the head, you know? I'm so mad right now, I feel likethat\u2019s what I could do is just bop him and -- he just doesn\u2019t get it, doeshe?", "Ian: No. I can\u2019t seem to get through to eve, either.", "Lucy: Look at the two of us.

Oh, my god.", "Karen: The wound healed itself. It\u2019s like my hand was never cut.", "Chris: Better keep this between us, ok?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: Livvie, why are you trying to stir up problems between Alison andJamal? And why'd you say that about Valerie\u2019s baby?", "Livvie: I don\u2019t know. Jack, it just -- it just kind of came out. I don\u2019tknow.", "Jack: You never know what you're doing anymore, do you?", "Alison: Livvie --", "Jack: Just forget it. Forget it, all right?", "Alison: No, wait --", "Jack: Look --", "Alison: Jack, what if Livvie\u2019s right? What if the math adds up?", "Jack: Don\u2019t listen to Livvie, Alison.
