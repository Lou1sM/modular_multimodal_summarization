        "Jamal: Ok, that's \u2013 ",
        "Marissa: No, no, no, listen. It's like I understood every beat, every single amazing note. It was like I knew exactly -- I knew exactly what he was trying to say, and so I just started putting it into words and then that's what all of this is. ",

        "Joshua: In the meantime, Marissa \u2013 ",
        "Marissa: Oh \u2013 ",
        "Joshua: Why don't you give that to me, and I'll give it to Stephen. ",
        "Marissa: No, it's ok. You know what, I got to do some polishing on the lyrics, so, you know, I'll just hold on to it and then you could do whatever you want with it later. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, let's go. Ready to go? ",

        "Jamal: I don't know. ",
        "Marissa: Simple, honey. You hide behind another identity, like your manager. Oh, my gosh, you guys \u2013 ",
        "Jamal: Oh, so you think Joshua is Stephen Clay? You think they're the same person? ",
        "Marissa: Yes, yes, yes! Think about it -- it all fits, right? Joshua is the one who led me here. Joshua is the one who saw what I was eating at the restaurant. And guess what -- he had the stuff waiting for me here. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ",
        "Marissa: Right. See? ",

        "Marissa: No, Ricky, you saw how badly he wanted my lyrics. ",
        "Ricky: That doesn't mean he's Stephen Clay. ",

        "Marissa: Honey, the man is a genius. ",
        "Jamal: The man is a control freak. ",
        "Marissa: Maybe. But I understand him. I understand why he needs to hide his real identity, why he needs to be this mystery man. ",

        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait. How did she seem to you? Did she seem a little strange, kind of different? ",
        "Ian: Different how? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I don't know. At first i thought she was having some sort of nervous breakdown because of losing the baby, but now \u2013 ",
        "Ian: No, she's just a very sick girl, that's all. ",
        "Lucy: You didn't pick up a strange vibe? I got the most \u2013 ",
        "Ian: A vibe? You have one of your feelings again? All right, let's -- we'll talk about \u2013 ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no. She seemed different, like, sweet and unlike Livvie. ",
        "Ian: Listen to me. Listen \u2013 ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Ian: Listen. Sit down. ",
        "Lucy: Well, why? ",
        "Ian: I'm going to go fix Livvie, all right? You do me a favor -- stay here, don't play with your crystals or your cards. No investigating this. Stay here, please. I don't want to have to worry about the both of you. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I won't budge. I promise. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Ian: And when it's done, I'll come back and I\u2019ll try and find you, all right? ",
        "Lucy: Please do. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Oh. I don't care what you say. I'm getting a spooky little feeling running up and down my spine. What is that about? That strange music and Livvie\u2019s personality change -- something is not right. I can feel it. ",
