        "Karen: Chris -- ",
        "Chris: We need to run some tests, Karen. ",
        "Karen: No, thanks. ",
        "Chris: You gashed your hand wide open. ",
        "Karen: Hours ago. So? ",
        "Chris: Now it's completely healed. Don't you \r\nwant to know what's going on inside your body? ",
        "Karen: I already know, Chris. You shot me full \r\nof vampire serum. And I love it. So what else is \r\nthere? ",
        "Chris: Ok, look, Wexler, I am through playing \r\ngames with you. Now either you come with me right \r\nnow and we run the tests that I want to run, or I'm going to find frank and I'm going to tell him \r\nwhat's happening to the woman he's sharing his bed \r\nwith.  ",
        "The excitement. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? What happened? ",
        "Frank: Attempted robbery. ",
        "Ian: Is everyone all right? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, yeah, I guess, but what are you \r\ndoing here at this time of night? ",
        "Ian: You -- you know about computers, don't \r\nyou? ",
        "Frank: Well, yeah. I'm no expert, but I know my \r\nway around a keyboard. ",
        "Ian: Well, that's good enough. ",
        "Frank: For what? ",
        "Ian: I need your help, frank. Everything's \r\nfallen apart -- my life, my -- I'm losing my wife, \r\nmy kid. I need your help. ",
        "Rafe: Dr. Collins? ",
        "Kevin: Rafe. How did -- how did you -- where -- \r\nnever mind. ",
        "Rafe: Good idea. You got a minute?\r\n ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Rafe: Where's Lucy? ",
        "Kevin: Well, let's see. The last time I saw \r\nyour cousin Lucy was in a hotel room with some \r\nother guy. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. ",
        "Kevin: Oh. You got the picture? Good. Good \r\nnight, Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Look, you know Lucy. So no matter what \r\nyou saw, remember what you know, and you'll know \r\nthings aren't what they seem. Just look inside \r\nyourself. ",
        "Kevin: Do you actually believe half the garbage \r\nthat spews from your mouth? Or do you just like to \r\nhear yourself talk? ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Christina. ",
        "Lucy: Christina? Oh, excuse me. Get out of my \r\nway, that's my little girl! That's my daughter! \r\nChristina? Christina, it's mommy! Christina!\r\n ",
        "Karen: All right, Ramsey. Tell frank. Go on, do \r\nit. But please, let me be there to watch when he \r\nputs your face through the nearest window. ",
        "Chris: And why would he do that? ",
        "Karen: Because that's what will happen when I tell him that you filled the syringe. Frank will \r\njump to my side and defend me. ",
        "Chris: You're sure about that? ",
        "Karen: He loves me. ",
        "Chris: No, he loves Karen. And you and I both \r\nknow that you're not quite Karen anymore, are you? \r\nYou know, and maybe you and frank eventually tie \r\nthe knot and have babies. Don't you think he might \r\nfreak out when junior's baby teeth come in all \r\nsharp and pointy?  ",
        "\u00a0",
        "Chris: No, not yet. But that serum was \r\nexperimental. You could pop fangs and start \r\ncraving blood any minute. Are you going to do what I ask? You going to run some tests or should I \r\nhave a little chat with your boyfriend? Fine. ",
        "Karen: Stop. You want a blood sample? Fine. \r\nLet's get this over with. ",
        "Chris: Yes, ma'am. I had a feeling you'd see \r\nthings my way. ",
        "Frank: So eve thinks you killed this woman's \r\nhusband and then went after her. ",
        "Ian: And she also thinks that I kidnap women, \r\nmake them fall in love with me, and then try to \r\nkill them. ",
        "Frank: And she believes this? ",
        "Ian: I don't know what she believes anymore. \r\nShe's concerned for herself, she's concerned for \r\nthe baby, and she has Kevin poisoning her mind.\r\n ",
        "Frank: A bad guy ",
        "Ian: Regardless. Someone's feeding them lies. \r\nHe believes it. And now there's a 10-foot wall \r\nbetween eve and me. ",
        "Frank: Ok. All right, I'll do whatever I can to \r\nhelp. Just say the word. ",
        "Ian: I've said the word. ",
        "Frank: \"Computer.\" Ok. All right. ",
        "Ian: Now, this woman sending these letters -- I -- ",
        "frank: Anne-Marie. ",
        "Ian: And -- well, it's not Anne Marie. I saw Anne Marie die in Africa. ",
        "Frank: So what you need is to find proof to \r\ncorroborate your story. ",
        "Ian: I need to find whoever's pretending to be Anne Marie. ",
        "Eve: Livvie.  ",
        "I'm sorr -- ",
        "eve: Shh, shh, shh, shh. I just put Danny down. \r\nCome on in. Come in. What's wrong? ",
        "Livvie: Nothing's wrong. I just think I left my \r\nsweater here, that's all. ",
        "Eve: Really? I don't remember seeing a sweater \r\nhere. ",
        "Livvie: Well, do you mind if I look around? I \r\nmean it -- it blends in with everything, and you \r\ncould probably be staring at it and never know it \r\nwas here. I'll be really quiet, I promise. ",
        "Eve: Livvie, Livvie. You didn't really leave a \r\nsweater here, did you? ",
        "Livvie: No. You're right. I'm sorry, it was a \r\nreally lame excuse. Um -- eve, I just needed \r\nsomeone to talk to and there isn't anyone.\r\n ",
        "\u00a0We broke up. Jack and I -- ",
        "eve: I am so sorry, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: That's what I feel, so sorry and -- and \r\nsad and alone. ",
        "Eve: Well, hey, there's a lot of that going \r\naround right now. ",
        "Livvie: What? I -- oh. God, eve. You and Ian? \r\nLook, I am so sorry. I'll just go -- ",
        "eve: No. No, don't go because this way at least \r\nyou know that the person you're talking to knows \r\nexactly what you're going through. ",
        "Livvie: I guess. Hey, eve, is there anything I can do for you? ",
        "Eve: Actually, there is one thing.\r\n ",
        "Eve: Ok, but it's kind of a big favor. You have \r\nno idea how big until you have a child of your \r\nown. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, whatever it is, please. ",
        "Eve: Ok. I really need to take a shower. And \r\nI'm afraid to leave Danny alone for one minute.\r\n",
        "Livvie: You want me to watch him? ",
        "Eve: Could you, please? Just five minutes? ",
        "Livvie: Yes! I would love to watch him. ",
        "Eve: Shh! ",
        "Livvie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: Ok, thank you, thank you. ",
        "Livvie: Take all the time you need. I'm here, \r\nok? ",
        "Eve: Ok, he's asleep right now. He should be no \r\ntrouble at all. If you need anything, you just \r\nhelp yourself to whatever's in the fridge, ok?\r\n ",
        "\u00a0 ",
        "Livvie: Ok, relax. I am not going anywhere. \r\nI'll just get everything ready in the kitchen. ",
        "[Caleb's music plays] ",
        "[answering machine beeps] ",
        "Ian's voice: I know what you must be thinking \r\nabout me right now, but none of it is true, you \r\ngot to believe me. I would never hurt you or my \r\nson. I just want my family back. ",
        "Caleb's voice: Oh, I think we can leave a \r\nbetter message than that. ",
        "Ian's voice: I will die before I let you \r\nbelieve those lies. ",
        "Rafe: I believe everything I say, Kevin. You \r\nknow that. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if I hear one more empty platitude \r\nabout the power of love, I'm going to throw you \r\noff this bridge. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of \r\neverything.  ",
        "Now, did you talk \r\nto Lucy? Did you even give her a chance to \r\nexplain? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, I talked to her. The devil made her \r\ndo it. Or rather, Caleb made her do it. Dead or \r\nalive, he's still her prime suspect. ",
        "Rafe: Well, what if she's not wrong? ",
        "Kevin: Really? Speaking as a vampire slayer?\r\n",
        "Rafe: Speaking as someone who's had some \r\nexperience -- ",
        "Kevin: Well, we've all had some experience now, Rafe. We've all been through vampires and\r\nTransylvania and lightning bolts from the clear \r\nblue sky. But who are you, anyway? ",
        "Rafe: What? I don't understand. ",
        "Kevin: You show up here out of nowhere spouting \r\nout greeting card slogans and all of a sudden all \r\nof our lives suddenly turn to hell.\r\n ",
        "Kevin: Well, you know, maybe Lucy's right. \r\nMaybe there is an evil force out there somewhere.\r\n",
        "Rafe: That's good. At least you're finally --\r\n",
        "Kevin: And maybe it's connected to our friend Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, no way. That's crazy. ",
        "Kevin: Really? Well, it wouldn't be the first \r\ntime evil showed up here pretending to be \r\nsomething else. What do we really know about you? \r\nI mean, except what you've told us. And your bag \r\nof magic tricks. ",
        "Rafe: Dr. Collins -- ",
        "Kevin: You've got Lucy running around like \r\nchicken little screaming that the sky is falling. \r\nMeanwhile, we're all looking up at the clouds, and \r\nour lives are falling apart around us!\r\n ",
        "Kevin: Just maybe -- just maybe you put those \r\nwild ideas into Lucy's head just to get -- ",
        "Rafe: No, no. Wait a second. You know that's \r\nnot why I'm -- ",
        "Kevin: Don't tell me what I know -- now who are \r\nyou? ",
        "Lucy: Doc? Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: Answer me! ",
        "Lucy: I have to talk to you. ",
        "Kevin: Who the hell are you? ",
        "Lucy: Doc! Doc, listen to me, I have to talk to \r\nyou. It's about Christina. ",
        "Frank: There's nothing on that nurse in any \r\nd.M.V. File or on the doctors without limits web \r\nsite. ",
        "Ian: We need to find her. We all worked \r\ntogether in Africa. ",
        "Frank: Well, so far there's no record she even \r\nexisted.  ",
        "Rafe: The file's been erased. ",
        "Frank: Any idea by who? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. The only man that hates me \r\nenough to do this would've been Harris. ",
        "Frank: Well, that's a great scapegoat, but he's \r\ndead. ",
        "Ian: Well, whoever did this did one hell of a \r\njob setting me up. How can I prove to Eve that I didn't murder anyone if there's no proof in the \r\nfirst place? Lucy thinks there's some -- there's \r\nsome thing making this happen. ",
        "Frank: Thing? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. Something that Caleb left \r\nbehind. Makes as much sense as everything else we \r\nknow. ",
        "Frank: All I know is when the woman I love is \r\nhurting, I do whatever I can just to make her feel \r\nbetter, Ian. That's me.  ",
        "Ian: Not ",
        "frank: All I'm saying is you need to do \r\nwhatever you can. Win or lose, whatever it takes, \r\njust go to her. ",
        "Eve: Livvie, what are you doing? ",
        "Livvie: Am I making too much noise? ",
        "Eve: No. No, not at all. It's just that you \r\ndon't have to do that. ",
        "Livvie: I know, I know. But taking care of Daniel all alone is so hard. ",
        "Eve: No. Taking care of Daniel is not the hard \r\npart. It's trying to fit everything else into your \r\nday that's hard. ",
        "Livvie: But doing it all alone is not the way \r\nyou planned, is it? All right, should I ask? ",
        "Eve: No. I don't want go there, ok?\r\n ",
        "Eve: You know, you think you know somebody \r\ninside and out. And then one day it turns out that \r\nyou don't really know them as well as you thought \r\nyou did. ",
        "Livvie: What did Ian do? ",
        "Eve: I don't want to talk about it, ok? I don't \r\nwant to talk about me. Let's just -- let's talk \r\nabout you. What's going on with you and jack? ",
        "Livvie: Reality, I guess. I think he just got \r\nsick of taking on all my baggage. ",
        "Eve: It's strange, isn't it? You make this \r\ncommitment to someone and that means you have to \r\naccept everything about them -- the good and the \r\nbad -- on blind faith. And then one day you get a \r\ngood look at the bad.  ",
        "Livvie: I can't blame him. I \r\nmean, I think he just saw who I was and decided \r\nhe'd be better off without me. ",
        "Eve: Well, I am not better off without Ian. I \r\nfeel lost. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, I never said I felt better. ",
        "Eve: Well, it sounds like the two of us are \r\nhoping that things will work out, right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. You know, I think there's a \r\nmessage on your machine. I saw the light blinking \r\nwhen you were in the shower and I thought maybe Ian left a message. ",
        "Eve: No. Probably not. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Eve, come on. There's only one way \r\nto find out, right?  ",
        "Ian's voice: Eve. Pick up. I know you're there. \r\nAnd I won't let you leave me. I'll do what I have \r\nto, whatever it takes. You will die first. Do you \r\nhear me? ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian's voice: I won't let it happen. I won't let \r\nyou go, Lambert. ",
        "[Answering machine beeps] ",
        "Livvie: Eve? Are you ok? ",
        "Eve: That wasn't him. That wasn't Ian. That was \r\n-- did you -- that was -- that was him. That had \r\nto be him. You heard what he said, right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, yeah, so -- ",
        "Eve: He said that and he meant every word! ",
        "Livvie: Eve, what are you going to do? I mean, \r\nyou can't just ignore a message like that, can \r\nyou? I mean, I know you love him and everything, \r\nbut -- eve, who are you calling? Eve?\r\n ",
        "Eve: Hi, it's Eve. I need your help. I need a \r\nreally big favor. ",
        "Kevin: I think you'd better leave. ",
        "Lucy: No, did you hear what I said? ",
        "Kevin: I heard you, Lucy, and I think you \r\nbetter go right now. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, please, listen to me -- it's Christina. I saw her. Christina. ",
        "Rafe: You know what? I think I'd better go. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, no you don't. I'm not done with you.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Doc, please, listen to me, please. ",
        "Kevin: I listened to you, Lucy! I listened to \r\nyou. What, are you here to explain? Is that it? \r\nYou were sad about Christina so you took comfort \r\nin Ian?  ",
        "Lucy: No! This is this is about Christina, doc. \r\nI saw her. I saw her at the hotel. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, she was there. She was in this \r\nlittle red slicker and I saw her and I ran after \r\nher. She looked at me and she smiled. I'd know \r\nthose eyes anywhere. And then I went to get her, \r\nand all of the sudden she disappeared, she was \r\njust gone. My little baby was there. ",
        "Kevin: All right, Lucy. Lucy, I'm sorry. I \r\ndon't know what it is that you saw. ",
        "Lucy: Don't touch me. Don't -- don't touch me. \r\nYou don't believe me, do you? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: No, you don't! You're not even listening \r\nto me! I saw her, and you don't believe me!\r\n ",
        "All right, what do you want? ",
        "Lab technician: To stop getting double-stamped \r\nblood test orders from you. ",
        "Chris: You're done already? ",
        "Lab technician: Yeah. They're freaky, too. Have \r\nfun. ",
        "Chris: Freaky? ",
        "Chris: No, this can't be right. These numbers \r\ndon't make any sense. I mean, just -- unless Karen is -- unless Karen is mutating. ",
        "Livvie: Look, it was the right thing, Eve. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. I don't want to talk about this \r\nright now. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Sure, whatever you say. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Wve: I can't deal with company right now at \r\nall.  ",
        "Ian: Eve, it's Ian. ",
        "Livvie: What do you want me to do? ",
        "Eve: Let him in. ",
        "Ian: Hey, little one. What are you doing here?\r\n",
        "Eve: What are you doing here, Ian? ",
        "Ian: Did you get my message? ",
        "Eve: Yes, I did. ",
        "Ian: Well, then you know how much I love you.\r\n",
        "Eve: I can't live with that kind of love \r\nanymore. Here. ",
        "Ian: What kind of love? What is this? A \r\nrestraining order? ",
        "Eve: Come within 200 feet of me or the baby, \r\nand I will call the police. ",
        "Ian: Don't do this. ",
        "Eve: Please, just go. ",
        "[Daniel cries] ",
        "Ian: Danny --  ",
        "Eve: Whatever it takes. You can't threaten me. ",
        "Ian: Threaten you? ",
        "Eve: Just -- go, please. Livvie, call 911. ",
        "Ian: Put the phone down. You -- I'm not here to \r\nhurt anybody. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Go. Door's right there. ",
        "Ian: I -- I have no idea what this is about. \r\nBut my love for you is stronger than this. And \r\nI'll prove it to you. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Eve. I'm so sorry. ",
        "Eve: Oh, Ian. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, please, just listen to me. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, you don't believe me and you \r\ncan't take that back. ",
        "Rafe: Hold on. Christina, Lucy. Tell us more \r\nabout that.  ",
        "Lucy: At the Luther hotel. She was alone. Julie wasn't with \r\nher. ",
        "Kevin: Alone? In the middle of the night, in a \r\nhotel? Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I know -- I know how it sounds. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it couldn't have been her! ",
        "Lucy: I know it was. I know it was my daughter. \r\nI would know her anywhere. ",
        "Kevin: You did this. ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Kevin: First you show her a vision of her own \r\ndeath and then the thing she wants most in the \r\nworld. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not that! I did see her! I would \r\nknow my daughter, doc. I saw her! ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Scott has had a small army looking \r\nfor Christina for over a year. They've never \r\nturned up a single clue.  ",
        "\u00a0",
        "Kevin: Well, what possible reason would Julie have to bring her here now? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I don't know! I know, \r\nthough, that I saw her. You know, Ian said the \r\nwoman you saw has been dead for years and that \r\nwasn't a hallucination. But what I saw -- I saw Christina -- you're making that out to be a \r\nhallucination. Why? Because it's me saying it? ",
        "Kevin: That's not what I said! ",
        "Lucy: Well, then what is it? Are you like the \r\nchief justice of the supreme court of the \r\nuniverse? ",
        "Rafe: Stop, stop -- do you guys not see what \r\nyou're doing? You're tearing at each other when \r\nyou need each other most. ",
        "Kevin: Well, why don't you take your mystic \r\nself back to where you came from.\r\n ",
        "Lucy: Leave ",
        "Kevin: You know what? I'll leave you both \r\nalone. How does that suit you? Suits me fine \r\nbecause I'm sick of the Kovich's and the coes. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm sick of the Collins's! How's \r\nthat? ",
        "Rafe: Lucy, go after him. ",
        "Lucy: No! Why? He doesn't deserve me. ",
        "Rafe: You don't believe that. ",
        "Lucy: I don't. I -- I don't know anything I \r\nbelieve anymore, absolutely anything. And I do not \r\nhave the person that I usually have to talk to \r\nwhen I need to find something, when I need to find \r\nmyself. I don't have that anymore. ",
        "Rafe: Don't stop believing in him. ",
        "Lucy: I'm not talking just about him, Rafe. I \r\nhappen to be talking about you, too.\r\n ",
        "Lucy: Is that what you call this? Is that what \r\n-- ever since you came here, everything is just a \r\nhuge mess! ",
