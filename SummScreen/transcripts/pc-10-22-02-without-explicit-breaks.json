        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Marissa: You awake? ",
        "Jamal: What's up, sweet girl? Hell, yeah, I'm awake. The more you kiss me, the more I'm going to get up.",
        "Marissa: Yeah, well, join the club, because I'm already there. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, is that right? ",
        "Marissa: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Jamal: Ah. ",
        "Marissa: I just couldn't get to sleep thinking about it. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, I'm liking that. ",
        "Marissa: Trust me, you're going to love this. ",
        "Jamal: Oh. Well, then you know what? I'm all yours. I'll tell you right now, girl, talking like that to me. ",
        "Marissa: Get ready for the new lyrics I'm writing for Stephen Clay. ",

        "Reese: Well, well, well. Look who it is, boys. My man Ricky came to thank me for untying him. ",
        "Ricky: Now, now, now, that was just a misunderstanding. Joshua and I talked about it. So, where's the big guy? ",
        "Reese: Oh, he's very busy, but I could make a little time for you. ",
        "Ricky: Maybe some other time. Right now I'd like to talk to Joshua. ",
        "Joshua: Consider it done. Thanks for coming over, Ricky. That'll be all, Reese. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, it's not a problem. Actually, I was really glad that you called. ",
        "Joshua: Oh? ",
        "Ricky: Marissa's really psyched about these new lyrics, so I figured I\u2019d stay in the same groove. ",
        "Joshua: Did you, now? ",
        "Ricky: Yes, I did. And I have been working on some new tracks and I figured you guys could listen to them, if that's cool with you guys. ",
        "Joshua: I'm afraid it's not. ",
        "Ricky: It's not? Is this a bad time? I mean, I can come back later, if you want. ",
        "Joshua: This is very hard for me to say, my friend, but we no longer require your services. ",

        "Alison: Uh-uh. I couldn't sleep. ",
        "Rafe: Because I took the phone off the hook, you know. ",
        "Alison: I know. I noticed. Thank you. ",

        "Alison: I know, but it just seems like we just found our way back to each other just a few weeks ago, and now all of a sudden there's, like, this giant black cloud hanging over us and -- I mean, everything with, like, my dad and now my mom coming back and telling all these lies and -- I mean, you've been so good about it and I was just thinking and I just -- well, I wanted \u2013 ",

        "Alison: No, but not really like I want to be. You know what I mean? ",
        "Rafe: It's ok. ",
        "Alison: No, it's not, and I just wanted to tell you that I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Rafe: It's ok. ",
        "Alison: I really just want to shut all of the bad stuff out for right now, and I really want to focus on us. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Alison: I want to just be here. I want to be right here, and I want it to just be us, ok? ",

        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Marissa: I can't -- I just can't go to sleep. You know, I've been writing nonstop ever since we left that meeting with Joshua tonight. ",

        "Marissa: Yes, exactly, and you know what? You promised, hon. You promised you were not going to tell a soul that Joshua is the mysterious Stephen Clay. Cross your heart, hope to die. Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Stick a needle in my eye. ",
        "Marissa: Now -- I really think that I\u2019ve captured him in these words, but, you know, I need to know what you think honestly. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Marissa: It's not totally done and I haven't showed it to anyone yet because I wanted the most wonderful, handsomest, supportive man I know \u2013 ",

        "Marissa: Ahem. I call it \"the gift.\" \"Looking in the mirror through a newborn's eyes, I found my ticket back here with brand-new wings to fly. Here to finish what I started and take my curtain call, to cash in all my favors and knock down all the walls. Because I'm the man you build your dreams on, your savior on the stage, the object of your passion, the fire that stokes your rage. I\u2019m the gift that keeps on giving, and all I ask for me is your love and adulation unconditionally.\" ",

        "Jamal: Ahem. ",
        "Marissa: You're worried about me hooking up with Stephen Clay? ",
        "Jamal: No, I think you need to take a deep breath, maybe take a few steps back, you know, just so we can make sure everything's legit, that's all. ",
        "Marissa: Yeah, honey, but I am. I'm sure. I'm \u2013 ",
        "Jamal: But I think you're getting, like, totally caught up in this whole Stephen Clay thing. You know what I'm saying? Plus, that band -- it -- uh-uh. ",
        "Marissa: Honey, this is a chance of a lifetime, ok? ",
        "Jamal: I know. ",
        "Marissa: A dream that can just never come true, and it's something that I never even knew that I wanted. Ok? So I don't understand where this is all coming from. No, wait a minute. I know that look. ",
        "Jamal: What look? ",
        "Marissa: Oh, come on. You know, the \"maybe I\u2019m just a little bit jealous\" look? ",

        "Jamal: Oh, and what's that? ",
        "Marissa: That you will always come first. Always. ",
        "Jamal: Well, thank you for telling me that, but that's still not it. ",
        "Marissa: No, and I could prove it. I could totally prove it. I have this song, and it's \u2013 ",
        "Jamal: Oh, you wrote another song for the band? ",
        "Marissa: It's more -- no, no, no. It's not for the band. ",

        "Alison: What just happened here? You should've seen the look on both of your faces when that song came on. You hate that song that much? ",
        "Rafe: No, I don't hate it. It just bugs me a lot, that's all. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, bugs me a lot, too. ",
        "Alison: That's weird because I happen to actually like that song. I'm going to get a robe on. Ok. ",
        "Lucy: What just happened here, cousin? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I just know that's not the first time that song made me feel that way. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah? Me, too. ",
        "Rafe: Me, too. When did you first feel it? ",
        "Lucy: Canada -- Kevin in the hospital. I heard that song and all of a sudden I got the strangest feeling. I had to get out of there. I had to come home to Port Charles right away. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah, yeah, when Alison and I were on the train, that's -- I heard it, I felt that way, and I felt like I had to get back to Port Charles. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. Ok. What -- what do you think this means? ",
        "Rafe: I'm not sure. Maybe it has something to do with why I\u2019m getting some of my powers back. ",
        "Lucy: What? Are you trying to tell me you're actually getting your angel powers back? ",
        "Rafe: Uh -- well, um, yeah and -- and no. I don't know. See -- hmm -- the thing is, is -- well, I'm starting to get some of my old magic back and I don't know why or how, but it's not supposed to happen this way. I mean, I was supposed to come back here and just be a normal guy, you know, just a normal, regular kind of mortal guy! ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. So what does this mean? So, what happened? ",
        "Rafe: So I turned a yellow rose into a pink one.",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, you know -- are you sure? Because maybe you just thought it in your brain. Maybe it didn't really \u2013 ",
        "Rafe: And then -- and then I got into Alison's head. I mean, into her dreams, you know, right -- right in here. I wanted to help her because I wanted to give her some closure with her father, but I was there! I was right there! ",
        "Lucy: But that's kind of sweet. That's really nice you did that. That's a good thing, right? Right? ",
        "Rafe: Well, yeah -- yeah! Sure, yeah! Yeah, it is! It's a little odd, too, though, don't you think? I mean -- just everything in this town feels a little off lately. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, yeah. You know what? So that means I need to tell you what happened with Livvie just now. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, boy. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. She snuck out of the hospital, right, first. ",
        "Rafe: You mean after she heard about the baby? ",
        "Lucy: Exactly, and -- and then I found her. Rafe, she was wandering on the side of the road totally disoriented. I mean, weird, not like herself at all and she was clutching this little doll, and I thought for a minute maybe she was just having some sort of nervous breakdown. ",
        "Rafe: Well, that's not so weird having a reaction like that after losing a baby. ",
        "Lucy: But that's not what it is. I can feel it. You know how i am with people. Livvie was not Livvie. I mean, she was, but it didn't feel like her. It just wasn't exactly her and I don't understand it. All I know is there's something going on here. It's like something out there is messing with us again and I just keep getting this feeling stronger and stronger and stronger. ",
        "Rafe: Whatever it is, I don't like it. I'm starting to feel like I'm going nuts. ",
        "Alison: Look, Rafe, I don't -- I don't think that it's -- it's just you, because I'm starting to feel the same way, too. I think I know why. ",

        "Ricky: It's not personal? You just fired me. ",

        "Alison: Well, I mean, it's so obvious. It's my mother. That's why everybody feels so off and on edge. I mean, look at all the chaos that she's caused. And every single time she tells us more lies, it just makes me hate her that much more. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it's -- you know, I think \"hate\" is a pretty strong word. ",
        "Alison: Well, you've only been back here on earth for, like, a couple of weeks, and yet all of our time has been consumed by her chaos. ",
        "Lucy: Um -- I guess that'd be Elizabeth, huh? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",

        "Alison: You what? ",
        "Lucy: Well, you know, obviously, maybe perhaps I could've been off a little. Maybe it's not working quite the way I thought. ",
        "Alison: No, it's been a nightmare. ",
        "Lucy: What -- what I\u2019m trying to tell you is, Alison, I spent my whole life without my parents. I had all these burning questions I needed answered and I couldn't get them answered. ",
        "Alison: Because they died. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, because they died. But Elizabeth is here, and you get to walk up to your mother and you get to ask her why. \"Why did you leave me?\" Now, listen, you don't have to like her. You don't have to want to be around her, but you get to ask her that. And you certainly don't have to love her, she has to earn that. But, for goodness sake, at least take the opportunity to say \"why?\" ",
        "Alison: I'm not sure I really want to know. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Yeah, Alison, you do want to know, believe me. If you don't ask Elizabeth, she could just walk away and then you'll lose your chance. You need this for yourself to feel whole and maybe to get some sort of sense of closure. ",
        "Alison: I don't know, Lucy. I mean, how do you just walk up to your mother and say, \"why didn't you want me?\" ",
        "Lucy: Hey, I know it won't be easy. But trust me, I know it would be a lot harder going through life never even knowing. ",
        "Lucy: Go on. It'll be all right, I promise. ",
        "Alison: Hi, Elizabeth -- uh, mother. It's Alison. Um, I was wondering if, at some point tomorrow, you would want to go talk. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, now, well, maybe you're right. Maybe Alison does need answers. I just don't want to see her get any more hurt. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you can't protect her from her own life. ",
        "Rafe: I know, I know. You're right. Man, I wish I knew why Elizabeth was really here. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then why don't you try and start getting some answers, cousin? ",
        "Rafe: Believe me, I will. I'm just not 100% sure that Alison\u2019s mom is the reason for all these strange feelings we're both feeling. ",
        "Lucy: I don't think she is at all. I think there is something definitely strange going on, and you know who can get the answers, don't you? ",
