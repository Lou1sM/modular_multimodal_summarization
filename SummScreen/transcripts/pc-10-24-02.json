", "Rafe: Well, since you had such an extraordinary time, you wouldn't mind if Alison and I had a little alone time together? ", "Alison: Actually, I'm sorry. I asked her to stay. ", "Rafe: Stay? ", "Alison: Well, yeah. I thought maybe I could use a little bit of her help. You know, I just wanted to get things ready for tonight. Um -- Nana and the lawyer are coming over to read my father's will. ", "Elizabeth: I offered to help Alison get things ready tonight. ", "Alison: Yeah. ", "Rafe: Well, thanks, Elizabeth. That's considerate, but I think we can manage. ", "Alison: I actually would really appreciate her help. I wanted to make some of my Nana's favorite things, you know, so that it wasn't so cold in here tonight, so it just seemed a little bit warmer.

So one day you met a girl who lived in a cave that nurses you back to health who just happens to look exactly like Livvie, right? ", "Jack: You know what? I'm done arguing with you. ", "Jamal: Look, I'm just trying to understand, brother, that's it. ", "Jack: Well, you'll understand when Chris gets back and you see the x-rays that I had a broken leg two weeks ago. ", "Jamal: That she fixed? No cast, no splints, no crutches, no nothing -- and you just walked away? ", "Jack: Actually, she turned my arms into wings and I flew home. ", "Jamal: Come on, dude. This day is long enough already. Just chill out", "[SCENE_BREAK]", ". ", "Chris: Well, we should have you out of here in no time. ", "Jamal: What's up, Chris? ", "Chris: Jamal. ", "Jamal: Hey. ", "Chris: Got your results back. It's good news. ", "Jack: So my leg's doing better? Is \u2013 ", "Chris: Yeah, you could say that, I guess. ", "Jack: Well, what? ", "Chris: Well, I checked and then I rechecked them, but your x-rays don't show anything. In fact, I can't find any evidence that you ever broke your leg at all.

", "Livvie: Yeah, but it's not like him to keep me waiting like this. He knows how much I need him.", "Nurse: Well, you may not have to wait long. I just saw him down in x-ray a while ago. I'm sure he'll be up soon. ", "Livvie: Jack was in x-ray? All right. Something must've happened to him. Ow. Ow. That explains why he hasn't been here to see me. I wonder what happened.

", "Marissa: Ricky \u2013 ", "Ricky: Now's not a good time. ", "Marissa: No, dude, I am so in the zone, I can't -- I couldn't stop writing all night.

", "Chris: Not a chance, pal. ", "Jamal: Well, maybe you misread it and made a mistake or something. ", "Jack: Yeah. ", "Chris: No, I don't make mistakes. And it's nearly impossible to misread a fracture x-ray. I mean, even after a break is completely healed, a third-rate doctor is going to be able to tell where it was.

Look, this was real, Tess was real, and I had a broken leg. ", "Jamal: I believe you. ", "Jack: You know, I don't even know why I bother with you. This is ridiculous. ", "Jamal: Dude, what is up with you, man? You've been hounding me all day about this. The second I say I believe you, you turn and walk away. ", "Jack: Ok, so you're telling me you believe me. ", "Jamal: As crazy as it sounds, yeah. ", "Jack: Why? ", "Jamal: Because I know that you don't have a good enough imagination to make up all this stuff on your own. So now what? ", "Jack: Well, we've got to find Tess fast. ", "Jamal: Whoa, you don't want to tell Chris the whole story and maybe he can run some other kind of test to find out what she really did to your leg or something? ", "Jack: No, no, no, I don't want to bring a lot of people in on this. I want to find out who she is and if she's connected to Livvie, so let's just keep it between me and you right now.

We told you that you needed to -- why are you dressed like this? And what's with the hair, hon? It looks like you threw it up in the air and ran under it.

", "Elizabeth: Well, my future son-in-law obviously has a lot to learn about me. It may take a little time. ", "Rafe: Maybe not as much time as you think. ", "Alison: Hey. What's going on? ", "Elizabeth: I think it's my fault. Rafe obviously wanted to spend some time alone with you, but in all honesty, there is something very important that I need to discuss with you guys. ", "Alison: Look, look, look, wait, wait, wait, wait, please. I know this is a very crazy time for everyone. There's something very strange about the reading of a person's will.

These are so good, so let's have a cookie or \u2013 ", "Rafe: No, hey, hey \u2013 ", "Alison: Talk about something really positive like our wedding. That's awesome. ", "Rafe: Let's just forget about this whole thing, all right? Let's postpone the reading of the will, all right? ", "Elizabeth: I think that's an excellent idea. I'll call your grandmother and invite her to dinner. ", "Alison: Wait. What \u2013 ", "Rafe: I just -- look \u2013 ", "Alison: What's going on here? ", "Rafe: You've already had such a big day, and I think it'd be good if you -- just come with me, ok?

They thought it was -- wait, what was that word that Joshua used? \"Pedestrian,\" yes. \"Pedestrian.\" ", "Marissa: They can't do that. ", "Ricky: Yeah. They just did. They never wanted me. They were just interested in you, ok? They could've saved us the hassle if they would've told us that from the beginning. ", "Marissa: No, Ricky, they're wrong, ok? They're wrong. All right? You are a good musician, a really good musician, and you know that. You know what? I'll just go over there and then make them give you another chance.
