", "Alison: It would've been so much easier if you would've just been honest with me and told me about this stupid money rather than play this whole pathetic mother bull! God!

", "Jack: Do -- do I need to get a doctor? ", "Livvie: No, no, it's not pain. It's -- it's like this strange, weird, cold feeling. I mean, I don't know. I guess it's maybe from losing the baby. ", "Jack: Well, you probably just need to get some rest. ", "Livvie: No. What I need is to be back in our house again, with you. Honey, remember how happy we were when we found it? It was really the only real home either one of us ever had. ", "Jack: Look, Livvie, I -- that's kind of what I need to talk to you about, kind of where we go from here. ", "Livvie: Yeah, I know. I've been thinking about the same thing, too, and -- you know what? I want to do things right this time, and I don't think we should move in together. ", "Jack: I totally agree. ", "Livvie: Well, not until we get married, at least. ", "Jack: Married? ", "Livvie: Yeah. I know how much you wanted to get married before, and I guess I just wasn't ready. But, honey, I'm ready now. ", "Jack: Livvie \u2013 ", "Livvie: I'm ready to \u2013 ", "jack: Stop. Don't do this. ", "Livvie: What do you mean?

Whatever Stephen wants, Stephen gets. ", "Marissa: No. No, you must have had me bugged or you -- you had a camera placed somewhere because that is the only way that you would've gotten these lyrics. ", "Joshua: Isn't that a little bit paranoid? ", "Marissa: Me paranoid? You're calling me paranoid? I don't think so. I'm not the one creating secret identities. ", "Joshua: Stephen doesn't have a secret identity. He's just a very private person. ", "Marissa: Oh, god, will you please stop about this Stephen Clay like he's someone else? All right, it's starting to freak me out. ", "Joshua: Don't worry. In due time, you will meet Stephen. ", "Marissa: I've already met him. In fact, I\u2019m talking to him right now. You are Stephen Clay, ok? You know it, I know it, and frankly I am so over this cloak-and-dagger stuff that you know what? You can call yourself anything you want. Just don't call me, ok? Lose my number. ", "Joshua: I'm sorry, love, but I can't let you leave. ", " ", "Marissa: You think you could lock me here and force me to work with you? ", "Joshua: I think you and I need to have a little uninterrupted chat. ", "Marissa: Well, Jamal is waiting for me at home. And if I don't get home soon, then he is going to start looking for me. ", "Joshua: I'm only trying to warn you. ", "Marissa: Is -- is that some kind of threat? ", "Joshua: No, on the contrary. I'm only trying to help you. If you walk away from this opportunity, you're in danger of losing the best thing that has ever happened to you. ", "Marissa: The -- the best -- ok. Well, let me see here. I've been bugged, held hostage, watched my friend get kicked to the curb. You know what? If this is the crazy, glamorous lifestyle of a rock musician, you can count me out, ok? ", "Joshua: Don't be so foolish. Marissa, you're not a dime-a-dozen musician. You're not like Ricky Garza. ", "Marissa: Ricky is my friend, and he is very talented. ", "Joshua: Ok, he has a little talent -- I\u2019ll give you that -- and he also has a sort of roguish charm that happens to be in right now. But you have a gift. You have a pure gift. You haven't begun to realize your potential, but Stephen has recognized it. And he is the only one that can help to bring you to the heights. ", "Marissa: Yeah, well, what if I only want to write for me? Ok, what if I don't even want to be a songwriter after all? ", "Joshua: You know that's not true. I've seen the way the music gets inside of you and lifts you up. I've seen the way the words drop from your fingertips like gems. I've seen that look of sheer joy on your face when you get caught in a thought or a lyric. It's the same look that Stephen gets. It's the look of genius. So the question is, Marissa, are you prepared to walk away from the kind of life that most people only dream about, or do you owe it to yourself to stay  and become what you're destined to be?

Is that just another one of your scams? ", "Elizabeth: It means that I'm dropping this lawsuit. It means that I am not contesting your father's will. Alison, this was all a terrible mistake. ", "Rafe: You expect her to believe that? ", "Elizabeth: You know, actually, no, I don't because, in all honesty, I did come to town with less than honest motives. But back then, Alison, I didn't know you. You were just a face in some photographs. You were someone that my assistant mailed the birthday cards to every year \u2013 ", "Alison: God, it's amazing how someone I barely know has the power to hurt me that much. ", "Elizabeth: Baby, I know. My life hasn't been exactly easy, either. ", "Alison: Oh, don't do that. Do not give me the whole sob story about being a Barrington is so hard. I know the money and the mansions and the clothes \u2013 ", "Elizabeth: Yes, and your father and his disinterest and his rejection and his numerous and expensive infidelities over all of the years. I just didn't think that it was fair for you to have half of the estate because I felt like I had deserved it all, that somehow I\u2019d earned it. ", "Alison: Yeah, like a two-bit whore who earns her keep? ", "Elizabeth: Yeah. Maybe. ", "Alison: Yeah. You thought that having all the money in the world would make you happy? How pathetic is that? ", "Rafe: You know, Alison and I -- we don't have much, but we have all that we'd ever want or need. It's too bad you'll never know what that feels like.

", "Elizabeth: I didn't expect to come here and fall in love with my daughter. ", "Alison: Just save it. ", "Elizabeth: No, Alison, would you listen? It is true. I didn't know you. You were -- you were a face in a photograph. Now I can't dismiss you. I mean, look at you. You are such an incredible, loving person, and all I want is for you to be in my life. That's all I want. That's why I\u2019m not contesting this will. That's why I\u2019m dropping that lawsuit. All I want -- I want nothing except to be your mother. Will you just let me do that? ", "Elizabeth: Sweetie, could we just start over? I just -- I want to make this up to you. I want to make everything up to you. ", "Rafe: Come on. Let's go. Don't you have somewhere to be? ", "Elizabeth: I'm talking to my daughter. ", "Alison: No, no. Don't you call me that. ", "Elizabeth: Please \u2013 ", "Alison: Don't you ever call me that again. ", "Elizabeth: Just give me another chance. ", "Alison: A chance to do what? To make a fool of me again? Do you really think I'm that stupid? ", "Elizabeth: No. I think you're kind and you are compassionate. God knows you didn't inherit that from me. I am just hoping that you could at least feel some of that compassion for my situation right now. ", "Alison: The only thing I feel -- I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for you that you will never know what a terrific daughter you have, what an awesome husband I have. And I feel sorry for you that you will never hold your grandchild in your arms. ", "Elizabeth: No, please, Alison, don't say \u2013 ", "Alison: We're not going to be baking anymore, ok? And you're not going to be there with me when I get ready for my wedding. And you will not be there to watch me walk down the aisle because God knows you might have something better to do -- maybe be with another millionaire or be off at another cool party. ", "Elizabeth: Rafe, could you please just talk to her for a minute? ", "Rafe: Excuse me? You -- you want my help? What -- what do you want me to tell her? To let you back into her life again so you can hurt her again? ", "Elizabeth: Everybody makes mistakes. ", "Rafe: You abandoned her as a baby. And then you come back and you work your way back into her heart so you can steal her inheritance. Ok, so making mistakes is one thing, but being a cold-hearted -- Ahem -- snake is another. ", "Elizabeth: Is that how you feel? ", "Alison: You know what the really sad thing is, is that I would've given you the money. I would've given all of it to you because I don't really care about money. I never have. But now I wouldn't even give you the change in my pockets. So if it's a fight that you want, it's a fight that you're going to get.

Is that why you can't admit that we are really good together, that you still love me? ", "Jack: No, because I don't still love you. And I really don't think that you love me. I think you're more in love with the idea of what we used to have. ", "Livvie: God, why are you doing this to me, Jack? Why are you doing this? You were always there for me. ", "Jack: You're right.
