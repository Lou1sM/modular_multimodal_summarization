She told you that you would never be able to find her,that she made sure of that.", "Lucy: Don't you think I know that letter by heart? I know every word in thatletter!", "Kevin: I know -- I know this is hard, Lucy, but there's no way that Juliewould ever bring Christina anywhere near port Charles or you.", "Lucy: But that was -- that was her little voice. I know her voice. That washer voice on the phone.", "Kevin: Someone's playing you. Come on. Come on. You've got good hunches,Lucy. Listen to them. It was your hunches that told us that there was somethingout there, something that is out there trying to do us all in. That's all thisis. It's an illusion.", "Lucy: Could -- could I get something to drink or something? I'm not doing toogood. Just -- anything?", "Kevin: You going to be ok here alone?", "Lucy: Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry, I won't run after any more littlegirls in red sweaters and scare their moms half to death. I'll be fine. I justneed to sit here for a minute, ok?", "Kevin: Ok. I'll be right back.", "Lucy: Ok.", "Lucy: Ok, universe, you know me very well and you know I have that light ofhope in my heart still every day for Christina, so what are you doing? Is thisall real or is this some sort of sick cosmic joke you're playing on me? Youknow, I'm getting really tired. They're wearing thin on me. So could you pleasejust give me a sign, you know, that this might be real. I mean, anything. I'lltake a sound of the wind. Anything, just a -- a sign, please.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Girl giggles]", "Eve: I should have never let him out of my sight. What kind of a mother losesher child? There's no messages.

Don't tell anyone.", "Eve: Please, just let me know where you are and please don't hurt my baby. I-- I will meet you. I'll meet you there. Where are you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Jamal doesn't even have a picture of me in his wallet.", "Jack: Hey --", "Alison: But he's got one of Valerie\u2019s kids?", "Jack: Calm -- calm down. All right, there's probably a perfectly goodexplanation.", "Alison: Yeah, like it's his kid!", "Jack: If it were Jamal\u2019s kid, he would have told you.", "Alison: But what if Valerie is setting some sort of a trap and Jamal doesn'teven know? You know, she's giving him pictures, you know, and totally talkingabout the kid, really reeling him in so he's ready to accept the big news thatshe's got. What if that was her plan all along?", "Jack: Or how about this -- you're putting yourself through hell for noreason.", "Alison: Jack, I checked. The math adds up. Ok, I need to know once and forall if Jamal is hope's father.", "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa.", "Alison: What?", "Jack: Hold on.", "Alison: What? What?", "Jack: Sit down. Come on. You are asking for a lot of trouble. Alison, look,if you open that box, whatever you find, you can't put back in there.", "Alison: Well, whatever I find is going to be better than a these questions.So will you help me?", "Jack: Help you?

Will you help me?", "Jack: Oh, gosh. I don't have a good feeling about this. But I'm -- I\u2019m notgoing to let you face this alone.", "Alison: Thank you. Livvie was such a jerk to ever let you go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Girl giggles]", "Lucy: Ok. Ok, what is this? Is it a sign? Is it -- is it a sign or -- or justsome trick? It's just a -- just a trick.
