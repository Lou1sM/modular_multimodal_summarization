        "Chris: Not so fast, Dr. Wexler. I've been trying to reach you for days.",
        "Karen: Is that all? It feels like I've been trying to avoid you for weeks.",
        "Chris: Take a look at this. No one else has your particular expertise in this\r\narea.",
        "Karen: These numbers -- what is this? I've never seen anything like it.",
        "Chris: It's blood work -- yours.",
        "Karen: Mine? But the levels are insane.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I think it has something to do with the syringe full of serum\r\nmade from vampire blood.",
        "Karen: Serum or not, Chris, look --",
        "Chris: Yes, I\u2019ve been looking. If I didn't know any better, I'd swear that\r\nthese didn't come from a human being.",
        "Lucy: Christina, it's mommy. Christina? Christina?",
        "Kevin: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Oh! Doc, it's Christina -- she's here!",
        "Kevin: Where?",
        "Lucy: There! Doc, I\u2019ve got to go after her!",
        "Eve: You did it. You tried to kidnap our son.",
        "Ian: What -- what are you talking about? I was with you.",
        "Eve: To distract me. You hired somebody to help.",
        "Ian: Stop right here. You're not making any sense, woman.",
        "Eve: Oh, I'm not making any sense. Yeah, it's always me not making any sense.",
        "Ian: For god's sake.",
        "Eve: You've got the baby's things packed. You have two plane tickets.",
        "Ian: They're not mine. Someone's trying to set me up. Why can't you see that?",
        "Eve: Oh, poor dr. Thornhart, always trying to set you up.",
        "Ian: Let me explain something to you.",
        "Eve: No. This time you are trying to set me up, and I won't let it happen.",
        "Ian: Listen to me.",
        "Eve: No. You distracted me long enough in the park to have my baby taken, but\r\nit won't happen again. I have proof. I caught you red-handed trying to kidnap my\r\nson.",

        "Chris: Cravings -- have",
        "Karen: You mean for stealing blood bags out of the E.R.? No.",
        "Chris: Ok. Good. Sex. Has your libido been --",
        "Karen: Unusually strong. Yeah.",
        "Chris: Really?",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Chris: How strong?",
        "Karen: Well, how graphic do you want me to be? I can't keep my hands off of\r\nfrank. I want it all the time.",
        "Chris: Really?",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Chris: Ok.",
        "Karen: And this -- this doesn't bother me. As a matter of fact, I like it\r\neven better with an audience.",
        "Chris: How romantic.",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm. In the e.R. When somebody's working on a patient just this far\r\naway.",
        "Chris: Yeah? Karen? Hey -- hey, wait.",
        "Karen: Mmm -- just thinking about it --",
        "Chris: What is that? That --",
        "Karen: You mean this?",
        "Chris: Yeah. No, no. No, it's -- it's a fragrance. It's a scent. Karen?",
        "Karen: Yeah?",
        "Chris: Whatever you're wearing, it's making me feel like --",
        "Karen: Feel what? Chris, why are you looking at me that way? Oh, come on. Now\r\nyou're teasing me. Chris. Hey, what's come over you?",
        "Lucy: Doc -- anything?",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I've looked everywhere.",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. She couldn't have just disappeared. She looked right at me.",
        "Kevin: Lucy, maybe this is just --",
        "Lucy: No, no. No, no. It's not just anything. It's her. I saw her, and she\r\nlooked at me, and -- doc, I looked right in her eyes, and I could tell she knew\r\nit was me. You -- you do believe me, right? You do?",
        "Kevin: I believe you believe.",
        "Lucy: What? Wait a minute --",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I believe that you saw her, but that doesn't mean that she was\r\nactually here. I mean, look where we are. This is almost the exact spot where\r\nshe was kidnapped. I don't know. Maybe -- maybe her energy is here or her aura\r\nor something.",
        "Lucy: No, no! This is not -- it is not an illusion.",
        "Kevin: Well, then, maybe it's connected to what -- what we've been talking\r\nabout -- that there's some evil force out there somewhere.",
        "Lucy: No, no, it's not an evil force. It's not magic. It's not all in my\r\nhead. Listen, if it was -- just say it was all in my head -- why would this be\r\nhappening right now?",
        "Kevin: I don't know! I don't know! Fine, then maybe -- maybe it's --",
        "Lucy: Maybe it's what? What?",
        "Kevin: Eve?",
        "Lucy: Oh, my god. How can you -- I just saw my daughter, and you're standing\r\nthere saying it's all because I\u2019m jealous of eve's baby?",
        "Kevin: Calm down, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: No, I have seen her! I've seen Christina twice. I talked to her. I\r\nheard her voice on the phone!",
        "Kevin: But you're the only one, Lucy. You're the only one that's seen her or\r\nheard her. Just you. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: So am I. I don't want your help. I want you to leave me alone.",
        "Kevin: I'm not going to leave you alone out here.",
        "Lucy: Yes, you are! I want you -- you know, you have a daughter. You have a\r\nreal, live, flesh and blood daughter. Why don't you go find her and help her\r\nbecause I don't want your help! Do you hear me? How many times do I have to say\r\nit?",
        "Kevin: Oh, you only have to say it once, believe me. I heard you loud and\r\nclear.",
        "Lucy: Good!",
        "Kevin: Fine.",
        "Lucy: Fine! I'm going to find her myself anyway. I don't need your help.\r\nChristina. Oh, Christina, mommy's coming. Mommy is going to find you. I will.",
        "Ian: Bellboy's on his way. He's going to prove that I\u2019m not behind this.",
        "Eve: We'll see.",
        "Ian: \"We'll see\"? Is it easier for you to believe that I would\r\nkidnap my own son?",
        "Eve: What do you expect? Look at all the evidence.",
        "Ian: Maybe this is time for you to believe in me. Think about why you're\r\nhere. You got the same phone call I did. You know why? So you'd walk through\r\nthis door and you'd see me holding the child. That's what they want -- me\r\nlooking like --",
        "Eve: Who's \"they\"?",
        "Ian: \"They.\" The same people who are sending notes to Kevin. The\r\nsame \"they\" that have a woman running around town pretending to be\r\nAnne Marie. \"They.\"",
        "Eve: I don't know if I should believe you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ian: Hang on.",
        "Bellboy: Dr. Thornhart.",
        "Ian: Who ordered those tickets?",
        "Bellboy: You did. One for you and one for the baby, just like you told me.",
        "Ian: Like I told you?",
        "Bellboy: Yeah, when you called down and had me charge them to your room.",
        "Ian: Who are you working for?",
        "Bellboy: Whoa, easy, easy, easy.",
        "Eve: Stop it. Take your hands off of him, Ian. Ian.",
        "Bellboy: Hey. I'm out of here, man.",
        "Eve: I've had it.",
        "Ian: Eve, he's working for them. He's just part of the whole thing.",
        "Eve: Oh. Now it all makes sense -- everything that you've done.",
        "Ian: Everything I\u2019ve done?",
        "Eve: You tricked me into tearing up that restraining order to get me to trust\r\nyou again so that I would turn my back on the baby. You did that deliberately!",
        "Ian: I -- I\u2019ve --",
        "Eve: I would never, never have taken my eyes off of Danny in a public place,\r\nespecially after what happened with Caleb. This was all just a part of yr plan.",
        "Ian: My plan?",
        "Eve: Yes! And then you wanted me to go to the loft by myself. You wouldn't\r\ncome with me. Everything that Kevin and everybody else said about you is true.",
        "Ian: Oh",
        "Eve: You can't be trusted.",
        "Ian: Yeah. The powerful Kevin Collins -- of course, he knows the truth about\r\neverything, regardless of what he feels about you. Fine. Can I ask you -- how\r\nabout putting a little faith in your present husband? Where are you going?",
        "Eve: I'm leaving, and don't try and stop me.",
        "Ian: I've -- fine. Fine. I'm -- listen, eve, I -- what are you going to do,\r\nput another restraining order on me? Is that what you're going to do?",
        "Eve: I might. I might do that. And I'll press charges, too.",
        "Ian: Ok.",
        "Eve: Now get out of my way. Let me go. Ian, let me go.",
        "Eve: It's ok, Danny.",
        "Ian: I'm not giving up.",
        "Karen: Chris? Anyone in there? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Ok, you got me. We're\r\neven. I started. I flirted first.",
        "Chris: No, no, no. Don't -- don't go.",
        "Karen: What's wrong with you?",
        "Chris: Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just worried about you.",
        "Karen: I know what this is really all about.",
        "Chris: You do?",
        "Karen: Mm-hmm. You are trying to figure out why your serum mutated in me,\r\nright?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Karen: So you can re-create the original compound and take it yourself\r\nsafely.",
        "Chris: No, no. Karen, that's not it.",
        "Karen: No, hell, Chris. I already told you I wouldn\u2019t be your guinea pig.",
        "Chris: Karen, listen to me. I -- I swear to you that's not what this is about\r\nat all.",
        "Karen: Oh, so what is it about, Chris?",
        "Chris: Well, I just believe that there could honestly come a time when you\r\nreally need me.",
        "Karen: What for? If I crash, I can take care of myself.",
        "Chris: Yeah, and you know what they say about doctors who do.",
        "Karen: They have a fool for a patient.",
        "Chris: Right. So I think, you know, you should let me watch over you, make\r\nsure you're all right. You need to take it easy anyway.",
        "Karen: Maybe you're right. Maybe I should take it easy.",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Karen: Thanks, Chris. You just gave me a great idea.",
        "Chris: Where are you going?",
        "Karen: I am going to take your advice. I'm going to go on a little impromptu\r\nvacation with frank.",
        "Chris: Frank?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Kevin: Well, Lucy, if you've come to apologize, I\u2019m not going to make it --\r\neve.",
        "Eve: Hi. It's me again.",
        "Kevin: Come on in.",
        "Eve: He went too far this time, Kevin. I had to get away, and I had to take\r\nDanny away.",
        "Kevin: All right, just slow down.",
        "Eve: He tried to kidnap my son.",
        "Kevin: He what?",
        "Eve: He got me to trust him again so that I would tear up the restraining\r\norder.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Just go back, tell me everything one step at a time.",
        "Eve: I am -- I'm trying to tell you everything --",
        "Kevin: All right -- look, I know you're upset. So am I. Over something Lucy\r\ndid. But, frankly's making me start to think that there's more to this.",
        "Eve: More to this? Like what?",
        "Kevin: Sit down. Eve, I\u2019m actually starting to think that there's -- that\r\nthere actually is some dark, active force out there somewhere.",
        "Eve: No. No. No. Caleb is gone, Kevin. This has nothing to do with some\r\nsupernatural threat that Lucy keeps talking about. You were right about Ian all\r\nalong. He's lying. He's manipulative.",
        "Kevin: Eve, eve --",
        "Eve: He's dangerous.",
        "Kevin: Eve, calm down.",
        "Eve: He got me to meet him in the park with Danny. And he got me to turn my\r\nback on Danny just long enough for someone to take him.",
        "Kevin: Well, what about Ian?",
        "Eve: Ian pretended to be just as upset as I was while all this was happening.\r\nAnd then I got this phone call from someone saying, \"I know where the baby\r\nis.\"",
        "Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. One thing at a time, please. Do you have any idea\r\nwho made the call?",
        "Eve: The voice was distorted, but it sounded like it could've been a woman.\r\nIn fact, I think it was probably Anne Marie. Everything she warned us about Ian\r\nis coming true.",
        "Kevin: But you're not sure that Anne Marie made the call.",
        "Eve: No. But I am sure about Ian. That's the sad part. I went into the hotel\r\nroom, and there was Ian with Danny in his arms and two plane tickets out of the\r\ncountry. He was this close to running away with my son. If I hadn't gotten there\r\nin time --",
        "Kevin: Oh, god --",
        "Eve: When I did, he would've taken my baby.",
        "Kevin: It's all right.",
        "Eve: He might've been taking my baby, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: You're safe now. Now we know who's behind all this trouble, and I know\r\nexactly what to do about it. There is no way that I\u2019ll let Ian near you or\r\nyour baby again.",
        "Ian: Lucy. Are you all right? What are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: I -- I saw her. I saw -- I saw Christina.",
        "Ian: You saw her here in the park?",
        "Lucy: Here in the park. I saw -- I swear I saw her, and then she just\r\nmysteriously disappeared. And the police are looking for her and Scott\u2019s got\r\nall of his men looking for him, but --",
        "Ian: Nothing, right?",
        "Lucy: Nothing.",
        "Ian: It's very strange -- two kids in the same park the same day.",
        "Lucy: What are you talking about, two kids in the park?",
        "Ian: Daniel was kidnapped here earlier.",
        "Lucy: My god, Ian --",
        "Ian: No, no, no, he's fine. He's back home. Everything's ok. But I'm the main\r\nsuspect all of a sudden.",
        "Lucy: I'm not getting this. You're the main suspect? How is that possible?",
        "Ian: Someone's trying to set me up. I don't know who, but I'm -- I thought\r\nI'd come back here and look for clues.",
        "Lucy: What does eve say about all this?",
        "Ian: She says whatever Kevin tells her to say.",
        "Lucy: Listen, I am really sorry about that.",
        "Ian: Yeah. It's been one accusation after another. I don't know this woman\r\nthat's running around town pretending to be Anne Marie. And, no, I did not\r\nkidnap eve. And I also -- I did not kidnap my own son. But my wife doesn't\r\nbelieve me.",
        "Lucy: Hey -- for what it's worth, I believe you. You know, I mean, I just\r\nknow what it's like when you have somebody that you're -- that person's supposed\r\nto love you and supposed to trust you, but who --",
        "Ian: Doesn\u2019t. So Kevin doesn't believe you, either? So much for soul mates,\r\nhuh? Can I ask you something?",
        "Lucy: Please.",
        "Ian: How can he look in your eyes and tell you that what you saw was real?",
        "Lucy: Thanks. I think you believe me, and it's a really good feeling to have\r\nsomeone who actually does and doesn't think I'm crazy.",
        "Ian: Ok, so here we are -- I believe you, you believe me, and the two people\r\nwho are supposed to matter most in our worlds don't have any faith in us at all.",
        "Lucy: Sounds awful. Maybe we could take it as a sign. I mean, maybe it's a\r\nsign from the universe that we are just supposed to stop worrying about what eve\r\nand Kevin think for a while and maybe 're supposed to start helping each other\r\ninstead.",
        "Karen: That's it. Another 30-something-hour shift is over. Now off for my\r\nfun-filled vacation --",
        "Karen: Chris.",
        "Chris: Karen. Ever since you were injected with serum, something's different.\r\nSomething's changed.",
        "Karen: You made it happen. You pumped me full of strength, life.",
        "Chris: Yeah. I've never thought of you this way before.",
        "Karen: Don't think. Make love to me, Chris. What are you going to do?",
        "Ian: I thought I'd help you.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. I appreciate that. But Danny and eve -- what are you going\r\nto do? Because I don't think eve's going to let you anywhere near that",
        "Ian: I never thought I'd say this, but I don't really care what eve wants\r\nright now. If she thinks that I\u2019m a kidnapper, then --",
        "Lucy: I know. Don't say it. Danny is even more at risk.",
        "Ian: She can't ignore the fact that there's someone out there trying to\r\ndestroy our family. Well -- he's not safe with her.",
        "Lucy: I hate to say it, but you're right. And I also hate to say, but I --",
        "Ian: I know. I know. God knows I didn't take the boy away before, but I will\r\nnow. I got to keep him safe.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Mac's called off the search for Daniel, and he's sending a few of\r\nhis men over to talk to Ian.",
        "Eve: I can't believe it. I'm siccing the cops on my own husband. I heard you\r\nask Mac about Christina. Is there a new lead?",
        "Kevin: Well, if you believe Lucy, there is. She thinks she saw Christina in\r\nthe park and at the hotel and who knows where else by now.",
        "Eve: If you want to go talk to her, go right ahead. You know Danny and I will\r\nbe just fine here by ourselves.",
        "Kevin: I'm the last person Lucy wants to see right now. I think I'm better\r\noff just giving her some time.",
        "Eve: Some time.",
        "Kevin: What is it?",
        "Eve: I think my time's up.",
        "Kevin: For?",
        "Eve: Wavering. There is no question in my mind that Ian is a very dangerous,\r\nsick man. And in order to protect Danny, I have to do something I never thought\r\nI would do.",
        "Kevin: Which is?",
        "Eve: I have to get a divorce.",
