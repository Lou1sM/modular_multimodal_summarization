Wait a minute --", "Kevin: Lucy, I believe that you saw her, but that doesn't mean that she wasactually here. I mean, look where we are. This is almost the exact spot whereshe was kidnapped. I don't know. Maybe -- maybe her energy is here or her auraor something.", "Lucy: No, no! This is not -- it is not an illusion.", "Kevin: Well, then, maybe it's connected to what -- what we've been talkingabout -- that there's some evil force out there somewhere.", "Lucy: No, no, it's not an evil force.

Look at all the evidence.", "Ian: Maybe this is time for you to believe in me. Think about why you'rehere. You got the same phone call I did. You know why?

Now it all makes sense -- everything that you've done.", "Ian: Everything I\u2019ve done?", "Eve: You tricked me into tearing up that restraining order to get me to trustyou again so that I would turn my back on the baby. You did that deliberately!", "Ian: I -- I\u2019ve --", "Eve: I would never, never have taken my eyes off of Danny in a public place,especially after what happened with Caleb. This was all just a part of yr plan.", "Ian: My plan?", "Eve: Yes! And then you wanted me to go to the loft by myself. You wouldn'tcome with me. Everything that Kevin and everybody else said about you is true.", "Ian: Oh", "Eve: You can't be trusted.", "Ian: Yeah.

I'm just worried about you.", "Karen: I know what this is really all about.", "Chris: You do?", "Karen: Mm-hmm. You are trying to figure out why your serum mutated in me,right?", "Chris: Yeah.", "Karen: So you can re-create the original compound and take it yourselfsafely.", "Chris: No, no. Karen, that's not it.", "Karen: No, hell, Chris. I already told you I wouldn\u2019t be your guinea pig.", "Chris: Karen, listen to me.

If I crash, I can take care of myself.", "Chris: Yeah, and you know what they say about doctors who do.", "Karen: They have a fool for a patient.", "Chris: Right.

Just go back, tell me everything one step at a time.", "Eve: I am -- I'm trying to tell you everything --", "Kevin: All right -- look, I know you're upset. So am I. Over something Lucydid. But, frankly's making me start to think that there's more to this.", "Eve: More to this? Like what?", "Kevin: Sit down. Eve, I\u2019m actually starting to think that there's -- thatthere actually is some dark, active force out there somewhere.", "Eve: No. No. No. Caleb is gone, Kevin. This has nothing to do with somesupernatural threat that Lucy keeps talking about. You were right about Ian allalong. He's lying. He's manipulative.", "Kevin: Eve, eve --", "Eve: He's dangerous.", "Kevin: Eve, calm down.", "Eve: He got me to meet him in the park with Danny. And he got me to turn myback on Danny just long enough for someone to take him.", "Kevin: Well, what about Ian?", "Eve: Ian pretended to be just as upset as I was while all this was happening.And then I got this phone call from someone saying, \"I know where the babyis.\"", "Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. One thing at a time, please. Do you have any ideawho made the call?", "Eve: The voice was distorted, but it sounded like it could've been a woman.In fact, I think it was probably Anne Marie. Everything she warned us about Ianis coming true.", "Kevin: But you're not sure that Anne Marie made the call.", "Eve: No. But I am sure about Ian. That's the sad part. I went into the hotelroom, and there was Ian with Danny in his arms and two plane tickets out of thecountry. He was this close to running away with my son. If I hadn't gotten therein time --", "Kevin: Oh, god --", "Eve: When I did, he would've taken my baby.", "Kevin: It's all right.", "Eve: He might've been taking my baby, Kevin.", "Kevin: You're safe now. Now we know who's behind all this trouble, and I knowexactly what to do about it. There is no way that I\u2019ll let Ian near you oryour baby again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Lucy. Are you all right? What are you doing here?", "Lucy: I -- I saw her. I saw -- I saw Christina.", "Ian: You saw her here in the park?", "Lucy: Here in the park. I saw -- I swear I saw her, and then she justmysteriously disappeared. And the police are looking for her and Scott\u2019s gotall of his men looking for him, but --", "Ian: Nothing, right?", "Lucy: Nothing.", "Ian: It's very strange -- two kids in the same park the same day.", "Lucy: What are you talking about, two kids in the park?", "Ian: Daniel was kidnapped here earlier.", "Lucy: My god, Ian --", "Ian: No, no, no, he's fine. He's back home. Everything's ok. But I'm the mainsuspect all of a sudden.", "Lucy: I'm not getting this. You're the main suspect? How is that possible?", "Ian: Someone's trying to set me up. I don't know who, but I'm -- I thoughtI'd come back here and look for clues.", "Lucy: What does eve say about all this?", "Ian: She says whatever Kevin tells her to say.", "Lucy: Listen, I am really sorry about that.", "Ian: Yeah. It's been one accusation after another. I don't know this womanthat's running around town pretending to be Anne Marie. And, no, I did notkidnap eve. And I also -- I did not kidnap my own son. But my wife doesn'tbelieve me.", "Lucy: Hey -- for what it's worth, I believe you. You know, I mean, I justknow what it's like when you have somebody that you're -- that person's supposedto love you and supposed to trust you, but who --", "Ian: Doesn\u2019t. So Kevin doesn't believe you, either? So much for soul mates,huh? Can I ask you something?", "Lucy: Please.", "Ian: How can he look in your eyes and tell you that what you saw was real?", "Lucy: Thanks. I think you believe me, and it's a really good feeling to havesomeone who actually does and doesn't think I'm crazy.", "Ian: Ok, so here we are -- I believe you, you believe me, and the two peoplewho are supposed to matter most in our worlds don't have any faith in us at all.", "Lucy: Sounds awful. Maybe we could take it as a sign. I mean, maybe it's asign from the universe that we are just supposed to stop worrying about what eveand Kevin think for a while and maybe 're supposed to start helping each otherinstead.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Karen: That's it. Another 30-something-hour shift is over. Now off for myfun-filled vacation --", "Karen: Chris.", "Chris: Karen. Ever since you were injected with serum, something's different.Something's changed.", "Karen: You made it happen. You pumped me full of strength, life.", "Chris: Yeah. I've never thought of you this way before.", "Karen: Don't think. Make love to me, Chris. What are you going to do?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: I thought I'd help you.", "Lucy: Thank you. I appreciate that. But Danny and eve -- what are you goingto do? Because I don't think eve's going to let you anywhere near that", "Ian: I never thought I'd say this, but I don't really care what eve wantsright now. If she thinks that I\u2019m a kidnapper, then --", "Lucy: I know. Don't say it. Danny is even more at risk.", "Ian: She can't ignore the fact that there's someone out there trying todestroy our family. Well -- he's not safe with her.", "Lucy: I hate to say it, but you're right. And I also hate to say, but I --", "Ian: I know. I know. God knows I didn't take the boy away before, but I willnow. I got to keep him safe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Ok. Mac's called off the search for Daniel, and he's sending a few ofhis men over to talk to Ian.", "Eve: I can't believe it. I'm siccing the cops on my own husband. I heard youask Mac about Christina. Is there a new lead?", "Kevin: Well, if you believe Lucy, there is. She thinks she saw Christina inthe park and at the hotel and who knows where else by now.", "Eve: If you want to go talk to her, go right ahead. You know Danny and I willbe just fine here by ourselves.", "Kevin: I'm the last person Lucy wants to see right now. I think I'm betteroff just giving her some time.", "Eve: Some time.", "Kevin: What is it?", "Eve: I think my time's up.", "Kevin: For?", "Eve: Wavering. There is no question in my mind that Ian is a very dangerous,sick man. And in order to protect Danny, I have to do something I never thoughtI would do.", "Kevin: Which is?", "Eve: I have to get a divorce.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", ">> Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"port Charles:Tempted.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", ">> On the next \"port Charles\" --", "Karen: Are you ready for the vacation of your life?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Oh, you bet, I am.
