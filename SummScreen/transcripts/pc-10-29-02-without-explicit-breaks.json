        "Livvie: Get him off me! Get this zombie off of me. ",
        "Lucy: Brennan's awake. ",
        "Ian: Don't try and talk. It's ok. Ok, I've got to check a few things out. ",
        "Lucy: I -- ",
        "Ian: Go see Livvie. It's all right. It's ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I'll be back. Livvie -- ",
        "Livvie: Did you see that? He came after me, and he wouldn't let me go. ",
        "Lucy: No, I think he was more afraid than you were. He's -- ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no, that's not what this is about. No. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, what is this about? ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, they're punishing me. ",
        "Lucy: What? Who? Who is punishing you? ",
        "Livvie: Look, I don't know who's behind this, but all I know is that I\u2019m being punished for losing my baby. ",
        "Lucy: No, it wasn't your fault. No one's blaming you. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God! Don't you understand? They want to hurt me because they think I killed my baby. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie \u2013 ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Ian: I don't know how to explain this, but your vitals are very good. ",
        "Brennan: Who are you? What am I doing here? ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: Do you need a ride? ",
        "[Tess hums] ",
        "Stephen: Hey. That's my song. Did you know that? I'm not going to hurt you. Just offering you a ride. These roads -- they're not safe to be walking on alone. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? ",
        "Tess: You know me? ",
        "Jack: Tess! Tess! Tess, where are you? Tess! ",
        "Tess: Jack. He's coming for me. ",

        "Deniece: Anything else, doctor? ",
        "Ian: That's it, Deniece. Thank you. ",
        "Brennan: Please, tell me. Where am I? ",
        "Ian: General Hospital, Port Charles in New York. ",
        "Brennan: What am I doing here? ",
        "Ian: It's a pretty long story. ",
        "Kate: So, looks like a harvest moon, Brennan. Remember how you used to love to sit in front of the fire after a harvest moon? ",
        "Ian: Kate, I got to talk to you. ",
        "Kate: Ian -- what is it? Did something happen to Brennan? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, something happened. ",
        "Kate: He's dead, isn't he? ",
        "Ian: No -- ",
        "Kate: Ian, tell me. Just tell me what happened. ",
        "Brennan: Hi, Katie. ",
        "Kate: Brennan? Oh, my God! Brennan!",
        "Brennan: It's been a long time since I kissed my best girl under a harvest moon. ",
        "Kate: Oh, my -- I can't believe it. Oh, my God. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: Why don't we get you right back into bed, ok? ",
        "Livvie: Just leave me alone, Lucy. I'm fine, ok? ",
        "Lucy: No, here. No, I think this whole thing has really knocked you for a loop, hasn't it? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. I'm in bed. I think you can leave now. ",
        "Lucy: What were you just saying just now? You were talking about some sort of strangers or somebody wanting to punish you for killing your baby. Who's \"they\"? ",
        "Livvie: I don't remember saying anything like that. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, you said someone wanted to punish you. Who? ",
        "Livvie: I was talking about you, Lucy, ok? Just having you in my room feels pretty punishing enough. Now, can you please go? ",
        "Lucy: No, because you're shaking and you're really pale and I really -- I want to help. ",
        "Livvie: Who do you think you're talking to? I know damn well you don't care about me or the baby I lost. ",
        "Lucy: That's really not true. ",
        "Livvie: My baby's dead, Lucy, so deal with it just like I had to. I mean, isn't that what everyone wanted? ",
        "Lucy: No, that is not -- nobody wanted any harm to come to you or your baby. ",
        "Livvie: Are you sure about that? You might want to check with the new freak in town. I mean, you might have seen her. She's usually attached to Jack's hip. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok, are we talking about this Tess person? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. You know she's sleeping with Jack, right? ",
        "Lucy: Why do you think she was sent somehow to hurt you? ",
        "Livvie: What would you think if your exact duplicate marched into town and right into Kevin\u2019s bed? ",
        "Lucy: You're not sure what's going on here. You're -- ",
        "Livvie: Of course, yeah. Of course. I suppose you would stick up for her. ",
        "Lucy: No, I am not sticking up for her. Livvie, come on, I\u2019m trying to make sense of all this. ",
        "Livvie: Sense? ",
        "Lucy: Yes. ",
        "Livvie: She was sent here to replace me. Can't you see that? ",
        "Lucy: No. What I see is just a girl who looks like you. ",
        "Livvie: Exactly like me. And she just sort of appeared out of nowhere, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok, calm down. I think what we have here is some sort of mystery, and I will help you. I'd like to help you solve it. ",
        "Livvie: And what are we going to do, some sort of cosmic detective work? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, maybe we will because that girl really is identical to you, and, you know, twins do run in Kevin\u2019s family. ",
        "Livvie: No, Lucy, there is no way that thing is my sister. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: Tess? That's your name? Tess. That's a lovely name. Nice to meet you, Tess. I'm Stephen. I'm glad you like my music. ",
        "Jack: Tess, where are you? ",
        "Stephen: Whoever's looking for you seems determined to find you. Are you running from something? From someone? I know you don't know me, Tess, but I can protect you. All you have to do is get in the car. ",
        "Jack: Tess? ",
        "Tess: That's Jack. I love Jack. ",
        "Jack: Tess! Tess, can you hear me? ",
        "Tess: Jack! ",
        "Jack: Tess. Tess. Hey, are you ok? Who was in that car? ",
        "Tess: A man. A nice man. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Colleen: Pretty amazing, isn't it? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, it certainly is. ",
        "Colleen: I've never seen anything like this happen before. ",
        "Ian: Doesn't happen very often, not to someone who's been in a coma for so long. ",
        "Colleen: Yeah. How did he come out of it? ",
        "Ian: I have no idea. All we can do now is make sure he doesn't relapse. Terry, do me a favor. I need a complete workup on Brennan -- blood, EEG, The whole thing. ",
        "Terry: Right away, doctor. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. ",
        "Colleen: If there's anything I can do, let me know. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Kate: What happened? What did you do? ",
        "Ian: I -- I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. ",
        "Kate: It's like a miracle. ",
        "Ian: It truly is. ",
        "Kate: So, what happens next? ",
        "Ian: We're running a battery of tests, and if they come back normal, we'll start rehab. ",
        "Kate: How can I ever thank you? ",
        "Ian: It's good to see you happy. ",
        "Kate: I'll never forget what you've done for Brennan, what you've done for me. I just hope that you can find happiness like this again someday. You're a good man, Ian. You deserve it. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: This Tess is not an \"it\" or a freak. She is a real person. ",
        "Livvie: No, you don't know that, Lucy. You don't know anything about her. ",
        "Lucy: I know I had her in my car. I gave her a ride to the hospital. I spent time with her. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, sure. And that makes you an expert. I am telling you there is something not right with her. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, but would it be so terrible if the two of you were related? ",
        "Livvie: No. I am not related to her, not in any way. No. ",
        "Lucy: But you're going to have to face it, Livvie. There's got to be some sort of weird connection because -- ",
        "Livvie: Not in this lifetime. Not in this lifetime. ",
        "Lucy: What are you doing? Why are you being so stubborn? Don't you want to know why she looks like you? ",
        "Livvie: I already know. She's some freak who had plastic surgery or something. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, that's -- did Rachel ever say anything to you? Maybe you have a sister. Did she tell you that? ",
        "Livvie: Don't you think I would remember something like that? ",
        "Lucy: Not necessarily, not if you wanted to block it out. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. The way I'm going to block you out right now. Lucy, can you please just leave my room? ",
        "Lucy: No, I can\u2019t. I need to help you find this out. Now, think about Rachel. She used to do those really strange, crazy experiments in the woods, remember? ",
        "Livvie: So what, she hid my twin sister in the middle of the woods? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know, but maybe it's possible. ",
        "Livvie: No, you're crazy. You are crazy. Tess, whoever, whatever, is not my sister. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, we can find this out. There's a way we can find this out. ",
        "Livvie: No, I don't have to prove anything. No. ",
        "Lucy: But we can use your DNA. We can get Tess back here, and I'll take your -- ",
        "Livvie: No. I don't want to be anywhere near her. I'm telling you, there's something dangerous about her, Lucy. Please, just get out of my room. Now, please! ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok. Ok. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: It's ok, Tess. Ok, I want to take you back to General Hospital, ok? ",
        "Tess: No. ",
        "Jack: No, listen to me. You're shaking. You're shaking, and I really think you ought to get checked out. ",
        "Tess: No. I don't want to go back. ",
        "Jack: Oh, hey, hey, it's ok. Everyone's seen you. We have nothing to hide. It's ok. ",
        "Tess: I'm afraid. ",
        "Jack: Hey. I am not going to let anyone hurt you. ",
        "Tess: Please, no. ",
        "Jack: Hey, is this about -- is this about Livvie? ",
        "Tess: Livvie -- ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- are you afraid of Livvie? ",
        "Tess: I'm afraid of Livvie. ",
        "Jack: Well, I'm not going to let Livvie come near you, ok? But I really need you to come back to the hospital with me. ",
        "Tess: No. Jack, I want to go home. The forest. ",
        "Jack: Well, we can't go back there. ",
        "Tess: Please, home. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, you know what, Tess? I'll compromise with you. We can go home, but why don't we go to my home. Come on, this way.",

        "Stephen\u2019s voice: We already have a drummer. ",
        "Marissa\u2019s voice: Then I guess we're through talking, aren't we? ",
        "Stephen\u2019s voice: He must be quite a lover. ",
        "Marissa\u2019s voice: Ricky is my friend and that's all, ok? But if it wasn't for him, then I wouldn't be in here, and so I owe him big. So it's either both of us or neither of us. You can pick. ",

        "Mick: Oh, I thought when Reese told me to come over that -- ",
        "Stephen: That I wanted you. Yes, well, it's a shame to have to disappoint you. I mean, you're going to have to go. ",
        "Mick: What? ",
        "Stephen: Let's just say the band is going in a different direction creatively, Mick, without you. ",
        "Mick: But I'm a really good drummer. And I've always been loyal to you, Stephen. ",
        "Stephen: You have been loyal, Mick. You have been loyal. But we both knew this day could come. But that's why I know you're going to do the right thing, and when you leave here -- when you leave here, no one's ever going to see you again, right? ",
        "Mick: I thought that -- ",

        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: How's Brennan doing? ",
        "Ian: He's -- he's awake. He's laughing with Kate. ",
        "Lucy: That is so incredible. It's about time we have some good news. How do you explain it? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. It's just your random, everyday miracle. And you look at these test results, it doesn't even look like the guy ever was in a coma. ",
        "Lucy: Wow. ",
        "Ian: Come on. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Brennan: I love you, Katie. ",
        "Kate: I can't believe I'm hearing you say those words to me. I have spent so many nights like this, sitting here waiting for you to come back to me. ",
        "Brennan: Seems like it was just yesterday we were together to me. ",
        "Kate: I was so afraid you wouldn't come back. I will never again take what we have for granted. I will cherish every single solitary moment we have together. ",
        "Kate: I love you so much. ",
        "Brennan: I know. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Ian: What about Livvie? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know about Livvie, but Livvie swears that there is just no way she could be related to Tess in any form, and she thinks that somehow Tess is here to punish her. ",
        "Ian: Punish her how? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. Something about people thinking that maybe she killed her baby. That whole thing was an accident, wasn't it? ",
        "Ian: As far as I know, yeah. What are you thinking? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know what I\u2019m thinking. I'm thinking that this whole thing is making me uneasy, and it's just adding to that whole feeling of strangeness. I keep telling you about that. Something is going on, and it's getting stronger every day. ",
        "Lucy: Well, except when you see something as wonderful as all that. ",
        "Ian: Makes you think anything is possible, doesn't it? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it does. ",
        "Ian: I've got to go to work. ",
        "Lucy: I think you should go to work. ",

        "Colleen: Yeah? ",
        "Ian: Did Jack Ramsey come in here a few days ago? ",
        "Colleen: Yeah, Chris had x-rays taken of his brother's leg. ",
        "Ian: Because Jack thought it was broken. ",
        "Colleen: Yeah, he thought so, but his x-rays showed that there had never been a break. ",
        "Ian: Let me have a look at those. ",
        "Colleen: Sure. I can do that right away. ",
        "Ian: First, Jack's leg, then Brennan. Who are you, Tess? What are you doing here? ",
