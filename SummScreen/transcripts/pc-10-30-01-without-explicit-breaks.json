        "Jack: So, this is it, huh?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, according to the court papers, this is where bill and\r\nCindy Hartman live -- the people that adopted hope.",
        "Jack: Ok, so, refresh my memory on the whole game plan.",
        "Alison: Well, I keep them talking --",
        "Jack: While I get a sample of the baby's hair.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Right.",
        "Jack: Oh, boy.",
        "Alison: Ok? Ok.",
        "Jack: I'm here.",
        "Alison: Anything to run this d.N.A. Test to see if -- find out if Jamal is\r\nthe father of Valerie\u2019s baby.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Ok?",
        "Jack: Remember, he's a doctor.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Man: Yes?",
        "Alison: Hi!",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Alison: Dr. Hartman. I'm Alison Barrington. And this is my friend, Jack\r\nRamsey. We're students at the university.",
        "Dr. Hartman: What can I do for you?",
        "Alison: Um -- well, we're doing a paper -- a research paper on --",
        "Jack: Doctors who adopt.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jack: And we wondering if we could sit down with you, ask you a few\r\nquestions.",
        "Alison: Yeah, about your daughter. You did adopt a girl, right?",
        "Dr. Hartman: What course did you say this was for again? Sociology 233, dr.\r\nGoldman?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Right, yeah. Dr. Goldman.",
        "Dr. Hartman: I thought so. No such professor, no such class. I can smell a\r\ncon a mile away.",
        "Alison: Listen -- I can explain.",
        "Dr. Hartman: Do that and do it quick before I call the cops. What are you two\r\nreally doing here, and what do you want?",
        "Jamal: All right, so I'll just make the bank deposit on Friday.",
        "Frank: Yeah? Great. Great. Thanks.",
        "Jamal: Cool.",
        "Frank: I think that's it, man. So, thanks again for covering for me.",
        "Jamal: Hey, no problem. Anytime.",
        "Valerie: Where are you going, frank?",
        "Frank: Well, Karen mentioned something about green lake. But she has been so\r\nspontaneous lately; I could end up in Istanbul.",
        "Jamal: Hey, hey, just enjoy the ride.",
        "Frank: Oh.",
        "Jamal: And speaking of enjoying the ride -- ahem.",
        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Karen: Hey, lover. So, are you ready for the vacation of your life?",
        "Frank: Oh, you bet I am. Bring it on.",
        "Rafe: Ok, boss. Now what? I mean, I thought I made a few points, showing\r\nthese guys a peek at the love they still got for each other, but they're farther\r\napart now than before. And I just think that's a little weird because, Caleb, he\r\ndoesn't have his full powers back yet. He doesn't have his fangs. He can't feed.\r\nBut their lives, they're just falling apart all around me. I mean, I just don't\r\nthink he can cause that much damage by himself. It's kind of like he's got\r\nsomeone helping him.",
        "Livvie: Rafe?",
        "Rafe: You know, like -- Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Who're you talking to?",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc.]",
        "Karen: More where that came from.",
        "Frank: Just let me grab my things.",
        "Karen: Get grabbing. Let's get going!",
        "Frank: All right.",
        "Karen: Sorry. Couldn't help myself.",
        "Frank: I'm looking forward to helping myself to some things, too, so just --\r\nhang on.",
        "Chris: Ah. Karen.",
        "Karen: Chris. I thought you'd be filling in for me all day.",
        "Chris: Oh, chief resident. Get to make the schedule, remember?",
        "Karen: Meaning you passed the shift off on to those two new interns.",
        "Chris: G.H. Tradition.",
        "Karen: We swore never to do it to anybody else, remember?",
        "Chris: Actually the only thing I do remember is how hungry I am for some\r\nlunch. Care to join me?",
        "Karen: Frank and I are leaving.",
        "Chris: Really? Where are you off to while I\u2019m slaving away for you?",
        "Karen: Hmm. Green Lake.",
        "Chris: green Lake. That's beautiful. I love it there. Which shore?",
        "Karen: I found this perfect cabin on -- I see where you're going.",
        "Chris: What do you mean, after lunch? Back to the hospital, land of\r\ndisinfectant?",
        "Karen: If you think I didn't see you drive by my apartment last night while I\r\nwas taking out the garbage, you're wrong. And I'll bet those two hang-up calls\r\nwere from you, too.",
        "Chris: Hang-ups? You had hang-ups?",
        "Karen: I know why you called, Chris, and why you're here. I know what you\r\nwant from me.",
        "Chris: You do?",
        "Karen: And the answer is yes.",
        "Valerie: Ah. Two ginger ales.",
        "Jamal: Coming right up.",
        "Valerie: Oh, it's been fun remembering old times, huh?",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Haven't thought about that party in years.",
        "Valerie: Yeah. Me, neither. We were pretty close friends once, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, that was a long time ago.",
        "Valerie: Yeah. Just because you're with Ali now doesn't mean that we can't be\r\nfriends again, does it?",
        "Jamal: No, but -- a lot has happened between now and then.",
        "Valerie: Yeah. So, tell me about it.",
        "Jamal: I am. I guess this whole friend thing -- better just take it slow, ok?",
        "Valerie: Sure. I understand. I guess.",
        "Jamal: Good. Two ginger ales.",
        "Valerie: Thanks. Hey -- do you still have that picture of hope I gave you?",
        "Jamal: In my wallet. You want it?",
        "Valerie: No, that's ok. Just -- you keep it. I've been thinking about old\r\ntimes, so -- just makes things seem simpler back then, you know? Fun.",
        "Jamal: You had hope.",
        "Valerie: I had so many dreams for my little girl. I wanted to give her the\r\nfamily that I never had.",
        "Jamal: Valerie, you did. Ok?",
        "Valerie: I know -- in my heart. But you don't understand what it's like,\r\ngiving your child away to another family to raise, to love.",
        "Dr. Hartman: Well, I'm still waiting on an explanation.",
        "Jack: Listen, doctor, we're really sorry --",
        "Woman: Honey, who is it?",
        "Dr. Hartman: Good question.",
        "Alison: Um -- ok. Look, we are not students from the university doing any\r\nsort of paper. We're here because --",
        "Jack: We know your baby.",
        "Alison: Yeah, hope.",
        "Jack: Hope.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: I don't understand.",
        "Alison: I just found out that my boyfriend may be the father. I'm sorry --\r\nthe biological father.",
        "Jack: Yeah. We promise we're not here to cause any trouble. We don't want to,\r\nlike --",
        "Alison: I just -- we just need to find out if Jamal is your little girl's --\r\nyou know -- and we can --",
        "Dr. Hartman: All right. I've heard enough.",
        "Jack: No, no, no. Wait, wait. Before you close the door in our faces, please.\r\nWe feel that this might be good for you to know if it's true or not.",
        "Dr. Hartman: Good for us?",
        "Jack: Yes, if Jamal is the father, then we feel like it could change hope's\r\nwhole --",
        "Alison: Like medical history.",
        "Jack: Medical history.",
        "Alison: You know?",
        "Jack: And we feel that's important for you and her.",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dr. Hartman: All right. What is it that you want from us?",
        "Alison: Anything. Hair, a sample of hope's d.N.A. That's all. To find out the\r\ntruth. Please, dr. And Mrs. Hartman, will you please help us?",
        "Rafe: How long you been standing there?",
        "Livvie: I haven\u2019t. I just got here. Why?",
        "Rafe: Oh, nothing. I just didn't know anyone was listening, that's all.",
        "Livvie: I wasn't. I just -- I heard you talking out loud, that's all. I\r\ndidn't hear a word you were saying.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I talk to myself sometimes.",
        "Livvie: Tell me about it.",
        "Rafe: So, what brings you out here?",
        "Livvie: I don't know. I'm just taking a walk.",
        "Rafe: Livvie, what is it?",
        "Livvie: Nothing. Really. I --",
        "Rafe: You know, sometimes it's easier to open up to somebody who you don't\r\nknow all that well. You know, you ever hear that?",
        "Livvie: What day is it?",
        "Rafe: What day? Tuesday?",
        "Livvie: I don't know how I got here, Rafe. I'm so scared. These big chunks of\r\ntime -- they're just missing, they're gone, and I don't know where I've been or\r\nwhat I've done. I can't remember. And it just -- it keeps happening more and\r\nmore.",
        "Rafe: Must be terrifying. What's the last thing you remember, Livvie?",
        "Livvie: Falling asleep in Jack's bed. But after that, everything's blank up\r\nuntil now.",
        "Rafe: Have you thought about asking for help?",
        "Livvie: No, Rafe, please, you have to promise me -- you cannot say anything!\r\nThey'll lock me up. They'll think I'm crazy like my mother.",
        "Rafe: Shh.",
        "Livvie: That's why I haven't said anything! I can't -- not to a doctor --",
        "Rafe: Shh! It's ok. Just relax, take it easy. All right? It's not your fault.\r\nYou're not crazy. Look at me, Livvie. The answers you're looking for are locked\r\naway deep inside you. Now, I can help if you want.",
        "Livvie: How?",
        "Rafe: Just think back. Try to remember.",
        "Livvie: No, I can\u2019t.",
        "Rafe: I know you're afraid. But I'm right here. You'll be all right. It's\r\nbetter to know, isn't it? These places inside you must feel dark and strange.",
        "Livvie: No, I don't think I can.",
        "Rafe: I have confidence in you. If you want to remember, you can. I know you\r\ncan.",
        "Caleb: She'll remember when I let her remember.",
        "Livvie: Caleb.",
        "Caleb: And not one heartbeat sooner.",
        "Dr. Hartman: What makes you think that this Jamal is our baby's father?",
        "Alison: Well, I found out hope's birthday, and I counted back on the calendar\r\nto the night that he and Valerie were together, and it's almost nine months to\r\nthe day.",
        "Dr. Hartman: Well, then, you have nothing to worry about. Our hope was born a\r\nmonth early. So, you see, all this skullduggery was for nothing. Your boyfriend\r\ncouldn't be hope's father.",
        "Alison: I don't -- I don't remember anyone at the hospital ever mentioning\r\nthat she was premature.",
        "Dr. Hartman: From what I understand, there was a time in Valerie\u2019s life\r\nwhen she had a lot more to worry about than whether her baby was born a bit\r\nearly or not.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: She was hiding from her boyfriend, wasn't she?",
        "Dr. Hartman: A very dangerous, very violent young man, from what we've heard.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. He was. I should know.",
        "Jack: Is there any chance you're wrong about hope being premature?",
        "Dr. Hartman: None.",
        "Jack: None. So then Jamal couldn't be the father. Alison --",
        "Alison: Yeah. I -- I understand. I'm sorry. Sorry to take all your time.",
        "Dr. Hartman: No problem. Over and done with.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Dr. Hartman: You two take care, now.",
        "Jack: All right. You, too.",
        "Alison: Ok.",
        "Jack: Thanks again.",
        "Dr. Hartman: All right.",
        "Jack: So we got what we needed, what we're looking for.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, my god. Thank god! Oh, you have no idea what a relief\r\nthat is.",
        "Jack: Well, let's put it this way -- I have a good idea.",
        "Alison: Oh, the nightmare's over. Jamal has no connections to hope\r\nwhatsoever. So that means that he and Valerie have no daughter together.",
        "Jamal: You know, Valerie, I know how hard it was for you to give up hope.",
        "Valerie: Yeah. I miss her all the time.",
        "Jamal: I could tell just from the picture how special she is.",
        "Valerie: You could?",
        "Jamal: Yeah. I mean, something about those eyes and that -- that big, old\r\nsmile she has going on. Oh, yeah. I mean, she's -- she's really special.",
        "Valerie: Yeah. That's what you said when you helped deliver her.",
        "Jamal: You know, in some ways, hope was the reason Ali and me got together.\r\nAll the time we spent helping you and Hope get away from Cedric and --",
        "Valerie: So where is she, anyway?",
        "Jamal: Who, Ali? She had something to do for her grandmother. I don't know.",
        "Valerie: Must be nice having money and a family -- something we wouldn't know\r\nabout, right?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, neither does she. Her parents are so busy in their lives\r\nthat they don't even take the time to check in with her.",
        "Valerie: Still, got a rich grandma.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but she won't take a dime from her. Ali turned her back on all\r\nthat when she got with me. And now I'm her family.",
        "Chris: Did -- did I just hear you right? I mean, did you just say that you --",
        "Karen: Yes.",
        "Chris: You said yes. Yes, I knew it. I knew you had to feel the same way I\r\ndo.",
        "Karen: I fought it at first, but you really got to me yesterday, Chris. And I\r\nhonestly feel the same way you do now. So, when do you want to start?",
        "Chris: Start? All right.",
        "Karen: Experimenting on me?",
        "Chris: Yeah, experimenting.",
        "Karen: Running regular blood tests, the whole series, top to bottom.",
        "Chris: Top to bottom.",
        "Karen: Yeah. To find out how my body's reacting to the vampire serum. That's\r\nwhat you wanted, right?",
        "Chris: Of course I do. You know, the sooner, the better. We need to -- need\r\nto get some answers.",
        "Karen: As soon as I get back.",
        "Chris: Fine. Fine. And -- and you realize we're going to have to spend quite\r\na bit of time together so I can cover all the bases.",
        "Karen: Yeah, I know.",
        "Chris: And that's ok with frank?",
        "Karen: What about frank?",
        "Chris: Well, does he know that you've been injected with the serum, that --\r\nwhat's going on with you?",
        "Karen: Uh-uh. And it's going to be our little secret, ok?",
        "Frank: What secret?",
        "Rafe: Caleb, what are you doing here?",
        "Caleb: Just looking after what belongs to me.",
        "Rafe: \"Belongs\"?",
        "Caleb: Mm-hmm. You see, I\u2019m saving souls, too, now. I'm saving them from\r\nyou and an eternity of boredom. Isn't that right, Olivia?",
        "Rafe: You don't have to listen to him, Livvie.",
        "Caleb: Oh, I'm sorry. Her soul is already spoken for, and she'll do whatever\r\nI ask.",
        "Rafe: Why don't you let her speak for herself, bat boy?",
        "Caleb: Go ahead, sweetheart. Tell our friend here why you'll always come back\r\nto me.",
        "Livvie: We'll be together forever. Caleb promised me happily ever after.",
        "Caleb: Because what kind of love do we have?",
        "Livvie: Never-ending love. The only kind that lasts.",
        "Rafe: Do you really believe that, Livvie?",
        "Livvie: Jack and the others will all wind up leaving me one day, but Caleb\r\nwill be with me forever. Their human love fades and his never will.",
        "Caleb: I am so proud of you, sweetheart.",
        "Rafe: So, you got the guts to stop pulling her strings for a second and let\r\nme talk to her, huh?",
        "Caleb: Be my guest. With or without me, she knows who she belongs with.",
        "Rafe: Look at me, Livvie.",
        "Caleb: Ah -- but don't tell her what to do. It isn't nice, and it's against\r\nyour rules.",
        "Rafe: Livvie, listen to me. I know about life, human life. I know how fragile\r\nit is.",
        "Caleb: So very, very short.",
        "Rafe: I also know there's only one thing that has the power to transcend both\r\ntime and death.",
        "Caleb: Taxes?",
        "Rafe: Love, Livvie. Human love. When it's real, it never dies.",
        "Caleb: She didn't just fall off the turnip truck, man. She has been let down\r\nher whole life. That is until we met.",
        "Rafe: Think about Jack -- how you met, how you fell in love, how he fought to\r\nsave your soul, even if it meant giving up his own. Think about that kind of\r\nlove. That's real.",
        "Caleb: Oh, please.",
        "Livvie: It used to feel so good.",
        "Rafe: That's it. Allow yourself to remember the good times before you were\r\nunder Caleb\u2019s shadow. Then maybe you'll start to remember other things.",
        "Livvie: I want to. I want to remember everything.",
        "Caleb: You're wasting your breath, Rafe, because the minute I leave, she\r\nwon't remember any of this.",
        "Rafe: Unless I can get her to remember all the stuff you're making her do.",
        "Livvie: \"Do\"?",
        "Rafe: And that you're not her real love at all but Jack is. Then you'll be\r\nlost to her forever.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: So, we're safe now? What if they find out about hope not being\r\nborn prematurely?",
        "Dr. Hartman: Don't worry.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: Are you sure?",
        "Dr. Hartman: We won't lose our little girl. Whatever it takes, we'll never\r\ngive her back.",
        "Jamal: Whoa. What's getting into you, girl?",
        "Alison: What? What, you complaining?",
        "Jamal: No way. I'm just wondering where this new habit of yours of jumping\r\ninto my arms whenever you see me is coming from lately.",
        "Alison: Well, I just love you so much. Do I need another reason?",
        "Jamal: No. No. I love you, too.",
        "Alison: Then why don't you show me? Huh?",
        "Frank: You guys going to tell me what's up, or do I have to start thinking\r\nthe worst?",
        "Karen: I was just telling Chris here where we're going on our vacation's a\r\nsecret, that's all. I mean, the last thing I want is for Mr. Chief resident here\r\nto think that he could bring me back early. Right?",
        "Chris: Absolutely.",
        "Karen: So no peep from G.H. I've got your word?",
        "Chris: Yes. Yes, you've got my word. Enjoy yourselves.",
        "Frank: So, what -- what's up with him, anyway? It's like he's glued to you.",
        "Karen: Are you jealous?",
        "Frank: Of Ramsey? Come on.",
        "Karen: Give the guy a break. I mean, his life's totally empty outside the\r\nhospital. He hangs around me because I\u2019m nice to him when nobody else is.",
        "Frank: Yeah, and why exactly are you suddenly being so nice to him?",
        "Karen: I guess I just feel sorry for him, that's all.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you know, I guess I've never really trusted him.",
        "Chris: Yeah, green lake. Have any cabins available up there?",
        "Caleb: You are playing a very dangerous game now, my friend.",
        "Rafe: Powers aren't as strong as you thought they were, huh?",
        "Caleb: I can show you exactly how powerful.",
        "Livvie: Help me, Rafe.",
        "Caleb: He can't.",
        "Rafe: But you can help yourself. It's within you.",
        "Caleb: I'm your destiny.",
        "Rafe: You know this man is evil. You helped destroy him once. You can do it\r\nagain.",
        "Caleb: You gave me life, Olivia. There is no greater love than that.",
        "Livvie: Yes.",
        "Rafe: No, Livvie, don't listen to him!",
        "Caleb: It was your desire, Olivia.",
        "Rafe: No. Livvie, look at me. We'll fight him together, ok? We'll bring him\r\ndown together. I'll tell you what's really happening here -- you -- no!",
        "Livvie: Rafe!",
        "Caleb: What, sweetheart?",
        "Livvie: Caleb, where did he go? What happened to him?",
        "Caleb: Oh, him. Well, he broke the rules.",
        "Livvie: Rules?",
        "Caleb: And you know you should never break the rules, right?",
        "Livvie: Never.",
        "Caleb: That's a good girl. You'll never remember any of this. You won't\r\nremember until it's too late.",

        ">> On the next \"port Charles\" --",
        "Eve: I can't believe I have to put him through this, too.",
        "Livvie: Why don't you leave him here with me?",
        "Man: You got to keep your eye on the ball. I think your friends' lives depend\r\non it.",
        "Eve: I won't let you get near Daniel.",
        "Ian: He's my son, and you're not keeping me away from him. Not now, not ever."
