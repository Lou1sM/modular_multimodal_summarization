Ian doeshave rights as Danny\u2019s father.", "Kevin: Well, then we'll make him understand the risks involved. We'll let himknow what Ian\u2019s been up to and that he tried to kidnap Danny. Look, it'll allcome out in the hearing.", "Eve: Never in my worst nightmare did I ever expect this to happen.", "Kevin: I know.", "Eve: Half the time I can't believe what I\u2019m seeing or hearing and that thisman --", "Kevin: The other half of the time you're scared, and you have every reason tobe. You're doing the right thing.", "Eve: All that matters is protecting Daniel. That's all I can think about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: I am so sorry, Eve. I can't believe what you've been going through.", "Kevin: Livvie. Did we wake you up? I'm sorry.", "Livvie: No, it's ok. I feel like all I've been doing is sleeping lately. Areyou guys off to the hearing now?", "Kevin: Yeah. I'm going to testify. But it's just an informal hearing. Weshouldn't be gone that long. You going to be ok?", "Livvie: Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, I don't know what Lucy or Jack's told you, butyou don't have to worry about me.", "Kevin: I don't mind.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: You know, Jack and I broke up. There's nothing more to say. It'sdefinitely nothing compared to what Eve's been dealing with.", "[Daniel cries]", "Eve: Ohh. Hi, sweetie. Oh, it's ok, buddy. Yes, it's ok. Mommy's here. Ican't believe I have to put him through this, too.", "Livvie: Then, eve --", "Eve: Oh, baby.", "Livvie: Why don't you leave him here with me? I mean, I'd be happy to takecare of him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: What's going on? Why'd you pull me out of there? I was getting throughto Livvie.", "Man: Getting through to her? That's what you call it, huh?", "Rafe: Yeah. Sir, look, I\u2019ve got it all figured out. Caleb is using Livvieto destroy everyone, right, only she doesn't know it yet, and I was this closeto helping her.", "Man: You were this close to telling her.", "Rafe: No. No, I was -- you know, I was guiding her.", "Man: Hmm.", "Rafe: I was helping her remember what she already knows, like you said.", "Man: mm-hmm. \"I'll help you fight him\"? \"I'll tell you what'sreally happening\"?", "Rafe: Yeah, so maybe I got a little carried away.", "Man: Mm-hmm, threw out the rules again.", "Rafe: Oh, man, do you see what he's doing with her? Livvie needs help andCaleb needs to know that he can't get away with this!", "Man: So you thought you'd send him a message, is that it?", "Rafe: Well, he was sweating it before you pulled me back here. Now he's justsitting down there thinking nobody can stop him.", "Man: You know something -- I really don't car-- I don't give a damn what hethinks. This isn't about you and Caleb. It's about helping these people withtheir lives, helping them fight for themselves and for each other, not doing itfor them. Otherwise, you're taking away their strength.", "Rafe: All right, so meanwhile, while I'm down there helping them do this, wejust let Caleb do whatever he pleases, is that it?", "Man: Why don't you concentrate on what you can do, the things you can do.Giving Caleb a conscience isn't one of them.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: Soon I\u2019ll have everything I deserve.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: You -- you are so right. I belong to you and always will. Thank youfor giving me another chance and letting me help you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: I brought you what is rightfully yours.", "Kevin: I just remembered, this will be an informal hearing. There will onlybe a judge and a court reporter.", "Eve: Is there anything I should do or expect?", "Kevin: Just tell the truth, why you don't want Ian near your son. This isn'tyour fault, Eve Ian\u2019s the one who forced the issue.", "Eve: I'm glad you're here, Kevin.", "Kevin: Lucy?", "Eve: I don't know what you're trying to do, but I won't let you get nearDaniel.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: That's where you're wrong. He's my son and you're not keeping me awayfrom him -- not now, not ever.\u00a0", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: Look, I get what you're saying, but I'm not making any progress. Everytime my cousin and her friends come close to finding each other again, Calebjust comes right in and blows them apart again.", "Man: There's always setbacks, kid. That's how it is in life. That's how it isnow.", "Rafe: Well, but there's more to this. I mean, they're further apart now thanever before.", "Man: You losing faith in them?", "Rafe: No. No, I'm just -- I'm stuck. You know, I thought giving them thatnight to dream would help remind them of what's really in their hearts and --", "Man: They haven't forgotten.", "Rafe: Why's it feel like they have?", "Man: Because it isn\u2019t that easy. One night of dreaming doesn't takeeverything away. Certainly not your problems or your fears or your doubts,certainly not evil. That battle's as old as time.", "Rafe: All right, so what are you saying? I just go out there and fight thegood fight and just throw my hat in the ring and see what happens -- what?", "Man: No, no, no. You give them as much as you can to fight with, and that'shope. Like you did with the dreams. Like you did with the girl you were workingwith for a while.", "Rafe: Livvie?", "Man: Yeah, Livvie. Reminding her that she's still got the love of her familyand her friends. That was good work, by the way.", "Rafe: Are you giving me a compliment?", "Man: Well, you went a little too far. You got to watch the impatience, kid.This is a marathon, not a sprint.", "Rafe: But, you know, Caleb\u2019s on his way back! There's people's lives atstake here!", "Man: Lives they have to save. So you focus on them, and would you please putaway your old human emotions someplace?", "Rafe: \"Old human emotions\"? What?", "Man: Look, kid, it's good that you care -- it really is good -- but itdisrupts you, it distracts you. You got to keep your eye on the ball. I thinkyour friends' lives depend on it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Why don't we let them talk.", "Kevin: I'm not leaving Eve alone with him.", "Eve: We'll be fine. Really, this is a courthouse, after all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: What the hell are you doing here?", "Lucy: I suppose I should ask you the same question.", "Kevin: I have to testify.", "Lucy: Oh. Well, so do I.", "Kevin: For Ian?", "Lucy: Yes, for Ian. Somebody needs to be in his corner, you know.", "Kevin: You're only making this worse, Lucy. Do you see that?", "Lucy: No, what I see is you stuck to your ex-wife like glue and turning Eveand Ian against each other. That's what I see. You are making it worse.", "Kevin: Eve's husband tried to take their baby.", "Lucy: That is not true. He was set up.", "Kevin: And you actually buy that? You of all people?", "Lucy: Yeah, I do. Oh. Oh. Is this because my daughter, Christina, waskidnapped, and so you think I\u2019d sympathize with a kidnapper? I don't think so.He is not a kidnapper, and so I do sympathize with him.", "Kevin: Does Ian know?", "Lucy: Yeah. Yes, I told him that I saw Christina. And you know what -- hetruly believes me.", "Kevin: So that's what this is about. He believes you, so you believe him.", "Lucy: No, this is not what it's about. It's about Ian. He's been a goodfriend. He's a good man and he is not capable of doing what you and eve areaccusing him of doing.", "Kevin: And it has nothing to do with Christina?", "Lucy: No. But it sure feels awfully good to have somebody support me insomething that is so important to me.", "Kevin: I want Christina back with you more than anyone and you know it, butScott\u2019s people have been everywhere and they can't find a single trace thatChristina was here ever", "Lucy: Fine.", "It's true, Lucy.", "Lucy: I know, ok? But right now that's not what matters. This is not about meor you or Christina. This is about eve and Ian and their baby, and you'remeddling. And if you keep doing this, if you and eve keep working together onthis, you take the chance of tearing their family apart forever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: I'm not the one who's doing this, Eve.", "Eve: I won't give you another chance to take Daniel. I can\u2019t.", "Ian: I -- I didn't kidnap Daniel. And I don't know who did, and I don't knowwhy they tried to make it look like I was going to take him outside the country.But I know this -- if we don't stick together here, whoever's behind this isgoing to succeed.", "Eve: I can't let my guard down now, not with Danny.", "Ian: I know, I know. But you're focusing on the wrong person. So let's figureout who's behind this the way we figure out everything else -- together. Let'sforget about this hearing and go home as a family -- you, me, and the boy -- soI can take care of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: I see you two have had a chance to talk. Is there a chance you'vesettled your differences?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: No, we haven't.", "Eve: Forgive me for taking so long and for ever denying this child belongs toyou.", "Caleb: Hmm. You're home, son. You're home.", "Eve: I'm so sorry. I should have known you were the one. You're so muchbetter than Michael. I should have picked you.", "Caleb: But I didn't pick you. Now, you've brought your child. You're of nouse to me anymore.", "Caleb: Would you like to hold our child, my love?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: Oh, please.", "[Daniel whimpers]", "Livvie: Mommy's here, Daniel. Mommy's here.", "[Daniel cries]", "Livvie: It's ok, baby, I'm here. Oh, there you go. Here's a toy. You are thesweetest little baby. Yes.", "Livvie: When was that? I remember holding you, but that was at eve's, not --shh, it's ok. No, I've never -- I've never been in the park with you. What am Iremembering?", "Eve: Did he tell you he was going to give you a child?", "Livvie: Yes. It was going to be our family.", "Eve: And it was going to be our son.", "Livvie: Why am I remembering this? What is happening to me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: And finally, though this isn't a formal court, my decision is binding.Now, I\u2019ve read the claims and counterclaims, and they're pretty ugly. I wouldlike to hear from the couple involved, in your own words, how you got here,starting with dr. Lambert.", "Eve: The reason I am keeping my son away from his father is because I came tofind out some things about his past.", "Ian: There's a woman telling lies about me, and my wife has chosen to believethem.", "Eve: A woman Ian worked with in Africa told me that he murdered her husbandand then tried to kill her.", "Ian: Anne-Marie died tragically. Whoever this woman is spreading lies is animpostor.", "Judge: Is this woman you've spoken of available to testify?", "Kevin: No. We can't find her because she's afraid of Ian.", "Ian: She's afraid of being exposed as a liar. Anne-Marie\u2019s dead.", "Judge: Is there a document or person who can confirm that?", "Ian: No, but we're trying to locate somebody.", "Eve: And then come to find out that Ian purchased two tickets to Europe --one for himself and one for my baby. Your honor, I'm afraid that if you let himsee my son, he'll take him away from me and I'll never see either one of themever again.", "Ian: Anyone could have ordered those tickets in my name. And I would nevertake Danny away from his mother, regardless of what my rights are as a father.", "Judge: I'm very disturbed by everything I've heard here today, but neither ofyou has given me anything that proves whose version of events is true, if any ofit is. Every incident or story comes down to a case of he said/she said.", "Ian: So that means there's no evidence of me being a risk to my son, whichmeans I should be allowed to see him.", "Eve: No, you can't let him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Judge: Ms. Coe, do you have anything to add that we haven't heard?", "Lucy: Um -- yeah, I wasn't going to, but, yes, I do. Your honor, you have tounderstand this whole thing. It sounds awful, but what it is is just a big,awful mess, that's what it is, and the saddest part of it is there's a littlebaby involved. You see, Ian loves his son very, very much, and eve loves Danny,too. And I hate to say this because eve is a wonderful mother. She's been verycaring and wonderful. She's very good with her little boy, but it's just latelythe way she's acting toward Ian -- it's too much. It's really become irrational.", "Judge: I need specifics, ms. Coe.", "Lucy: Um -- ok, I'll try. Eve, you have to admit you have been very, veryanxious with this baby. I mean, I think it sort of started when you werepregnant, remember? I mean, you were so scared for Danny\u2019s safety. In fact,you would go running between her husband and she would run to this priest, whoended up not really being a priest, but she was very concerned about Danny\u2019ssafety, and I think it's carried over because she actually went out of anapartment and left the baby locked in, she didn't turn on the baby monitor, andI think Danny came too early because she was really stressed out. Not to mentionthese horrible nightmares she was having --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Damn it, Lucy! You know it's because a vampire was after my son!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Man: You feeling sorry for yourself, kid?", "Rafe: No, it's just all these people I\u2019m supposed to be helping.", "Man: You haven't failed. Neither have they -- yet.", "Rafe: What would happen, you know, what would be so terrible about justbending the rules just a little bit?", "Man: I guess there's only one way to make you understand.", "Rafe: All right, tell me, go ahead.", "Man: If you'd followed your impulse at that moment and told Livvie, this iswhat would have happened.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: It was your desire, Olivia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: No. Look, I'll help you fight him. We'll bring him down together. I'lltell you what's really happening here. You are the one helping Caleb. He'smaking you destroy all the people you love.", "Livvie: No!", "Rafe: It's because of you that Lucy\u2019s chasing after Christina, thatKevin\u2019s going after Ian.", "Livvie: No, I don't believe you!", "Rafe: It's not your fault, but you have to remember all the things you'redoing to Jack, sabotaging Ian and eve --", "Livvie: No!", "Rafe: You're Caleb\u2019s tool!", "Livvie: No!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: You can change that, but --", "[Water splashes]", "Rafe: I -- I would have killed her.", "Man: Sorry you had to see that. Now maybe you understand.", "Rafe: Right. We guide, we plant seeds, and we hope, we hope.", "Man: We more than hope.", "Rafe: Right, we have faith that, given encouragement, people will ultimatelydo the right thing.", "Man: Now -- now you' really ready to go back.", "Rafe: I just hope I'm not too late.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caleb: Oh. I am so proud of you, Olivia. You've finally become the woman Iknew you always could be.", "Livvie: You're so right. This is incredible. You're incredible. Thank you.", "Caleb: This is our destiny. It's like I always told you. We finally haveeverything we've always wanted, and we'll have it for eternity.", "Livvie: Come up here, Daniel.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Daniel whimpers]", "Judge: Excuse me? A vampire was after your son? Are you serious?", "Ian: Yes, your honor. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true, and if you'lllet me explain, maybe you'll understand why all the other problems followed.", "Judge: I don't care to listen to either one of you at the moment. You have aninfant who has had health problems, and each of you is wasting time flingingaccusations back and forth -- unbelievable accusations -- and ridiculous excusesfor neglect that you actually believe. Whatever breakdown you're experiencing,the one thing I am sure of is that we have two parents, two doctors whose desireto get the best of each other is at the expense of their baby. I don't trustthis child with either of you. And until you prove to me otherwise, DanielThornhart is to be placed in protective custody as a temporary ward of thestate.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", ">> Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"port Charles:Tempted.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", ">> On the next \"port Charles\" --", "Woman: Please don't try to see hope any more. It's all explained in thesepapers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: This is all my fault.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: I'll run for the rest of my life, but at least you won't find my son.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: Hi, I brought Daniel. I thought he needed to be with his parents. DidI do something wrong?"], "Transcript Author": [], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KoBTqxMwV4"}
