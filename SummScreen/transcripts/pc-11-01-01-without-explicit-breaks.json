        "Jamal: So, 24/7 and cut out the eating and sleeping, we can possibly catch up\r\nto our workload. How do you like that?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I'm to blame. If you guys wouldn't have spent all your time\r\ntrying to keep me from --",
        "Jamal: What, becoming a full-fledged vampire, jack?",
        "Alison: What are friends for?",
        "Jack: Hey, you guys are the best.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Valerie: More coffee?",
        "Jamal: Valerie, you don't have to wait on us.",
        "Valerie: That's my job, Jamal. Alison, you look pretty cold. Refill?",
        "Alison: No, Valerie, thanks. Although it does seem that you have a customer.",
        "Woman: Valerie Hollander?",
        "Valerie: Yeah.",
        "Woman: My name is rosemary Morris. I am the Hartman\u2019s' attorney.",
        "Valerie: My god. Is this about my daughter? I mean, is it -- is it hope?",
        "Jamal: Excuse me. Is there a problem here?",
        "Rosemary: There's never an easy way to say this, but hope's adoptive parents\r\nno longer want you to have any contact with their child.",
        "Valerie: No. No. This can't be. There must be a mistake.",
        "Rosemary: Please, don't try to see hope anymore. It's all explained in these\r\npapers.",
        "Valerie: I don't understand. What did I do wrong?",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, jack. This is all my fault.",
        "Judge: My ruling's final. Daniel Thornhart is to be placed into protective\r\ncustody as a temporary ward of the state until we can further examine the\r\nsituation.",
        "Ian: No.",
        "Eve: I won't let you take my son.",
        "Ian: Eve, we'll fight this.",
        "Eve: You stay away from me. We wouldn't be in this situation if it hadn't\r\nbeen for you.",
        "Lucy: Wait, eve, listen -- we can call Scott. I'm sure he knows people --",
        "Eve: You've done enough, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Obviously I never intended for this to happen.",
        "Eve: Really? You made me look like some sort of lunatic who couldn't take\r\ncare of her own son!",
        "Lucy: That's not what I was trying to do! I was trying to show how upset\r\nyou've been, how worried you've been. You're the one who used the\r\n\"vampire\" word!",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I told you this would happen.",
        "Lucy: Don't you dare say, \"I told you so, \" otherwise I'm going to\r\nsmack you.",
        "Ian: Judge, please, you got to reconsider.",
        "Judge: This is not a debate, dr. Thornhart. I'm looking out for the child's\r\nwelfare.",
        "Ian: How? By taking him out of his home and placing him in the system? For\r\ngod's sake, yes, we got problems, but we're not crazy and we love our child.",
        "Eve: Please, judge. I'm his mother. I gave birth to him. I -- I know what he\r\nwants, and I know what he feels. I've taken care of him and loved him from the\r\nmoment he took his first breath.",
        "Judge: Dr. Lambert, I'm sorry.",
        "Eve: No. I won't let you take him.",
        "Judge: I'll hold you in contempt if you don't hand over your child.",
        "Eve: Fine. You can do whatever you want to me. And if I have to run for the\r\nrest of my life, you will never find my son.",
        "Livvie: I brought Daniel. I thought he needed to be with his parents. Did I\r\ndo something wrong?",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc.]",
        "Alison: Oh, my god. This is terrible. The Hartman\u2019s have cut Valerie off\r\nfrom ever seeing her daughter again because of my visit to them. Oh, my god, I\r\n-- I should have never gone poking around like this.",
        "Jack: You don't know that, all right?",
        "Alison: No, jack, I showed up at their doorstep wanting proof of paternity --\r\nyou know, hope's paternity. My god, the next thing I know, they're siccing a\r\nlawyer on her. Well, I -- I can't let them do this. I'll just tell them they're\r\nwrong.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Jack: If you go over to the Hartman\u2019s' house, you're only going to make\r\nthings worse.",
        "Alison: How can this get any worse?",
        "Jack: Do you really want to know? Alison, come on. You have to stay out of\r\nthis. You know what? I don't even know why I bother because you're going to do\r\nwhatever you want to anyway.",
        "Alison: Jack, please, please, please, will you please help me? Ok, I promise\r\nthis will be the last thing that I ever ask you to do.",
        "Jack: And you expect me to believe that? What are you going to tell Jamal and\r\nValerie?",
        "Alison: Nothing, nothing. Just -- just come on.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Alison: Please, please?",
        "Jamal: I'll call my cousin Dara at the D.A.'S office and I'll find out what's\r\nup with this, ok?",
        "Valerie: Why is this happening? I've got a job. I've been paying my dues. We\r\nhad an agreement I was still going to be part of hope's life. Why are they\r\nturning on me now?",
        "Jamal: Valerie, did you start pushing for more contact or something?",
        "Valerie: No. I stayed out of their lives. I followed all their rules. I gave\r\nthem my baby, Jamal. Don't I get anything for that?",
        "Eve: It's ok, baby. Mommy's here, and she's never, ever letting you go.",
        "Livvie: Dad, what's going on?",
        "Kevin: It's complicated, Livvie.",
        "Ian: Judge, please; give us a chance to work something out.",
        "Judge: I realize this is a difficult situation, but I have seen and heard too\r\nmuch. First, you and your wife come in here, slinging all sorts of serious\r\naccusations at one another. And not the kind of things that husbands and wives\r\nnormally fight over. This is about murder, vampires, and dark forces.",
        "Ian: Eve was upset. She's a wonderful mother.",
        "Judge: I have to examine this child's environment. His parents are at each\r\nother's throats. There's so much anger and confusion. Frankly, the stability of\r\nboth parents is in question.",
        "Ian: You can't mean that.",
        "Judge: I'm ordering you both to undergo psychiatric evaluation before I\r\ndecide Daniel\u2019s future. Until then, the child will stay with social services.",
        "Eve: This is a nightmare. This isn't happening.",
        "Lucy: Please, eve. Please let me do something to make this right.",
        "Eve: Get out of my sight. It's not enough that you lost your baby, but you\r\nhad to make me lose mine, too?",
        "Lucy: That is not true.",
        "Eve: You hate the fact that I had a baby and you didn\u2019t. This is your way\r\nof getting back at me, isn't it?",
        "Kevin: Ladies, ladies, now isn't the time, please.",
        "Ian: If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here at all.",
        "Kevin: I said it's not the time to look for the moral high ground, Ian.",
        "Ian: Moral high ground, is it?",
        "Livvie: Stop it. Everybody stop it. God. You're all saying all these horrible\r\nthings to one another. Maybe this is what the judge is seeing -- all this\r\nhatred. And look what it's come to -- Daniel has lost his parents.",
        "Kevin: Livvie, calm down.",
        "Lucy: It's all right. Doc, I will take care of Livvie. Obviously your place\r\nis with eve.",
        "Ian: Judge, please, listen. You've got to reconsider. We've got to come up\r\nwith something less drastic.",
        "Judge: I'm sorry, dr. Thornhart. You and your wife can have a few minutes\r\nalone with your son before social services comes. And then you'll have to give\r\nhim up.",
        "Lucy: You feel any better with a little fresh air?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, a little, thanks.",
        "Lucy: Tell me something. Why did you bring Danny here right now? Why did you\r\ndo that?",
        "Livvie: I just got this -- this really scared feeling like I needed to bring\r\nhim somewhere safe. Great move, huh?",
        "Lucy: No, no, no, it's ok. It's not your fault. It's like this whole horrible\r\nvirus has infected all of us, you know? We vanquished the vampire, Caleb, and we\r\nshould be celebrating killing the monster, but I feel like we're all turning\r\ninto monsters ourselves.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I don't even like to think about him.",
        "Lucy: I know, but I can't seem to stop. You know I\u2019ve been running around\r\ntown, trying to tell everybody that evil is running amok, Caleb\u2019s back,\r\nunfettered evil is everywhere.",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but he's dead, Lucy. We saw him die.",
        "Lucy: You didn't think he was dead right at first, remember?",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but I think he's dead now, and I don't even want to remember\r\nthat he was ever alive.",
        "Lucy: Right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't mean to go there. In fact, I don't\r\nknow where I\u2019m going. I don't know what I'm doing. You know, I feel like I'm\r\nbecoming everybody else and I'm going crazy, too.",
        "Livvie: What do you mean?",
        "Lucy: I -- I saw Christina.",
        "Livvie: Lucy. My god, that's wonderful, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I thought so until doc so kindly pointed out that it's probably\r\njust an illusion and he said I was having some delayed Caleb post stress\r\nsyndrome or some psychobabble like that.",
        "Livvie: And you don't believe that, right?",
        "Lucy: No, I don\u2019t. I know I saw my -- listen. Look at this. This is the\r\nlatest picture I got from Julie of her. Look at her. I know every single inch of\r\nmy daughter's face. I know her.",
        "Livvie: What happened?",
        "Lucy: Well, I saw her. I know -- I know I saw her. I know it was her. And\r\nthen she just disappeared like before. It was like the whole kidnapping thing\r\ncame right back to me and she was just gone. So I didn't know what to think, but\r\nthen she called me. She was on the phone. I know that was her little voice on\r\nthe phone.",
        "Livvie: You need some company?",
        "Lucy: I'm supposed to be consoling you.",
        "Livvie: Hey, we'll take care of each other.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that would be nice. Why don't you come sleep over, and I'll buy\r\nus four gallons of ice cream.",
        "Livvie: All right. We'll get through this.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "[Caleb's music plays]",
        "Lucy: Christina. It's mommy. Christina? Livvie? Was it is? Something wrong?\r\nWhat are you thinking?",
        "Livvie: I was --",
        "[Music stops]",
        "Livvie: I was just thinking I need to go home and pack some bags and come on\r\nover.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Ok.",
        "Livvie: Ok?",
        "Lucy: Ok. Hurry.",
        "Alison: Thank you so much for seeing us.",
        "Jack: Yes, and we won't stay long.",
        "Dr. Hartman: We're on our way out.",
        "Alison: Look; you don't understand how crushed Valerie was when your lawyer\r\ntold her she could never see her daughter ever again.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: Our daughter.",
        "Alison: Right. Yes. And -- and she totally understands that.",
        "Jack: I think what Alison\u2019s trying to say is that she feels bad if she's\r\ncaused any trouble.",
        "Alison: Yes. Please don't punish Valerie for my visit to you. I mean, I found\r\nout what I needed to know -- that my boyfriend couldn't possibly be hope's\r\nfather, seeing as though she was so premature and all. So can't things go back\r\nto the way they used to be?",
        "Dr. Hartman: Actually, we've been thinking about taking this step for a long\r\ntime. You did us a favor.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: Your visit just confirmed that this informal agreement we had\r\nwith Valerie was a bad idea. It'll be very confusing for hope, as she gets\r\nolder.",
        "Alison: How could it be confusing for a little girl to know that the woman\r\nwho gave birth to her loves her?",
        "Dr. Hartman: We're not trying to hurt Valerie. We're trying to do what's best\r\nfor our daughter.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: And it's well within our legal rights.",
        "Dr. Hartman: I believe we've answered all your questions, so as far as we're\r\nconcerned, these discussions are over and so are your visits.",
        "Jack: Sir, can't we just work something out so that nobody gets hurt?",
        "Dr. Hartman: That's our final decision. And if either one of you show up here\r\nagain, you'll be dealing with the police.",
        "Hope: Mommy.",
        "Eve: How am I supposed to say good-bye to my baby?",
        "Ian: It's only temporary. We'll fight this.",
        "Judge: I'm sorry, but we need to get Daniel settled in with child protective\r\nservices now.",
        "Eve: No. No, I'm not ready yet. You can't just take him away from me. He's\r\njust an innocent baby. He doesn't know what's happening.",
        "Judge: Have you considered getting some help, dr. Lambert? Maybe some\r\nmedication? You seem a little out of control.",
        "Ian: How is she supposed to act? You're taking our child away.",
        "Judge: Like responsible adults.",
        "Woman: I'll take Daniel now.",
        "Eve: No. Wait. There are some things that you need to know about Danny, like\r\nhe's a very fussy eater and you have to hold his bottle at a certain angle. And\r\n-- and his monitor goes off sometimes for no reason at all and he gets really\r\nscared and you have to comfort him. Will you remember that?",
        "Woman: I'll take good care of him.",
        "Eve: He needs his favorite toy. He can't sleep without his favorite toy.",
        "Woman: We have other toys.",
        "Eve: No. He needs this one. Please don't take him without his favorite toy.\r\nPlease don't take my baby.",
        "Ian: It's ok. We'll bring you home soon, son.",
        "Woman: Come on, Daniel.",
        "Eve: Baby, it's ok, sweetie. It's ok, Danny. You got him? Wait. Here's his\r\ntoy. Be brave, Danny, ok? Be a brave little boy and remember just because\r\nmommy's not with you, I love you. I love you.",
        "Eve: No.",
        "Alison: You know if my -- thank you -- if my career waitressing doesn't work\r\nout, well, then I can always become a diplomat. Why couldn't I have just\r\nlistened to you and stayed far, far, far away?",
        "Jack: Alison, you thought Jamal was the father, all right? You had to find\r\nout.",
        "Alison: I know. But, like usual, I took it way, way, way too far.",
        "Jack: You know, they did hustle us out of there.",
        "Alison: Yeah? So?",
        "Jack: Well -- I don't know. It seems like they were a little more nervous\r\nthan they were mad, like they were ready to get us out of there, you know,\r\nquick.",
        "Alison: Yeah. You know something? You're right. Well, do -- you think that\r\nthey were, like, hiding something or --",
        "Jack: I don't know. Now you got me doing it -- looking for things that aren't\r\nthere. You know what? Let's just quit while we're behind.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: What do we do?",
        "Dr. Hartman: We go on with our lives and we love our daughter.",
        "Mrs. Hartman: But we lied.",
        "Dr. Hartman: We will not lose our daughter.",
        "Jamal: Say it again? Ok. All right, thank you very much.",
        "Jamal: Sorry. I talked to my cousin Dara in the D.A.'S office.",
        "Valerie: And there's nothing she can do.",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm really sorry, Valerie.",
        "Valerie: That's ok. It was my choice. I gave her up. There's nothing legal\r\nbetween the Hartman\u2019s and me. I just thought if I can watch her grow up, I\r\nwould somehow be a part of her life. But now -- oh, god. Now I'll never see my\r\nbaby again, Jamal.",
        "Jamal: Come here, come here, come here, come here. Come here.",
        "Eve: My arms feel so empty. What if I never get Danny back? What if this is\r\nit? What if I've lost him forever?",
        "Kevin: No, don't say that. I know people, eve. I'll get them to help you.",
        "Eve: Every day, every hour, he changes in so many amazing ways. And I won't\r\nbe there to see it. What's going to happen when Danny cries and I'm not there?\r\nWho's going to tell him that I didn't give him away?",
        "Kevin: Eve, listen to me. I'll talk to the court psychiatrist. I swear to you\r\nI will make this right.",
        "Eve: Please, Kevin. This hurts so much, I can barely breathe. Please help me\r\nget my baby back.",
        "Kevin: I promise.",
        "Eve: Oh. Danny. Danny.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lucy: Livvie, hey --",
        "Ian: Hey, I was -- I was just in the neighborhood.",
        "Lucy: Hey. Looks like we both could use a friend. Come on in.",
        "Ian: I -- I didn't want to be in that hotel room anymore.",
        "Lucy: Well, you know what? That's ok because it just so happens you can stay\r\nhere tonight.",
        "[Caleb's music plays]",
        "Lucy: Christina. It's mommy. Christina? Christina?",
        "Kevin: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Oh! Doc, it's Christina. She's here.",
        "Kevin: Where?",
        "Lucy: There -- doc, I've got to go after her!",
        "Livvie: Red? Oh, my god, it can't be. It was me. I'm the one who's been\r\nhelping Caleb.",
