Why are theyturning on me now?", "Jamal: Valerie, did you start pushing for more contact or something?", "Valerie: No. I stayed out of their lives. I followed all their rules.

First, you and your wife come in here, slinging all sorts of seriousaccusations at one another. And not the kind of things that husbands and wivesnormally fight over. This is about murder, vampires, and dark forces.", "Ian: Eve was upset. She's a wonderful mother.", "Judge: I have to examine this child's environment. His parents are at eachother's throats. There's so much anger and confusion. Frankly, the stability ofboth parents is in question.", "Ian: You can't mean that.", "Judge: I'm ordering you both to undergo psychiatric evaluation before Idecide Daniel\u2019s future.

Why did you bring Danny here right now? Why did youdo that?", "Livvie: I just got this -- this really scared feeling like I needed to bringhim somewhere safe. Great move, huh?", "Lucy: No, no, no, it's ok. It's not your fault. It's like this whole horriblevirus has infected all of us, you know? We vanquished the vampire, Caleb, and weshould be celebrating killing the monster, but I feel like we're all turninginto monsters ourselves.", "Livvie: Yeah, I don't even like to think about him.", "Lucy: I know, but I can't seem to stop. You know I\u2019ve been running aroundtown, trying to tell everybody that evil is running amok, Caleb\u2019s back,unfettered evil is everywhere.", "Livvie: Yeah, but he's dead, Lucy. We saw him die.", "Lucy: You didn't think he was dead right at first, remember?", "Livvie: Yeah, but I think he's dead now, and I don't even want to rememberthat he was ever alive.", "Lucy: Right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't mean to go there. In fact, I don'tknow where I\u2019m going. I don't know what I'm doing. You know, I feel like I'mbecoming everybody else and I'm going crazy, too.", "Livvie: What do you mean?", "Lucy: I -- I saw Christina.", "Livvie: Lucy. My god, that's wonderful, Lucy.", "Lucy: Yeah, I thought so until doc so kindly pointed out that it's probablyjust an illusion and he said I was having some delayed Caleb post stresssyndrome or some psychobabble like that.", "Livvie: And you don't believe that, right?", "Lucy: No, I don\u2019t. I know I saw my -- listen. Look at this. This is thelatest picture I got from Julie of her. Look at her. I know every single inch ofmy daughter's face. I know her.", "Livvie: What happened?", "Lucy: Well, I saw her. I know -- I know I saw her. I know it was her. Andthen she just disappeared like before. It was like the whole kidnapping thingcame right back to me and she was just gone. So I didn't know what to think, butthen she called me. She was on the phone. I know that was her little voice onthe phone.", "Livvie: You need some company?", "Lucy: I'm supposed to be consoling you.", "Livvie: Hey, we'll take care of each other.", "Lucy: Yeah, that would be nice. Why don't you come sleep over, and I'll buyus four gallons of ice cream.", "Livvie: All right. We'll get through this.", "Lucy: Yeah.", "[Caleb's music plays]", "Lucy: Christina. It's mommy.

Hurry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Thank you so much for seeing us.", "Jack: Yes, and we won't stay long.", "Dr. Hartman: We're on our way out.", "Alison: Look; you don't understand how crushed Valerie was when your lawyertold her she could never see her daughter ever again.", "Mrs. Hartman: Our daughter.", "Alison: Right. Yes. And -- and she totally understands that.", "Jack: I think what Alison\u2019s trying to say is that she feels bad if she'scaused any trouble.", "Alison: Yes. Please don't punish Valerie for my visit to you. I mean, I foundout what I needed to know -- that my boyfriend couldn't possibly be hope'sfather, seeing as though she was so premature and all. So can't things go backto the way they used to be?", "Dr. Hartman: Actually, we've been thinking about taking this step for a longtime. You did us a favor.", "Mrs. Hartman: Your visit just confirmed that this informal agreement we hadwith Valerie was a bad idea. It'll be very confusing for hope, as she getsolder.", "Alison: How could it be confusing for a little girl to know that the womanwho gave birth to her loves her?", "Dr. Hartman: We're not trying to hurt Valerie. We're trying to do what's bestfor our daughter.", "Mrs. Hartman: And it's well within our legal rights.", "Dr. Hartman: I believe we've answered all your questions, so as far as we'reconcerned, these discussions are over and so are your visits.", "Jack: Sir, can't we just work something out so that nobody gets hurt?", "Dr. Hartman: That's our final decision. And if either one of you show up hereagain, you'll be dealing with the police.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Mommy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: How am I supposed to say good-bye to my baby?", "Ian: It's only temporary. We'll fight this.", "Judge: I'm sorry, but we need to get Daniel settled in with child protectiveservices now.", "Eve: No. No, I'm not ready yet. You can't just take him away from me. He'sjust an innocent baby. He doesn't know what's happening.", "Judge: Have you considered getting some help, dr. Lambert? Maybe somemedication? You seem a little out of control.", "Ian: How is she supposed to act? You're taking our child away.", "Judge: Like responsible adults.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Woman: I'll take Daniel now.", "Eve: No. Wait. There are some things that you need to know about Danny, likehe's a very fussy eater and you have to hold his bottle at a certain angle. And-- and his monitor goes off sometimes for no reason at all and he gets reallyscared and you have to comfort him. Will you remember that?", "Woman: I'll take good care of him.", "Eve: He needs his favorite toy. He can't sleep without his favorite toy.", "Woman: We have other toys.", "Eve: No. He needs this one. Please don't take him without his favorite toy.Please don't take my baby.", "Ian: It's ok. We'll bring you home soon, son.", "Woman: Come on, Daniel.", "Eve: Baby, it's ok, sweetie. It's ok, Danny. You got him? Wait. Here's histoy. Be brave, Danny, ok? Be a brave little boy and remember just becausemommy's not with you, I love you. I love you.", "Eve: No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: You know if my -- thank you -- if my career waitressing doesn't workout, well, then I can always become a diplomat. Why couldn't I have justlistened to you and stayed far, far, far away?", "Jack: Alison, you thought Jamal was the father, all right? You had to findout.", "Alison: I know. But, like usual, I took it way, way, way too far.", "Jack: You know, they did hustle us out of there.", "Alison: Yeah? So?", "Jack: Well -- I don't know. It seems like they were a little more nervousthan they were mad, like they were ready to get us out of there, you know,quick.", "Alison: Yeah. You know something? You're right. Well, do -- you think thatthey were, like, hiding something or --", "Jack: I don't know. Now you got me doing it -- looking for things that aren'tthere. You know what? Let's just quit while we're behind.", "Alison: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mrs. Hartman: What do we do?", "Dr. Hartman: We go on with our lives and we love our daughter.", "Mrs. Hartman: But we lied.", "Dr. Hartman: We will not lose our daughter.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Say it again? Ok. All right, thank you very much.", "Jamal: Sorry. I talked to my cousin Dara in the D.A.'S office.", "Valerie: And there's nothing she can do.", "Jamal: Look, I'm really sorry, Valerie.", "Valerie: That's ok. It was my choice. I gave her up. There's nothing legalbetween the Hartman\u2019s and me. I just thought if I can watch her grow up, Iwould somehow be a part of her life. But now -- oh, god. Now I'll never see mybaby again, Jamal.", "Jamal: Come here, come here, come here, come here. Come here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: My arms feel so empty. What if I never get Danny back? What if this isit? What if I've lost him forever?", "Kevin: No, don't say that. I know people, eve. I'll get them to help you.", "Eve: Every day, every hour, he changes in so many amazing ways. And I won'tbe there to see it. What's going to happen when Danny cries and I'm not there?Who's going to tell him that I didn't give him away?", "Kevin: Eve, listen to me. I'll talk to the court psychiatrist. I swear to youI will make this right.", "Eve: Please, Kevin. This hurts so much, I can barely breathe. Please help meget my baby back.", "Kevin: I promise.", "Eve: Oh. Danny. Danny.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Doorbell rings]", "Lucy: Livvie, hey --", "Ian: Hey, I was -- I was just in the neighborhood.", "Lucy: Hey. Looks like we both could use a friend. Come on in.", "Ian: I -- I didn't want to be in that hotel room anymore.", "Lucy: Well, you know what? That's ok because it just so happens you can stayhere tonight.", "[Caleb's music plays]", "Lucy: Christina. It's mommy. Christina? Christina?", "Kevin: Lucy --", "Lucy: Oh! Doc, it's Christina.
