        "Stephen: Great party, isn't it? ",
        "Alison: Um, yes. We actually just got here, but the place looks great. Talk about a Stephen Clay Experience -- ",
        "[Alison laughs] ",
        "Alison: So, do you know who he is? I'm sure you probably can't tell us, right, because of the whole mystery thing? Well, if I had to guess, I would think that it was that guy right there. I'm sorry, I'm just a really big fan. ",
        "Rafe: Anyway, this is Alison. I'm Rafe Kovich. ",
        "Alison: Hi. ",
        "Rafe: And you are? ",
        "Stephen: I'm -- pleased to meet you. ",
        "Man: Excuse us. ",
        "Alison: Excuse me. That guy was just right here and now -- ",
        "Rafe: He's gone. ",
        "Alison: He's gone. Wait, that's a little weird. Don't you think? Who do you think he is? ",
        "**************************************************************************************************",
        "Frank: I don't know what it is about tonight, this place, but I feel -- ",
        "Karen: Yeah. Me, too. ",
        "Frank: I feel more in love with you right now than I have ever felt in my life. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Chris: I can't seem to get enough of you tonight. ",
        "Doree: Well, don't stop trying. ",
        "Chris: Is it me, or is it just this place, the food -- ",
        "Doree: No, no. It's just -- it's just you, Chris. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Joshua: Stephen, there you are. Would you like some liquid refreshment? ",
        "Stephen: Oh, I'm parched. I don't mind if I do. ",
        "Joshua: So what do you think? I trust things are going just as you hoped? ",
        "Stephen: Better than I could've ever hoped for. I even found a few new surprises. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: Wow. What -- what was that? I mean, it was amazing. No, it was not. It was crazy. What are we doing? We can't be doing this. I mean, this -- we can't -- no, no, no, no. We have a situation here with Kevin and all and -- you know, maybe it's because I lean on you so much, I do, I admit it. Maybe I lean on you -- maybe this is the part where you're supposed to tell a joke about the punch being spiked and, you know, we kind of laugh and maybe let us off the hook, right? Maybe? ",
        "Ian: No. Not this time, Lucy. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: Tess, what happened? Are you bleeding? Livvie, what did you do to her? ",
        "Livvie: What did I do? What about what she did, Jack? Look at me! She's the one who got scratched and I am bleeding in the same exact spot! What is that? What the hell are you, Tess? ",
        "Jack: Let me see that. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, look at it, Jack. Look at her. It's the same exact cut. ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. The marks are identical. ",

        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait -- whoa -- what do you mean, not this time? What are you talking about? What -- what are you saying? You're not going to let us off the hook this time? Is that what you meant? I mean, what -- are you saying things have to change because of one impetuous kiss, that we can't be friends anymore? I -- things can't go back to the way they were? I don't want that to happen. ",
        "Ian: I -- ",
        "Lucy: Wait -- what -- what is this? We're not friends? I mean, you're my very best friend. I -- I don't want to lose that over a kiss, even though it was really a great kiss. I -- that's not what you meant, right? ",
        "Ian: Uh, no. No, that's -- that's not what I meant. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, good. Ok. What -- what exactly did you mean? ",
        "Ian: Uh, a lot changed this summer. ",
        "Lucy: Changed? Oh -- what changed? What? ",
        "Ian: We're friends, we've always been friends. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, we're very best friends. We have been through so much together. Together. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know, we have, and I honor that. I do. Um -- but you know that something happened, Lucy. You know something's happening. You know that. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I -- ",
        "[phone rings] ",
        "Lucy: I guess I'm saved by the bell. Should you get that? You need -- do you need to get that? ",
        "Ian: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Ok. ",
        "Ian: Thornhart. ",
        "Jack: Hey, Ian, it's Jack. ",
        "Ian: Jack. I'm a little busy right now. Can I call you back, please? ",
        "Jack: I think you might want to hear this. It has to do with Tess and Livvie. Something happened. ",
        "Ian: What? What is it? ",
        "Jack: Look, it's kind of hard to describe on the phone, but Tess hurt her hand, and Livvie, who wasn't hurt, started bleeding in the exact same place. ",
        "Ian: She what? ",
        "Jack: I know it sounds crazy, but maybe you should come over here and see for yourself. ",
        "Ian: Ok. I'm -- I'm on my way. ",
        "Lucy: What? What is it? What happened? ",
        "Ian: It's Jack. I got to go over there. Something with Tess and Livvie. ",
        "Lucy: I knew it. See, I told you that -- ok, let's go. I'll go with you. ",
        "Ian: No. You stay here, enjoy the party. There's nothing you can do, anyway. ",
        "Lucy: I don't want to be at the party without you, and we can't exactly leave what just happened like this. ",
        "Ian: I don't want to leave, but I have to go. ",
        "Lucy: No, wait. You know we need to talk about this. I can't just let this go. ",
        "Ian: We will talk. We'll talk later. ",
        "Lucy: No. No, no, no. I'm not good at \"later.\" You know -- I'm not -- no. I don't like \"later.\" I'm not -- I'm not doing \"later.\" ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: It's going to be ok, Tess. Ian's on his way, all right? He's going to help us out. It's all right. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on, Jack, there's nothing to figure out. That -- that person, that thing is some kind of freak. I don't need Ian to tell me that. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, stop. ",
        "Livvie: No. She may have sucked you in already, but she's not going to get me. I'm out of here. ",
        "Tess: A freak? ",
        "Jack: It's ok. She just doesn't quite understand you, all right? And I'm not sure if I do, either, but I will. I promise. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Livvie: God, what is it with her? Who is she and why does she look like me? I mean, I feel like someone is trying to drive me crazy here. But who? Who would have the power to do this? Who would have the power to create this creature and send her down from god knows where to steal my whole life? I mean, I -- I suppose it could be Alison. She is really pissed off at me, but -- god, no, she couldn't do this. No, it's not Alison. It's her great protector, my angelic ex -- Rafe. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Alison: Oh, look. There's Karen and frank! And Doree and Chris, and they need to get a room. ",
        "Rafe: How did he just disappear like that? ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe he's shy. ",
        "Rafe: You know what it is? It's almost like he didn't want us to know his name. ",
        "Alison: What? Rafe, look, enough with the masked man, ok? It's supposed to be creepy. This is Halloween. And if you'd notice, everyone is wearing a mask. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I see that. What's that all about? You know, it's because of that damn mask. If I could -- ",
        "Alison: Hi -- ",
        "Rafe: Have just gotten it off -- ",
        "Alison: It's Halloween. ",
        "Rafe: Halloween. I know. And you know what? This isn't scary, ok? It's scary. It's not scary. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe -- maybe because it's sexier kissing a stranger. Huh? Huh? ",
        "Rafe: You know what? ",
        "Alison: Come on. ",
        "Rafe: Nothing is sexier than kissing the woman I love. ",
        "Alison: No that is more like it. ",
        "Rafe: No, I'm sorry. I don't want to spoil your good time. ",
        "Alison: You're not spoiling my good time, I promise you. But how about, just for one night, we put away what is bothering us? Ok, let's not -- just forget about this masked man -- ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Alison: My mother -- ",
        "Rafe: Ah, definitely. ",
        "Alison: And the two Livvies, and let them fend for themselves, ok, just for one night. What do you say? ",
        "Rafe: I say that is a brilliant idea. ",
        "Alison: That's what I thought. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Bartender: Pretty lady like you partying all alone? Why aren't you at the big Halloween bash? ",
        "Elizabeth: Let's just say my daughter and her fianc\u00e9 are there. I don't know which one I'm trying to avoid more. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Alison: Wait. Did you feel that? ",
        "Rafe: What? Feel what? ",
        "Alison: All of our problems just melted away just like that. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. Yeah. ",
        "Alison: See, Rafe, as long as you and I are together, nothing in this whole world can touch us. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: Listen to me, all right? Look, I know you're scared, but you don't need to be, because I called Ian. ",
        "Tess: No Ian, just -- just Jack. ",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, but it can't be just me anymore. ",
        "Tess: Why? ",
        "Jack: Because you are a very, very special person, all right, and Ian is going to come help us and find out more about you. He's going to help you. ",
        "Tess: Help me? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Help find out more about your powers, and if there's -- well, if there's a connection to Livvie. ",
        "Tess: No. No, Livvie's bad. No. ",
        "Jack: No, Tess -- Tess, you're right, you're right. You're absolutely right. Livvie is terrible, she's bad. But Ian's not. Ian's good. And you know what else? Ian has a baby. He has a little baby boy, so he knows what it's like to be gentle. ",
        "Tess: A baby? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. And he had a wife who he loved more than anything. And she died, which -- which means that -- ",
        "Tess: I -- I know. ",
        "Jack: So Ian knows what it's like to be afraid. But the most important thing is I wouldn't have called him if I didn't trust him. We can trust him. You and me, together, we can trust him. Ian is only going to help us. Ok? ",
        "Tess: Ok. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Now we just need Ian to get here. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: So, you know, about that, uh, kiss thing that happened -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah, if -- ",
        "Lucy: We were talking about it -- ",
        "Ian: If you insist on coming with me, so be it, but we need to focus. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. I'm focused. I'm very focused. I'm just as interested in figuring out this whole Livvie-Tess thing as you are. It's just, you know, maybe we should continue that conversation that we started about that thing -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah -- why can't \"later\" actually mean \"later\"? ",
        "Lucy: I hate \"later.\" \"Later's\" no good. We need to do this now, because if we wait till later, like -- well, maybe tomorrow neither one of us are even going to want to bring this up. And then when we're together in a room, it could be like this big, fat elephant sitting on us or just there with us and we can't even bring it up ever. And then things could get weird and that is the last thing I want to happen. ",
        "Ian: It's not going to be weird. ",
        "Lucy: Are you sure? ",
        "Ian: No, I'm not sure. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, that -- that's great. That is really swell. ",
        "Ian: Let's just deal with one thing at a time. That's about all I can handle right now, ok? ",
        "Lucy: No -- ",
        "men: Trick or treat trick or treat ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Hey, guys -- ",
        "men: Trick or treat ",
        "Lucy: Listen -- wait -- sorry. You know what? We don't have any candy. You could try the houses here -- this one or down there. ",
        "Men: Trick or treat. ",
        "Ian: You heard the lady -- just go, try the houses down there, ok? ",
        "Man: We said \"trick or treat.\" ",
        "Second man: Now, which is it going to be? ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Alison: See? Isn't this better? This is exactly what you and I needed. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah, it's great. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, I thought that you said you were going to relax. ",
        "Rafe: I am, I'm relaxed! Sorry. I am as relaxed as I can be for a slayer on Halloween, ok? ",
        "Alison: I'm serious. ",
        "Rafe: I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to ruin your great night. ",
        "Alison: You're not ruining my night. I just -- I want you to have fun with me. I mean, we really deserve this. ",
        "Rafe: You're right. You're right, and I'm trying. Ok? ",
        "Alison: You really are feeling something, aren't you? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, and you know what? It's not just at the party. I'm feeling it for a while. ",
        "Alison: Well -- um -- you know, maybe it's -- maybe it's my mother. Elizabeth hasn't exactly been a ray of sunshine. ",
        "Rafe: Well, that's what I thought at first. ",
        "Alison: And now? ",
        "Rafe: Now I know that it's not just that, and it's not just this whole Livvie thing, either. ",
        "Alison: Wait -- the Livvie thing? I thought you were just kidding about the Livvie thing. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, no, I'm not kidding. I'm telling you, it turns out that this girl Jack's been seeing actually looks a lot like her, I mean a lot like her identical twin. ",
        "Alison: Ok, this isn't good. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. No, I know it's not good. It's just that something's going on. I don't know what it is, but something -- and I don't want to scare you, but I'm glad you know now, so just keep your guard up, all right? ",
        "Alison: No, you're not scaring me at all. I'm glad that you told me, but do you have any idea what it could be at all? ",
        "Rafe: I don't have a clue. But there's something -- something's changing in the atmosphere. There's something happening or about to happen. It's just tonight -- tonight I feel it like I never felt it before. Something is out there. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Livvie: Excuse me, please. Ok, where are you, Rafe? I know you're here. Excuse me. Please, excuse me. ",
        "Stephen: Dance? ",
        "Livvie: No, thanks, I'm -- I'm looking for somebody. ",
        "Stephen: I think you found him. ",
        "Livvie: No, really, I got to go! I'm looking for someone. ",
        "Livvie: Who are you? ",
        "[Music plays] ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know how much this night meant to you, the party, having a good time and everything. ",
        "Alison: No, it's ok, it's ok. If what you say is true -- ",
        "Rafe: No, I -- you know what? I don't know if it is or not. I just know that I got to be in focus about what's going on. I know that. After you. ",
        "Alison: Rafe? Is that Livvie dancing with your masked man? ",
        "[Music plays] ",
        "Rafe: Excuse me. Maybe it's time that you tell me your name. ",
        "Joshua: Is something wrong, my dear? ",
        "Livvie: I -- I thought -- I thought you were someone else. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: You look like you could use a friend. ",
        "Elizabeth: I have enough friends. I don't need any more. ",
        "Stephen: Oh. You can never have too many friends. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, I guess you can't. ",
        "************************************************************************************************",
        "Ian: Why don't you take your friend and be on your way? We don't want any trouble here. ",
        "Man: I don't think so. ",
        "Second man: Not till we get our candy. And something tells me you're holding out on us, lady. ",
        "Lucy: No, really. I don't have anything, I swear. No! ",
        "Ian: Touch the lady and I'll kill you. Now, go home before this gets out of control, all right? ",
        "Man: No one's going anywhere. ",
        "Ian: Go, go in. I got this. Go. ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm not leaving you. ",
        "Ian: Just go! Go! ",
        "Lucy: No! No! ",
        "[Lucy screams] ",
        "Lucy: Ian! ",
