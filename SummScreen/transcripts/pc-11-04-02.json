        "Joshua: I'm Joshua Temple. I'm sorry for the confusion. I manage \r\nthe band. It seems like everyone confuses me for someone else. ",

        "Lucy: Ok. Oh, wait, your phone. I'll get the phone. I'm going to \r\ncall the hospital. Oh, you're going to be ok. Oh! Hello, this is Lucy Coe \r\nCollins! I'm at the Ramsey house at the mouth of the river! Dr. Thornhart has \r\nbeen stabbed! I need an ambulance right away! ",

        "Rafe: Well, whoever I thought it was under this mask, either I \r\nwas wrong or he's long gone. ",
        "Joshua: Are you going to be all right? ",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, she's always like this. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I'm fine. ",
        "Joshua: You should tell your friends to lighten up. It's only \r\nrock 'n' roll, but you'll like it. Enjoy the party, kids. ",
        "Alison: Ok, I'm confused. Can somebody please tell me what's \r\ngoing on here? ",
        "Rafe: Tell her, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: I don't know. ",
        "Rafe: Tell here what you were feeling. You sensed something, \r\njust like I did. ",
        "Livvie: I don't know what you're talking about. ",
        "Rafe: You said you thought -- ",
        "Livvie: Rafe, I don't know what you're talking about! ",
        "Rafe: Who did you think it was? ",
        "Livvie: I only came here to find you and tell you to get rid of \r\nher. ",
        "Rafe: Who? What are you talking about? ",
        "Livvie: Tess! That -- that gross, mute bundle of goodness who \r\nlives in the forest and happens to look exactly like me. What, is she your \r\nversion of a Grimm's fairy tale? ",
        "Alison: No, I wish you had made it up. Look at how upset it \r\nmakes her. ",
        "Livvie: Don't play me for stupid. It was no accident. I know you \r\nsprinkled your little fairy magic dust and created her to destroy whatever is \r\nleft of my life. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. I told you, I have no more angel dust, I have no more \r\nmagic powers. But you know what? If I did have the power to create another \r\nperson, I wouldn't waste it creating another you! ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Rafe, don't lie to me! I know you want to destroy \r\nme. I know it. And you should see him with her. He thinks that she is just as \r\ncute as a bucket of puppies! It makes me sick! ",
        "Rafe: All right, just give it up, ok? I do not want to destroy \r\nyou. But you know what, someone else might want to. ",
        "Livvie: What's that supposed to mean? ",
        "Rafe: What were you feeling when you were dancing with that man, \r\nhuh? At were you thinking? Come on, Livvie, just tell me. ",
        "Livvie: No, you know what, I don't have to tell you anything.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Tell me. Tell me. Livvie? Livvie? ",
        "Alison: No, leave her alone! It's not worth the time! What is \r\ngoing on, please? ",
        "Rafe: Don't you think I would tell you if I knew? I'm sorry. I'm \r\nsorry. It's just Livvie and that -- that man, the man standing there in the \r\nmask, dancing with her. ",
        "Alison: What, are you talking about Joshua? ",
        "Rafe: Yes, I\u2019m -- well, no. I don't know, I mean, I -- it felt \r\nlike i knew him. It felt like -- it felt like i fought him before or something, \r\nbut then i took his mask off and it just wasn't what i expected. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, I'm sorry, I don't -- ",
        "Rafe: I just -- I wish i had my powers back for one day just so \r\nI'd know for sure. ",
        "Alison: No, no, no, don't -- don't you even say that. I don't \r\nwant you to wish it, I don't want you to think it. Because that means that I \r\nwould lose you all over again, and that terrifies me. ",

        "Lucy: Go to the road! Make sure the ambulance knows where we \r\nare. Make sure they find us. Hurry up. ",
        "Jack: All right, be right back. Stay here with Lucy. I'll be \r\nright back, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Ian, no, listen to me -- Ian, look at me. Look at me now, \r\nplease. ",
        "Ian: Danny. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, Danny. You have to focus on your little boy. ",
        "Ian: He needs you. ",
        "Lucy: No. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: No, he doesn't. He needs you. You're his father and you \r\nneed to be with him. Oh, Ian Thornhart, you are the most stubborn, mule-headed \r\nman I've ever met in my life, and you are not ever giving up on anything, \r\nespecially now! ",
        "[Ian groans] ",
        "Lucy: Listen to me -- no! I'm so sorry you're hurting, but for \r\nGod's sakes, hang on for Danny! ",
        "Ian: Promise you'll take care of him, ok? ",
        "Lucy: No! I won't promise you that because you have to raise \r\nyour son. Every scraped elbow and every little bedtime story and every time the \r\ntooth fairy has to visit, that's your job! You are going to raise your son! ",
        "[Ian groans] ",
        "Ian: I got to go see Eve. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not time! No, it's not -- it's not time. You have \r\nmany years until you see eve. Do you know how mad eve is going to be if you \r\nleave your son, especially if you leave him with me? She'll never forgive you. \r\nPlease, Ian. ",
        "Ian: You're a wonderful mother. You're a wonderful woman. ",
        "Lucy: No, Ian, you're my -- my best friend in the whole world! \r\nIan Thornhart, I love you and you cannot die on me! ",
        "Ian: I'm so cold right now. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, they're here. Oh, my God, Ian, help's here. Tess, give \r\nme your hand! I want you to put your hand right there and keep that pressure on. \r\nI'm going to make sure that Jack finds them. ",

        "Lucy: He's over here! Hurry, he's this way! ",
        "Jack: There's blood everywhere, Frank! Come on! ",
        "Lucy: He was stabbed in the chest! He -- he -- ",
        "Frank: Excuse me, Tess. Excuse me, Tess. Having a tough night, \r\nbuddy? There's a lot of blood. ",
        "Lucy: I -- I know. I know. Oh, my God. Tell me this isn't \r\nhappening, Jack. Tell me this isn't happening. ",
        "Jack: It's going to be ok, it's going to be ok. ",
        "Frank: You know, this isn't nearly as deep as it looks. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Frank: Ian? Ian, can you hear me? Can you breathe? You're ok.\r\n",

        "Alison: Rafe, listen to me, please? I could not bear the thought \r\nof losing you again. Do you understand? ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, you're not going to, not ever. ",
        "Alison: I just want to help you if I can, ok, so -- so just let \r\nme, please? Is it the two Livvie\u2019s thing? Is that it? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know, it's -- it's just that, see, every time -- \r\nevery time i feel a fight coming on, my slayer instinct gets all up on edge. ",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Rafe: I can sense whatever it is I'm about to face. See, that's \r\nwhat protects me. But now it's like there's this velvet curtain surrounding \r\nwhatever it is that's giving off this weird vibe, and I just wish that I could \r\nseparate the curtain just for a second so I could reveal whoever or whatever it \r\nis. ",
        "Alison: And this has never happened before? ",
        "Rafe: No, never. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe it's -- maybe it's something totally \r\ndifferent, you know? I mean, you said that this just started happening since you \r\ncame back to earth, so maybe it's something else that you're tapping into, maybe \r\nsomething completely different. ",
        "Rafe: Like? ",
        "Alison: I don't know. ",
        "Rafe: Wow. Look at you. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: Everything you're going through, and I got your head \r\nspinning over something that I can't even put into words. ",
        "Alison: No, stop it. It's ok, Rafe. It's ok. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, it's not. You're dealing with losing your \r\nfather. ",
        "Alison: And gaining a mother, which I'm really not sure which \r\none is worse. ",
        "Rafe: Well, whichever, I have no business adding more trouble to \r\nthe mix. ",
        "Alison: I just don't know how to help you, and I want to, but I \r\ndon't know how. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you know what? I know how. First I'm going to take a \r\ndeep breath. And then I\u2019m going to stop driving us both crazy. I'm just going to \r\njust shake it all out -- ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Rafe: Get rid of it all, and then you and me, we're going to \r\nstart living a normal life, all right? Don't let me forget that -- a normal \r\nlife, ok? ",
        "Alison: I won't, I promise. When do we start? ",
        "Rafe: Well, we're going to start tomorrow. ",
        "Alison: Tomorrow? ",
        "Rafe: With you. And we're going to get you a -- oh, let me see \r\n-- a manicure. ",
        "Alison: And a pedicure. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, absolutely. ",
        "Alison: Because they go together. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: And you'll get one, too. ",
        "Rafe: Absolutely. ",
        "Alison: Because I know men like them. ",
        "Rafe: Absolutely. Yeah. I really need to start taking better \r\ncare of myself. You know, I -- I got to go work off some of these bad vibes, \r\nthis bad energy. It's driving me nuts. ",
        "Alison: Tonight? ",
        "Rafe: No, no. No, not tonight. I can't leave you alone tonight.\r\n",
        "Alison: Well, Rafe, it's actually ok. I mean -- ",
        "Rafe: No, it's a bad idea, ok? ",
        "Alison: No, no, if you -- ",
        "Rafe: I'm staying with you. ",
        "Alison: No, don't be silly. Stop it. Come on, I\u2019m serious. \r\nYou'll be fine. ",
        "Rafe: Alison, I -- ",
        "Alison: No, Rafe, listen, if you really, really need to work out \r\nthese demons, then why don't you go and work on them, ok? When I come home \r\ntonight, I promise I will rub some magic right back into you. I promise. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. No, I can't, I can't. I can't leave you alone. ",
        "Alison: But why? There's millions of people in there. Doree's in \r\nthere. I'll get a ride home with Doree. I promise, ok? Everything -- \r\neverything's going to be ok. ",
        "Rafe: Right. ",
        "Alison: Ok? ",
        "Rafe: All right. Yeah. I feel better already. ",

        "oh, it was just amazing. ",
        "Stephen: Amazing. ",
        "Elizabeth: I can breathe, I can taste. Mmm. I can smell. This is \r\nlike waking up from the dead. Do you know what I mean? ",
        "Stephen: I think I do. ",
        "Elizabeth: Mmm. Oh, who are you? ",

        "Stephen: I know your name. ",
        "Elizabeth: You do? ",
        "Stephen: Beauty. Passion. Pain. ",
        "Elizabeth: You can see that? ",
        "Stephen: From the first moment I laid eyes on you. And it made \r\nme sad. ",
        "Elizabeth: God, if only you knew. My -- my husband recently \r\npassed away. ",
        "Stephen: I'm sorry. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no. No. The pain? The pain was here when he was \r\nalive. ",
        "Stephen: Did you love him? ",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm, I loved him. I loved him so much. I gave him \r\neverything I had. I gave him myself. I gave him my little baby girl. I gave him \r\neverything. And it was never enough. I was always this short of pleasing him. I \r\njust -- I could never be happy. ",
        "Stephen: Hey. So now it's your turn. ",
        "Elizabeth: Mmm. Oh, yeah, you would think so. That bastard got \r\nthe final word. All those years of just sucking the life out of me, he just \r\ndealt me one last slap in the face. He cut me out of his will. He gave \r\neverything we had to my daughter and to an illegitimate child, which, of course, \r\nI knew nothing about. So not only did he steal all those years of my life, my \r\nrelationship with my daughter, my self-esteem, he really took my security. ",
        "Stephen: How does your daughter feel about that? ",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm. I -- I've been trying so hard to build a \r\nrelationship with Alison. I've explained to her that sometimes you have to make \r\nhard choices, that -- that I have made mistakes, that doing the best that I can, \r\nbut she just -- she won't let me in. She won't even try. ",
        "Stephen: You just got to give her time. ",
        "Elizabeth: I just have a feeling it's just going to get worse. \r\nWe came so close to making a really great connection, but then -- I don't know, \r\nI think that Rafe is threatened by me. I think that he doesn't want her to be \r\nwith me. ",
        "Stephen: Rafe? ",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, Rafe Kovich, Alison\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. What? Do you \r\nknow him? ",

        "Frank: When I saw all that blood, I was worried, but -- ",
