Look, I'm sorry I missed our session tonight, but that doesn't give you or Stephen the right to track me down like I\u2019m some little kid. ", "Joshua: Is that all? ", "Marissa: No. Look, I understand that you guys work very intense and you have this routine, but you have to understand that I still get my private time, ok?

Maybe he told you all of those great little things to make you feel all warm and fuzzy just so he'd get you in a room alone?

You're the one who said we need to make it legal before we can trust each other. ", "Elizabeth: Did you sign the contract? ", "Alison: Yeah, I signed your agreement, so now we have a deal. You list every single person that my father ever slept with and had an affair with. ", "Elizabeth: So that you can find your missing brother or sister? ", "Alison: Yeah, maybe.
