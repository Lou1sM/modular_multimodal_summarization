        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Ian: You know you snore? ",
        "Lucy: I do -- I don't sn-- ok, maybe I snore a little bit. \r\nBefore you ask, Danny\u2019s fine. He's with the girls, and they're making pancakes \r\nwith Carmen. You look like you're feeling better. ",
        "Ian: Thank you. ",
        "Lucy: What are friends for? ",
        "Ian: He almost became an orphan last night. I got very close to \r\nchecking out. ",
        "Lucy: But you didn't. And Frank, somehow, didn't think that \r\nwound was as bad as we thought. ",
        "Ian: Can I tell you a secret? ",
        "Lucy: You better not, but, ok, what? ",
        "Chris: Good morning. ",
        "Lucy: Ugh. It -- it was a very good morning, Dr. Ramsey. ",
        "Chris: I heard you had quite a scary night last night \r\ntrick-or-treating. Next time you probably want to just hand over that candy. ",
        "Ian: I'll try to remember that. ",
        "Lucy: Wow! Your bedside manner hasn't improved in years. ",
        "Chris: So, I talked to Frank. He said there was a lot of blood \r\nout there. This should've been a lot worse, but you're going to be ok. We \r\nchecked your vitals. Seems like you didn't really lose that much blood at all, \r\nafter all. ",
        "Ian: I'm a lucky man. ",
        "Chris: Very lucky. I'll check back later. ",
        "Lucy: Don't hurry. ",
        "Ian: That wound should've killed me. ",
        "Lucy: But Frank -- ",
        "Ian: Forget about what Frank said. I felt the knife enter my \r\nbody. I'm a doctor. I know what organs it hit. And I was checking out. Tess came \r\nover and she touched me, and the pain went away and the blood stopped. So, what \r\nis she? A healer? Did she heal me? How is that possible? ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Tess: Smile. ",
        "Jack: Cheese. Well, that's easy because you always make me \r\nsmile. Hey, we need to talk. ",
        "Tess: Ok. Shoot. ",
        "Jack: Tess, I want to talk to you about what happened with Ian \r\nlast night. ",
        "Tess: I don't want to talk about that. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, Tess. Look, this is really, really important. \r\nOk? I just want to talk to you about kind of what happened because you fixed Ian \r\nkind of like you fixed my leg. He was about to die, and you saved him. How did \r\nyou do that? ",
        "Tess: Don't know. ",
        "Jack: Not everybody can do that. This means that you're special.\r\n",
        "Tess: No. Don't want to be special. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Livvie: Daddy? It's me, Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: I know who it is. Come here. Give your old dad a hug. ",
        "Livvie: How are you? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, well. Let me tell you, the food here is lousy. And \r\nthere's a lot of crazy people here. But I'm getting by. You look upset. ",
        "Livvie: My life is one giant mess right now, dad, and I really \r\nneed you. ",
        "Kevin: What happened this time? ",
        "Livvie: Well, this strange girl showed up in town, and she's \r\nthis goody two-shoes who everyone loves, and she looks exactly like me. I feel \r\nlike I have this creepy twin following me around. I mean, that's crazy, isn't \r\nit? ",
        "Kevin: No. That makes perfect sense. ",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc., And soapnet] ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: So, tell me. What -- what happened with Ian? ",
        "Tess: He was hurt and -- and she was crying. ",
        "Jack: Lucy? ",
        "Tess: And he was your friend, and I took the hurt away. ",
        "Jack: How? ",
        "Tess: It's -- Ahem -- sometimes I -- I see someone, and I get \r\nthis feeling here. I want to help. ",
        "Jack: Well, what's that -- that feeling like? ",
        "Tess: It's warm. ",
        "Jack: Warm. ",
        "Tess: And -- and I -- I touch them. And the warm goes -- goes \r\ninto my hands. And then they're better. Is that ok? ",
        "Jack: I don't even know if \"ok\" begins to describe it. ",
        "Tess: You're not mad? ",
        "Jack: Hey. Hey. I could never be mad at you. ",
        "Tess: Good. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Livvie: What do you -- what do you mean, this makes perfect \r\nsense? Do you know where Tess came from? Is she my sister or something? ",
        "Kevin: Well, how should I know? ",
        "Livvie: Well, I thought you just said -- ",
        "Kevin: You didn't let me finish, Livvie. I mean, how should i \r\nknow if she's your twin sister or not? I didn't even know about you until a few \r\nyears ago. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, right, but I thought maybe that mom might've --\r\n",
        "Kevin: She didn't. She didn't say anything. And I mean it makes \r\nperfect sense because it just shows how incredibly self-serving and \r\nself-centered you are to come all this way just to talk about you. ",
        "Livvie: Dad, that's not the only reason. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, of course it is. I mean, look at these. I've got \r\nletters here from Victor, Serena, even Christina. See? \"Daddy.\" But nothing from \r\nmy devoted daughter. I guess it's possible that your post card got lost in the \r\nmail. ",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I -- I do miss you. You are all I have right now.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Don't play me. I haven't forgotten how I wound up in this \r\nloony bin in the first place. What was that stuff you injected me with, anyway? \r\nThat's some powerful stuff, could make a guy crazy. Oh, wait -- it did. ",
        "Livvie: I don't want you to hate me because I\u2019ve already paid \r\nfor what I did to you. I've lost everything -- jack, Rafe, and my baby. I've \r\nlost your grandchild. ",
        "Kevin: I didn't know that. I'm sorry. ",
        "Livvie: Daddy, I wanted this baby so much, and I never meant to \r\nhurt you. Can you please forgive me? ",
        "Kevin: You know, I should call the police, give you a dose of \r\ntough love. ",
        "Livvie: You wouldn't do that, would you? ",
        "Kevin: Nah. No, I'm just kidding. Besides, actually, I think you \r\ndid me a favor. ",
        "Livvie: I did? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I think you and your magic shot actually helped me \r\nfigure out who I really am -- or, at least, who I could be. ",
        "Livvie: I'm not so sure I understand. ",
        "Kevin: I'll explain later. But right now, since I\u2019m stuck in \r\nthis dump, I need you to tell me just what my darling wife, Lucy, has been up \r\nto. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: So Tess is the un-Livvie, sweet and innocent. ",
        "Ian: Twins run in Kevin\u2019s family -- ",
        "Lucy: Please -- please don't remind me of that. ",
        "Ian: Sorry. Have you talked to him? ",
        "Lucy: No. No, and I'm -- I\u2019m not even comfortable talking about \r\nwhy I haven't talked to him, so can we not talk about that, either? ",
        "Ian: Fine. I just thought he maybe could shed some light on \r\nthis. ",
        "Lucy: No, I don't -- I don't think he can. I think it's very \r\nsimple -- Tess is good, she heals people, and Livvie makes people sick. One-stop \r\nshopping. ",
        "Ian: I'm serious. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but I can't, ok? I just -- I can't go to that \r\nplace right now, if that's all right with you. I have some really strange \r\nfeelings I\u2019m not dealing with very well. And I haven't told you this \r\nparticularly weird one, either. Since we took Kevin back to the hospital, I feel \r\nlike somebody or something is out there following us, or at least following me. \r\nAnd now Jack told us about that cut -- Livvie and Tess -- identical twins don't \r\nbleed when the other one's cut. This just makes me crazy, so I don't want \r\nanswers or any kind of explanations right now. I just want to stop thinking \r\nabout it -- ",
        "Ian: Ok. I do need some answers, so I\u2019m going to go. ",
        "Lucy: What? No! No, no, no, no, no. You need your rest. ",
        "Ian: Hand me my clothes, would you, please? ",
        "Lucy: No, I will not. You almost died last night. ",
        "Ian: Not according to Chris and Frank. So, please, hand over my \r\nclothes or I\u2019ll get them myself. ",
        "Lucy: Listen to me. Sorry. You are not going anywhere. If I have \r\nto hold you down and pin you to this bed, I will stay right here until you get \r\nbetter. ",
        "Ian: That doesn't sound half bad. ",
        "Ian: I'm not going to apologize. ",
        "Lucy: For what? ",
        "Ian: For being the first one to admit what we've been dancing \r\naround for weeks. ",
        "Lucy: Um, you -- you really should get some rest. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, that's right. We should change the subject. That's \r\nwhat we should do. Always do, right? Yeah. We both know something's happening \r\nhere. Maybe we should face it. ",
        "Lucy: We're friends. We went to a party, and we -- we danced. It \r\nwas a very nice dance, and then we had a very nice kiss. Big deal. ",
        "Ian: I kissed you because I needed to. ",
        "Lucy: But we both know this is going to absolutely not go \r\nanywhere. ",
        "Ian: Why? ",
        "Lucy: You miss eve and I miss Kevin, and we just need to feel \r\nsomebody's arms around us and maybe take some comfort from each other. ",
        "Ian: Comfort is not what I want from you right now. ",
        "Lucy: What do you want from me? ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Kevin: I want you to look beyond your horizons, expand, you \r\nknow, beyond yourself -- to Lucy and Ian, for example. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Well, put it this way -- I don't think they're up \r\ntogether all night playing cards. You know Lucy's history as well -- ",
        "Kevin: They're sleeping together? ",
        "Livvie: I wouldn't put it past them. ",
        "Kevin: You don't know for sure? ",
        "Livvie: If you're talking Polaroids, dad, no. ",
        "Kevin: All right. Well, that would make sense. I can see the way \r\nshe looks at him. I hear it in her tone of voice when she says his name. So \r\nthey've been lying to me all along. ",
        "Livvie: You know, if you ask me, dad, I say you should dust her.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, lucky for you, that's not for you to decide. No, \r\nLivvie, what I want from you is very simple. I want you to keep an eye on \r\neverything that Ian and Lucy do together, and I mean everything. ",
        "Livvie: All right. ",
        "Kevin: And I am sorry about the baby. Do you -- do you think \r\nthis Tess person had anything to do with it? ",
        "Livvie: Well, she could've. I don't know. ",
        "Kevin: The truth, Livvie. I won't help you unless you're \r\ncompletely honest with me about everything. You'll find I'm not the pushover \r\nthat I used to be. ",
        "Livvie: No. Dad, no, Tess didn't have anything to do with it. I \r\ndid something really, really stupid, something really, really terrible. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. I believe you. Now, let me tell you exactly how to \r\nhandle this Tess person. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: These right here are -- those two things right there are \r\nyour eyes. Eyes. ",
        "Tess: Eyes. ",
        "Jack: Good. Good, good, good. And right here are your lips. ",
        "Tess: Lips. ",
        "Jack: Lips. Ah! Good. ",
        "Tess: I know. Lip -- lips -- they're very good for kissing. ",
        "Jack: Right. Yeah, this is dangerous. This is very dangerous.\r\n",
        "Tess: Nice. More. ",
        "Jack: Um -- wow, this is hard. Let's change subjects. We're \r\ngoing to go to pictures, all right? Let me show you some -- some family pictures \r\nhere. We got -- ah. That's me and my brother. ",
        "Tess: Chris and Jack are brothers. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. ",
        "Tess: And the same, Livvie, like Jack and Chris -- brothers? ",
        "Jack: Is -- oh, is Livvie your sister? Do you want to know? Ok. \r\nWell, there's just going to be some things that I\u2019m going to have to do to find \r\nout if Livvie is your sister, ok? ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Ian: You want me to tell you what I want from you? ",
        "Lucy: No, I -- no, I don't -- I'm not sure. ",
        "Ian: It's not going to go away by ignoring it. ",
        "Lucy: You have to rest. You need to get your rest. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Just know I would never mess up your life, or try to.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I know. I know that. The police -- did I tell you they're \r\ncoming to take our -- ",
        "Ian: Yeah, you told me. I have nothing to say to them. You were \r\nthere. I have nothing to say. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. I -- I don't think I ever want you to be my date for \r\nanother party, if you don't mind. ",
        "Ian: I'm not a very good date. I apologize for that. ",
        "Lucy: When you were lying on the ground like that and I thought \r\nyou were dying, I felt like maybe I was going to die, too. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Jack: Hey. How you feeling? ",
        "Lucy: Hey, Jack. ",
        "Ian: I'm fine. How's Tess? ",
        "Jack: She's doing fine. Actually, I was going to maybe ask you \r\nif I could get a favor from you. ",
        "Ian: You name it. ",
        "Jack: Well, I have a sample of Tess' hair, and I know that \r\nLivvie\u2019s DNA File is here in the hospital from the paternity test you ran. ",
        "Ian: You want me to run her DNA And see if Livvie and Tess are \r\nrelated? ",
        "Jack: Well, yeah. I thought that maybe it could help us find out \r\nmore about Tess. ",
        "Ian: You saw, didn't you? ",
        "Jack: The way she healed you. That was pretty amazing. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my. I think I know that look in your eyes. ",
        "Jack: I think I'm falling in love with her. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Kevin: There's some sort of a deep connection between you and \r\nthis Tess person. You need to figure out what that is before you can do \r\nanything. ",
        "Livvie: Dad, I don't want to be friends with this freak, ok? I \r\nnever want to see her again. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, boy. You know, you can run, but you can't hide from \r\nyour other, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: My \"other\"? ",
        "Kevin: Yes, your other. That's what I've learned from Dr. Fox \r\nsince I\u2019ve been here. All of us, Livvie, have an other, another side, another \r\nhalf that has all the qualities that we lack. In some cases, it's a twin, like \r\nRyan and myself. In other cases, it's an alter ego, like Caleb and the saintly \r\nMichael. Now, think about it, Livvie. What if those two forces were able to \r\nmerge somehow? What a powerhouse they would've been. ",
        "Livvie: No, dad, but Caleb is dead. I killed him. Everybody saw \r\nit. ",
        "Kevin: You killed Caleb in the physical sense, but a man's \r\nenergy never really leaves. Only when we bring our other into alignment with \r\nourselves can we really be whole, can we really feel our true power. I'm feeling \r\nit now by accepting Ryan\u2019s energy. And you need to do that with Tess. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, so -- so you think Tess is my other. Then, what, I \r\nneed to make friends with her? Make peace with her somehow? ",
        "Kevin: Only then can you know how to use her to your best \r\nadvantage. ",
        "Livvie: Thanks, dad. I actually feel a lot better. ",
        "Kevin: Glad to hear it. And now I want you to hear something. \r\nIt's a song that Dr. Fox played for me. ",
        "Livvie: What, like music therapy or something? ",
        "Kevin: Well, all I know is it made me feel better. ",
        "Singer: Clear, white lines draw the straightest path to the main \r\nstreet of life that awaits you on crooked avenue. If you wanna walk, babe, I \r\nwill walk with you, to the freak show we created if you really wanna do with me \r\nthe one-on-one ",
        "Kevin: Where you going? ",
        "Livvie: I got to get home. ",
        "Kevin: Well, of course you do. Did you like the song? ",
        "Livvie: Got to go. I love you. ",
        "Kevin: Back to crooked avenue, where we all end up. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Tess: Chris. ",
        "Chris: That's right. You must be the lovely Tess. Hi. They \r\nweren't lying -- you're a dead ringer for Livvie, aren't you? ",
        "Tess: Jack? ",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. You know, jack's -- jack's not here. He \r\nactually sent me over to come and get you. You're going to come with me, ok? I'm \r\nChris, Jack's brother, the good guy. Come on. Here, we'll get your coat. Take \r\ncare of that. Good. We're going to go see jack. He's going to meet up with us \r\nlater. Ok? ",
