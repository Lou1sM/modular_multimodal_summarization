        "Jack: Hey, Tess, I\u2019m home! Hey, Tess! I just gave Ian a piece of your hair to \r\nrun the DNA Test. I really think we're doing the right thing. Ok, where are you? \r\nHello? Tess? Ok, you come out now. Tess? Tess, are you here? Damn. Ok, she's not \r\nhere. Where could she have gone? ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Chris: Come in, Tess. It's ok. This is where I live. This is my home. Look \r\nover here, there's some amazing views of the city from up here. ",
        "Tess: Where's Jack? ",
        "Chris: Oh, well, Jack's going to be joining us a little bit later. You know, \r\nyou don't have to be scared of me. I'm Jack's brother, right? Ok, have a seat. \r\nMake yourself comfortable. Would you like something to drink? Maybe some water \r\nor something? No? Ok. Well, you know, I thought maybe we could talk about this \r\nspecial talent you apparently have. You know, that ability to heal people. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Elizabeth: Well, he was seeing that Italian woman during that time that we \r\nwere in Tuscany -- Ciara Perrotti. And she probably still lives in that same \r\nlittle teeny town called Lucca. Oh, God, then there was that French slut when we \r\nwere in Antibes -- Marie Aplomb. And after that trip, we pretty much just went \r\nback to the regular jet-set crowd -- Tracy Coomes, the expat who was at every \r\nsingle solitary party we were. That list could go on forever. Kristin Smith, \r\nEmily Marx, Cynthia Cavender, and my once very dear friend Marla Whittingham, \r\nwho I actually used to confide in about your father's infidelities until I found \r\nout later from him that she was actually one of them. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. He actually told you about this? ",
        "Elizabeth: Your father wasn't exactly discreet about his affairs. He sort of \r\nseemed to take pride in them. Well, except for one. ",
        "Alison: Who's that? ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, it was the woman that he was with before me. The woman that he \r\nsaid he would never stop loving. ",
        "Rafe: He never told you her name? ",
        "Elizabeth: No. No, the only time he ever even brought her up was to pointedly \r\ntell me that I would never compare to her. Apparently, he loved her very much.\r\n",
        "Alison: My God. Well, did -- did he mention anything about her at all? I \r\nmean, did he say where she lived or what she looked like? ",
        "Elizabeth: Uh-uh, no. Unfortunately, if she ends up being the mother of your \r\nsibling, I'm afraid I\u2019m not going to be able to be as much help as you had \r\nhoped. Will you excuse me for a minute? ",
        "Alison: Where are you going? ",
        "Elizabeth: I have to go check my messages. ",
        "Alison: Why? To see if that guy called? ",
        "Elizabeth: Hope springs eternal. ",
        "Alison: Wow. ",
        "Rafe: You ok? ",
        "Alison: This is so weird. ",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: You know what I mean? She's rattling off names that my father slept \r\nwith like she's reading a phone book, like she completely got used to it. ",
        "Rafe: Well, maybe she has. ",
        "Alison: And now she's going to go check to see if some guy called, some guy \r\nshe met in a bar. These are not the things that I thought I would be talking \r\nabout with my mother, at all. You know? ",
        "Rafe: I know. Look, you can stop this whole thing anytime you want, you know \r\nthat. ",
        "Alison: I know, I do, but I really want to find my brother or sister, even if \r\nit means figuring out that my dad was a jerk, which he was. But, you know, she \r\nreally put up with a lot. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, she did, but -- you starting to like her? ",
        "Alison: No. I mean, I wouldn't go that far. I'm starting to maybe understand \r\nher a little bit better, yeah. But I don't know. So, tell me about Stephen Clay.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Well, there's not much to tell. He just appeared out of nowhere. ",
        "Alison: And you didn't see him at all? ",
        "Rafe: No. He wanted to be found but not seen, at least not by me. ",
        "Alison: I wonder why. ",
        "Rafe: When I run into him again -- and I have a feeling I will -- that's the \r\nfirst of a lot of questions I'm going to ask him. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: These are amazing. ",
        "Marissa: Thank you. Thank you. ",
        "Stephen: I knew you'd find the words. ",
        "Marissa: Well, you know, when i heard your music, it just inspired me. ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, well, I think that's what good music should do. Somehow, it \r\nmakes you feel something, even if you don't understand what you feel. ",
        "Marissa: You already knew what you wanted to say, didn't you? You did. I \r\ncould feel every emotion. ",
        "Stephen: Look, while we're here, I want to apologize for Joshua interrupting \r\nyour evening with -- ",
        "Marissa: Jamal. ",
        "Stephen: Jamal -- your boyfriend? ",
        "Marissa: Right, and, you know, and it's totally cool. You just wanted the \r\nsong, and I was being irresponsible, so -- ",
        "Stephen: Well, if irresponsibility gets me words like this, spend as much \r\ntime with Jamal as you'd like. ",
        "Marissa: Thank you. Although, you know, you might want to pass that message \r\nalong to Joshua, because I have this feeling he wishes I didn't have a life. ",
        "Stephen: That's because he doesn't have one outside of the band. I'll take \r\ncare of Joshua. Everybody deserves to have a life. Maybe we could work on the \r\nsecond verse, though. ",
        "Marissa: Oh, ok. ",
        "Stephen: I like this line. ",
        "Reese: Look, Ricky, stop, please -- ",
        "Ricky: I don't want to hear it. ",
        "Reese: Just a second -- ",
        "Ricky: Marissa, I told you before, I didn't need your pity. ",
        "Marissa: Ricky, what -- ",
        "Ricky: And that's how I got this job? I'm not a charity case here, ok? You \r\nwent ahead and you made me look like a fool! ",
        "Marissa: Look, I'm sorry, Ricky -- ",
        "Ricky: I don't want to hear it. If I would've known that that's how I got \r\nthis job, I would've never taken it. I don't need any handouts from you or you. \r\nI quit. ",

        "Jack: Come on, man. All right, come on, come on. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Lucy: Hello? ",
        "Jack: Lucy? Lucy, Tess is gone. ",
        "Lucy: Jack? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, Tess is gone. She's not here. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, take a deep breath, slow down. Tell me \r\nwhat is happening? ",
        "Jack: Look, I just got back from the hospital and she wasn't here. I left her \r\nhere. I knew I shouldn't have left her alone, but she was here. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, listen to me, settle down. Do you think maybe she took herself for \r\na little walk or maybe -- ",
        "Jack: No -- no, no, no. She wouldn't leave. She promised me she would stay \r\nright here. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, think. Where else could she be? ",
        "Jack: There's only one thing that makes sense, Lucy -- someone took her. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Chris: So, Tess, tell me, when did you first realize you had this ability to \r\nheal people? Because it really is an amazing gift, you know. ",
        "Tess: Don't know. ",
        "Chris: Don't know, huh? You don't remember the first person you were able to \r\nheal? Because I do. And that's the funny thing -- you know, you and I have a lot \r\nin common, because I\u2019m a doctor and I heal people. Of course, I have to, you \r\nknow, rely on modern medicine and science to do that. But you, you know, it's \r\ndifferent with you. With you, it's innate. It's something inside that makes you \r\nvery, very special. ",
        "Tess: I don't want to be special. ",
        "Chris: Oh, no, but you are, Tess. You're very special. ",
        "Tess: Jack's coming? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, no, Jack's coming. He'll be here soon. You know, the thing is I \r\nthought maybe you and I could talk a little bit more. You know, what I would \r\nlike to know is, do you feel like there's some sort of an energy inside you that \r\nallows you to heal people? Is that it? ",
        "Tess: How long? ",
        "Chris: Hey, don't be afraid. It's ok. He'll be here soon. Just try to focus \r\nwith me for a second, because I'm so curious. Do you feel like with jack's leg, \r\nor with Ian\u2019s, you know, his wound -- did you feel, like, an energy kind of \r\ntransfer or heat or something or -- or wait, hey, how about afterwards, you \r\nmight've felt tired, right? ",
        "Tess: No, I want Jack. ",
        "Chris: I know you want Jack. That's ok, I know. But right now, it's just you \r\nand me. ",

        "Marissa: Ricky -- Ricky wait -- ",
        "Ricky: I'm gone. ",
        "Marissa: Wait -- look, I know you're mad at me. You have every right to be \r\nmad at me, but look, just don't leave this band, ok? ",
        "Ricky: Why, Marissa? Huh? Because you need a buddy? Or because you need to \r\nshow everybody how much juice you got with the big boss -- ",
        "Marissa: No, no, because I know how talented you are. ",
        "Stephen: Get him out of here. ",
        "Reese: I've tried to, Stephen. He's really pissed off. ",
        "Stephen: And so am I. We don't have time for this. ",
        "Ricky: I'm flattered. ",
        "Marissa: Well, you should be because it's true. ",
        "Stephen: Hey, look, what do you say we do this after rehearsal? You are not \r\nquitting anything, and you still have a song to work on. ",
        "Marissa: It's fine by me. ",
        "Ricky: And who the hell do you think you are? ",
        "Stephen: The name's on your bass drum, Ricky. Why don't you go back and give \r\nit a kick? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, yeah, that's right, wait -- \"Stephen Clay,\" right? \"The mystery \r\nman.\" ",
        "Marissa: Ricky -- ",

        "Alison: So do you think that Stephen Clay ran into you on purpose at the gym?\r\n",
        "Rafe: I think so. I don't know. ",
        "Alison: Wait, everything about this band is really starting to bug you, isn't \r\nit? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, it is. Too much. All this weird stuff I\u2019m talking about, it's too \r\nmuch. It's too much for you. ",
        "Alison: At? No, it's not. No, Rafe, I want to hear about it. ",
        "Rafe: No, you don\u2019t. ",
        "Alison: Yes, I do. ",
        "Rafe: You don't, and I don't blame you. You had your whole parents' sordid \r\nhistory dumped in your lap, and you're looking for some brother or sister you \r\nnever knew you had, and I'm talking about weird vibes and strange, crazy rock \r\n'n' roll stars. I -- you know what? Let's talk about something else. Let's talk \r\nabout basketball. ",
        "Alison: You don't know anything about basketball. ",
        "Rafe: I do, too. ",
        "Alison: No, you don\u2019t. You're sweet, but you don\u2019t. ",
        "Rafe: No, I don\u2019t. ",
        "Alison: No, you don\u2019t. ",
        "Rafe: But I could learn. You know, I -- hey, hey, you know what? I just \r\nthought of this -- I can learn anything if I just concentrate on what's right in \r\nfront of me. ",
        "Alison: Which is -- ",

        "Stephen: That's right. ",
        "Marissa: No, Stephen, don't -- ",
        "Stephen: And of course, you wouldn't be much of a drummer, would you? ",
        "Marissa: Ricky didn't mean it. It was an accident. ",
        "Stephen: Well, then Ricky needs to learn to be more careful, right, Ricky? He \r\nshould also learn how lucky he is to be in this band. ",
        "Reese: Yeah, that's right. This is a once-in-a-lifetime -- ",
        "Stephen: Enough, Reese. ",
        "Ricky: I didn't mean to push you. ",
        "Marissa: No, I messed up, ok? I messed up, Ricky. Look, you should've been a \r\npart of this all along. ",
        "Stephen: Doesn't matter why you're in the band, Ricky. The fact is you're in \r\nit. And you're not leaving. Tonight is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for all \r\nof us, and I don't intend to blow it. Understand? ",
        "Reese: What do you need us to do? ",
        "Stephen: Get over to the stage and get ready. I'll take care of the rest. \r\nRicky? ",
        "Ricky: What? ",
        "Stephen: There's a lot at stake, man, and sometimes my temper gets the best \r\nof me. I'm sorry. ",
        "Ricky: It's cool. ",
        "Stephen: Come here. ",
        "Stephen: You ever challenge me like that in front of my crew again, I\u2019ll not \r\nonly break your hand, I\u2019ll rip your whole arm off. So you can decide -- do you \r\nwant to make history with me? Or do you want to try to find a job as a one-armed \r\ndrummer? ",

        "Lucy: Hey, ok, listen, I thought of this -- what about the cave? Did you \r\ncheck the cave? ",
        "Jack: First thing, and Tess wasn't there. ",
        "Lucy: All right, I drove a little slow just to see if maybe she was walking \r\nwhile I was -- I didn't see here anywhere on the road. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, I know someone has her -- Livvie. Livvie hates her -- ",
        "Lucy: No, no. No, no, wait. I know for a fact Livvie doesn't have her. ",
        "Jack: Why not? ",
        "Lucy: Because Livvie\u2019s visiting her father. ",
        "Jack: All right, ok, ok, ok. If Livvie doesn't have her, then maybe someone \r\nelse -- what if word got out about her healing powers? ",
        "Lucy: But how could -- no, no, I -- Ian and I certainly didn't tell anybody. \r\nDid you tell anybody? No. ",
        "Jack: Well, maybe it leaked out at the hospital when, you know, about healing \r\nBrennan and Ian and -- people talk, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I know talk. Come on, I know gossip at general hospital. I didn't hear \r\nanything about Ian or Brennan. Did you tell anybody at all about your leg? ",
        "Jack: Only Jamal and my brother. ",
        "Jack and Lucy: Chris. ",
        "Jack: Let's go. ",

        "Chris: Tess, there's nothing to be afraid of. I keep telling you, Jack will \r\nbe here soon. I just want to talk. You know, I'm sorry about asking all these \r\nquestions, but you have to understand that as a doctor, I\u2019m fascinated by this \r\nability you apparently have to heal people. ",
        "Tess: I want to go. ",
        "Chris: No, wait, wait, just be patient. Be patient. I -- I just want to try \r\nthis out. I want to find out if this gift of yours is for real. ",
        "Tess: No -- ",
        "Chris: It's ok. It's just going to be a simple scientific experiment, that's \r\nall. ",
        "Tess: What -- what are you doing? ",
        "Chris: Well, I'm going to make a very small cut in my arm. And I want to see \r\nif you can heal it. Ok? It's just an experiment, no big deal. Here we go. ",
        "Chris: Hey, don't cry, it's ok. It's just a small cut. ",
        "Tess: Oh -- ",
        "Chris: Doesn't even hurt, I promise. ",
        "Tess: Why? ",
        "Chris: Why? Well, I just want to see if you can heal it. Tess, can you heal \r\nit? ",
        "Tess: I can fix you, but this is very bad. To hurt yourself is bad. You hurt \r\nyourself all the time. Why do you do that? ",
        "Chris: What? ",
        "Tess: You feel bad all the time. In here. ",
        "Chris: How did you know that? ",
        "Tess: Don't feel sad anymore. ",
        "Chris: Will you help me? ",

        "Ricky: Don't, Marissa. You want to know the real reason why I'm staying in \r\nthe band? It's not because you begged me. And it's not because Stephen told me \r\nto. It's because I\u2019m going to show you all that I\u2019m not a charity case, all \r\nright? ",
        "Marissa: Oh, Ricky -- Ricky, I never said you were a charity case. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, obviously you did because you called in a favor. But you \r\nknow what? Even if that's how I got the job, I\u2019m going to show you all that I \r\ndeserve it. I'm going to show you, Stephen, and the whole world. ",
