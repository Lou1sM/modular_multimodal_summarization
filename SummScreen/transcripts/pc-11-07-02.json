I just gave Ian a piece of your hair to run the DNA Test. I really think we're doing the right thing. Ok, where are you? Hello? Tess? Ok, you come out now. Tess? Tess, are you here? Damn. Ok, she's not here. Where could she have gone? ", "****************************************************************************************************", "Chris: Come in, Tess. It's ok. This is where I live. This is my home. Look over here, there's some amazing views of the city from up here. ", "Tess: Where's Jack? ", "Chris: Oh, well, Jack's going to be joining us a little bit later. You know, you don't have to be scared of me. I'm Jack's brother, right? Ok, have a seat. Make yourself comfortable. Would you like something to drink? Maybe some water or something? No? Ok. Well, you know, I thought maybe we could talk about this special talent you apparently have. You know, that ability to heal people. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "****************************************************************************************************", "Elizabeth: Well, he was seeing that Italian woman during that time that we were in Tuscany -- Ciara Perrotti. And she probably still lives in that same little teeny town called Lucca. Oh, God, then there was that French slut when we were in Antibes -- Marie Aplomb. And after that trip, we pretty much just went back to the regular jet-set crowd -- Tracy Coomes, the expat who was at every single solitary party we were. That list could go on forever. Kristin Smith, Emily Marx, Cynthia Cavender, and my once very dear friend Marla Whittingham, who I actually used to confide in about your father's infidelities until I found out later from him that she was actually one of them. ", "Alison: Oh, my God. He actually told you about this? ", "Elizabeth: Your father wasn't exactly discreet about his affairs. He sort of seemed to take pride in them. Well, except for one. ", "Alison: Who's that? ", "Elizabeth: Oh, it was the woman that he was with before me. The woman that he said he would never stop loving. ", "Rafe: He never told you her name? ", "Elizabeth: No. No, the only time he ever even brought her up was to pointedly tell me that I would never compare to her. Apparently, he loved her very much.", "Alison: My God. Well, did -- did he mention anything about her at all? I mean, did he say where she lived or what she looked like? ", "Elizabeth: Uh-uh, no. Unfortunately, if she ends up being the mother of your sibling, I'm afraid I\u2019m not going to be able to be as much help as you had hoped. Will you excuse me for a minute? ", "Alison: Where are you going? ", "Elizabeth: I have to go check my messages. ", "Alison: Why? To see if that guy called? ", "Elizabeth: Hope springs eternal. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Wow. ", "Rafe: You ok? ", "Alison: This is so weird. ", "Rafe: Mm-hmm. ", "Alison: You know what I mean? She's rattling off names that my father slept with like she's reading a phone book, like she completely got used to it. ", "Rafe: Well, maybe she has. ", "Alison: And now she's going to go check to see if some guy called, some guy she met in a bar. These are not the things that I thought I would be talking about with my mother, at all. You know? ", "Rafe: I know. Look, you can stop this whole thing anytime you want, you know that. ", "Alison: I know, I do, but I really want to find my brother or sister, even if it means figuring out that my dad was a jerk, which he was. But, you know, she really put up with a lot. ", "Rafe: Yeah, she did, but -- you starting to like her? ", "Alison: No. I mean, I wouldn't go that far. I'm starting to maybe understand her a little bit better, yeah. But I don't know. So, tell me about Stephen Clay.", "Rafe: Well, there's not much to tell. He just appeared out of nowhere. ", "Alison: And you didn't see him at all? ", "Rafe: No. He wanted to be found but not seen, at least not by me. ", "Alison: I wonder why. ", "Rafe: When I run into him again -- and I have a feeling I will -- that's the first of a lot of questions I'm going to ask him. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "****************************************************************************************************", "Stephen: These are amazing. ", "Marissa: Thank you. Thank you. ", "Stephen: I knew you'd find the words. ", "Marissa: Well, you know, when i heard your music, it just inspired me. ", "Stephen: Yeah, well, I think that's what good music should do. Somehow, it makes you feel something, even if you don't understand what you feel. ", "Marissa: You already knew what you wanted to say, didn't you? You did. I could feel every emotion. ", "Stephen: Look, while we're here, I want to apologize for Joshua interrupting your evening with -- ", "Marissa: Jamal. ", "Stephen: Jamal -- your boyfriend? ", "Marissa: Right, and, you know, and it's totally cool. You just wanted the song, and I was being irresponsible, so -- ", "Stephen: Well, if irresponsibility gets me words like this, spend as much time with Jamal as you'd like. ", "Marissa: Thank you. Although, you know, you might want to pass that message along to Joshua, because I have this feeling he wishes I didn't have a life. ", "Stephen: That's because he doesn't have one outside of the band. I'll take care of Joshua. Everybody deserves to have a life. Maybe we could work on the second verse, though. ", "Marissa: Oh, ok. ", "Stephen: I like this line. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reese: Look, Ricky, stop, please -- ", "Ricky: I don't want to hear it. ", "Reese: Just a second -- ", "Ricky: Marissa, I told you before, I didn't need your pity. ", "Marissa: Ricky, what -- ", "Ricky: And that's how I got this job? I'm not a charity case here, ok? You went ahead and you made me look like a fool! ", "Marissa: Look, I'm sorry, Ricky -- ", "Ricky: I don't want to hear it. If I would've known that that's how I got this job, I would've never taken it. I don't need any handouts from you or you. I quit.

Wait, wait, take a deep breath, slow down. Tell me what is happening? ", "Jack: Look, I just got back from the hospital and she wasn't here. I left her here. I knew I shouldn't have left her alone, but she was here. ", "Lucy: Ok, listen to me, settle down. Do you think maybe she took herself for a little walk or maybe -- ", "Jack: No -- no, no, no. She wouldn't leave. She promised me she would stay right here. ", "Lucy: Ok, think. Where else could she be? ", "Jack: There's only one thing that makes sense, Lucy -- someone took her.

Because it really is an amazing gift, you know. ", "Tess: Don't know. ", "Chris: Don't know, huh? You don't remember the first person you were able to heal? Because I do. And that's the funny thing -- you know, you and I have a lot in common, because I\u2019m a doctor and I heal people. Of course, I have to, you know, rely on modern medicine and science to do that. But you, you know, it's different with you. With you, it's innate. It's something inside that makes you very, very special. ", "Tess: I don't want to be special. ", "Chris: Oh, no, but you are, Tess. You're very special. ", "Tess: Jack's coming? ", "Chris: Yeah, no, Jack's coming. He'll be here soon. You know, the thing is I thought maybe you and I could talk a little bit more. You know, what I would like to know is, do you feel like there's some sort of an energy inside you that allows you to heal people? Is that it? ", "Tess: How long? ", "Chris: Hey, don't be afraid. It's ok. He'll be here soon. Just try to focus with me for a second, because I'm so curious. Do you feel like with jack's leg, or with Ian\u2019s, you know, his wound -- did you feel, like, an energy kind of transfer or heat or something or -- or wait, hey, how about afterwards, you might've felt tired, right?

Or because you need to show everybody how much juice you got with the big boss -- ", "Marissa: No, no, because I know how talented you are. ", "Stephen: Get him out of here. ", "Reese: I've tried to, Stephen. He's really pissed off. ", "Stephen: And so am I. We don't have time for this. ", "Ricky: I'm flattered. ", "Marissa: Well, you should be because it's true.

It's too much for you. ", "Alison: At? No, it's not. No, Rafe, I want to hear about it. ", "Rafe: No, you don\u2019t. ", "Alison: Yes, I do. ", "Rafe: You don't, and I don't blame you. You had your whole parents' sordid history dumped in your lap, and you're looking for some brother or sister you never knew you had, and I'm talking about weird vibes and strange, crazy rock 'n' roll stars. I -- you know what? Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about basketball. ", "Alison: You don't know anything about basketball. ", "Rafe: I do, too. ", "Alison: No, you don\u2019t.

Did you tell anybody? No. ", "Jack: Well, maybe it leaked out at the hospital when, you know, about healing Brennan and Ian and -- people talk, Lucy. ", "Lucy: I know talk. Come on, I know gossip at general hospital. I didn't hear anything about Ian or Brennan. Did you tell anybody at all about your leg? ", "Jack: Only Jamal and my brother. ", "Jack and Lucy: Chris.
