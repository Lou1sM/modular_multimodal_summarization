        "Ian: What? ",
        "Colleen: You just had a knife stuck in your chest. ",
        "Ian: Ah -- ",
        "Colleen: You know, even Braveheart had to take a rest. Now, why don't you \r\njust go back to your room -- ",
        "Ian: Braveheart was from Scotland. I don't need any rest, thank you. ",
        "Colleen: Fine. ",
        "Lucy: Ian? ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Jack: Tess is gone. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Lucy: Chris kidnapped her. ",
        "Ian: He kidnapped her? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, somehow he got ahold of her and took her to his apartment, and \r\nshe got away from him and now we don't know where she is. We can't find her. ",
        "Jack: And we searched everywhere she knows. ",
        "Lucy: She knows G.H. We're here for -- ",
        "Jack: And we searched every floor. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Ian: Well, she's not here. You would've seen her, I'm sorry. ",
        "Jack: Oh, man. I got to find her. ",

        "Livvie: Home. Finally away from that creepy hospital. No wonder my dad's \r\ngetting such weird ideas about other people's personalities, going on and on \r\nabout everybody's other. Hmm. \"Free concert tonight in the park, the Stephen \r\nClay Experience.\" Why not. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************************************",
        "Rafe: This guy Stephen Clay, he's been playing games with us ever since he \r\ngot here. ",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sure that he must have said something about his music or \r\nmaybe why he's here in Port Charles. ",
        "Elizabeth: Look, you guys, I've told you everything I know. We hadn't even \r\nexchanged names before now. I only found out in this last conversation that he \r\nis Stephen Clay. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, then tell us again from the beginning because everything you know \r\nthat we don't know is something, ok? ",
        "Elizabeth: You know, this is just ridiculous! ",
        "Alison: No, mother, please, I'm serious. ",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, ok. He's in a band, they're having a concert tonight in the \r\npark, and he would love for us to come. That's it. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, and he specifically said -- ",
        "Elizabeth: For myself, my daughter, and her fianc\u00e9e -- which, if you ask me, \r\nis actually very nice for you guys to be included. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, you know what? Let's just all sit back and think about this for \r\njust a second, all right? Now, of all the people to start something up with you \r\n-- I mean, this guy could hook up with about a million different women. He \r\npicked you? ",
        "Elizabeth: Excuse me! ",
        "Alison: Well, she's a very beautiful woman. ",
        "Rafe: All right -- ",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you, Alison. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok -- ",
        "Alison: You're welcome. ",
        "Rafe: You know what? I didn't mean that exactly the way it came out. It just \r\nseems a bit coincidental, don't you think? ",
        "Elizabeth: I think that you are getting really paranoid, and for no good \r\nreason. ",
        "Alison: Wait -- ok, wait, where are you going now? ",
        "Elizabeth: I am going to go and slink into the tightest, sexiest little dress \r\nthat I can find, no buts about it. I have a personal invitation for this \r\nevening, so with or without the two of you, I'm going to the ball. ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok. Don't you think that maybe she has just a little point, maybe \r\neven just a little bit? ",
        "Rafe: No, I don\u2019t. Look at her -- ",
        "Alison: You're the one -- Rafe, you are the who just said that you were going \r\nto put aside all of your bad vibes and start smelling the roses. ",
        "Rafe: Right. Smell the roses. But I'm telling you, whatever this clown is up \r\nto -- ",
        "Alison: We're going to find out tonight. ",
        "Rafe: We're going? ",
        "Alison: Well, what do you think? ",

        "Joshua: Just as you requested. ",
        "Stephen: Always count on you, Joshua. ",
        "Joshua: Always at your service. ",
        "Stephen: Reese, I want every guy's tongue dragging on the ground when you hit \r\nthat stage. Can you handle that? ",
        "Reese: No problem. ",
        "Stephen: Lovely Marissa, whose words will announce our arrival? ",
        "Marissa: I'm nervous. ",
        "Stephen: You've done your work. It's time for the rest of us to put it \r\nacross. Right, Ricky? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, rock 'n' roll, man. ",
        "Stephen: Rock 'n' roll. Because the time's finally come for the people of \r\nPort Charles to see the real Stephen Clay Experience. ",

        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Wait, wait just a minute. What are you doing? Where are \r\nyou going? ",
        "Jack: Lucy, I have to go find Tess. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm going with you. ",
        "Jack: No, no, you're going to stay here. I can cover more ground by myself. \r\nBesides, you need to be here just in case she comes here. ",
        "Lucy: No, I want to help you. ",
        "Jack: Lucy, she needs to see a friendly face, a friendly person, ok? ",
        "Ian: If she shows up, we'll take care of her, ok? ",
        "Jack: Good, thank you. ",
        "Lucy: Fine, but you're going to call me if you hear anything. ",
        "Ian: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: I'll do the same, ok? ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, good luck. ",
        "Jack: Bye. ",
        "Lucy: Bye. Oh. ",
        "Ian: What's up with Chris? He's put his nose in everything. Now he's \r\nkidnapping people? ",
        "Lucy: You -- you didn't see him. ",
        "Ian: What's that mean? ",
        "Lucy: It means it wasn't really like Chris. It was different. He was kind of \r\nsweet, you know, and he had tears in his eyes. He was very upset and -- he \r\nthinks Tess is some sort of miracle. ",
        "Ian: So Tess is healing souls now, is she? ",
        "Lucy: I guess you just had to be there. ",
        "Ian: Ahem. ",
        "Lucy: Did you get the DNA Results? ",
        "Ian: No, I didn't. You know, I don't know if they would make any difference \r\nanyway. ",
        "Lucy: What is that supposed to mean? ",
        "Ian: Even if Tess has these healing powers, doesn't mean they're going to \r\nshow up on her DNA Markers. ",
        "Lucy: Right. But we get to find out if Livvie and Tess are related, not that \r\nI can stand the thought of that. I also can't stand this. I don't do this good. \r\nI don't stand around waiting for something -- maybe there's a message. Maybe she \r\nsomehow got -- Colleen? Hi, do I have any messages of any kind? ",
        "Colleen: Uh, a flyer, that's all. ",
        "Lucy: I got a flyer? Great, to some band I -- oh, my gosh. Ian? ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Lucy: The name of this band. ",
        "Ian: What is it? ",

        "Rafe: You don't know this band, do you? ",
        "Elizabeth: No, I -- my circle of friends listen to music that would put you \r\nto sleep. This is -- this is fantastic! Look at all these people. Oh, I can't \r\nbelieve I'm dating a rock star. ",
        "Alison: Now they're dating. She's dating him now. ",

        "Guard: Yeah, well, Mr. Clay says nobody gets back there no matter what -- no \r\npress, no friends, no way. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but she's with the band, so I think her word is better than \r\nyours, so -- ",

        "Guard: No. ",
        "Marissa: Rafe, Rafe, Rafe, it's not going to happen, trust me. You know, \r\nStephen has this thing about privacy, so no one sees him except us. ",
        "Rafe: Privacy? The guy's giving a concert in 15 minutes. ",
        "Marissa: And he's shy. He's not even going to show his face. ",
        "Rafe: I really don't think this guy's as shy as you think. ",
        "Marissa: Well, I happen to know him pretty good, so -- ",
        "Rafe: Ok, so why here, why now? I mean, if this guy's not showing his face -- \r\nhe's showing it a lot, Marissa. He showed it to you, he showed it to Ricky, he \r\nthrew a big party for the whole town, now he's going to be in a concert. ",
        "Marissa: Well, I don't know, maybe he's trying to break out of his shell or \r\nsomething. ",
        "Rafe: So what does he look like? ",
        "Marissa: Excuse me? ",
        "Rafe: What does he look like? Is he tall, is he short? What are his eyes, \r\nbrown, blue? ",
        "Marissa: I'm not hot for the guy, Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Brown hair? ",
        "Marissa: I don't know. Why do you even care what he looks like? ",
        "Rafe: I care because everything this guy does, everywhere he goes, everyone \r\nhe meets, it's calculated. Now, he's up to something, and I want to know what it \r\nis. ",

        "Alison: Well, you did spend over 20 years with him. ",
        "Elizabeth: 20 sad years. Alison, I need this. Stephen has given me the most \r\nattention that I\u2019ve gotten in years. And he's a rock star. I mean, after all \r\nthose years of country club and yachting and boring gossip, this is just so \r\namazing. It's -- ",

        "Elizabeth: You know, Alison, just try, ok, just try not to hate me for \r\neverything I do. ",

        "Elizabeth: Well, that's -- that's progress. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. So what is he like? ",
        "Elizabeth: In bed? ",
        "Alison: No! No, no, I -- why would I want to know that? Why? I'm saying, \r\nlike, what is he like? ",
        "Elizabeth: He's warm, he's charming, he's so sensitive. He's funny, sexy --\r\n",
        "Alison: Did he also hang the moon when he hung those stars, huh? ",
        "Elizabeth: You asked. ",
        "Alison: So how old is he? ",
        "Elizabeth: Meaning am I robbing the cradle? Is he your age? I don't know. I'd \r\nsay he's -- ageless. ",
        "Alison: Right. Well, thank you so much for being so specific. ",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you for being interested. And I -- I mean that. I mean, \r\nmaybe it's just wishful thinking or fantasy, but if I didn't know better, I'd \r\nthink that maybe you cared a little bit. ",
        "Alison: Well, it's just that this guy's had a very big effect on you and you \r\ndon't even really know him. ",
        "Elizabeth: I know. I know. I can't explain it. Stephen Clay is just -- well, \r\nhe's like no one I\u2019ve ever met before. ",

        "Ian: No, not yet. What were you going to do, Ramsey? What, take her on the \r\nroad, make her part of a sideshow? ",
        "Chris: It probably would've been classier and more profitable than that, but, \r\nyeah, you're on the right track. ",

        "Chris: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't anything like what happened to you. It \r\nwas just a little cut right -- right there. And she made it go away. It was \r\nnothing serious-- I just wanted to see if she had these powers. The cut was like \r\nmore of an afterthought to her. She -- she did something to me. She -- she, \r\nlike, healed me on the inside. I can't explain it. Don't look at me like that. \r\nIt's just -- I don't know what she did, but it was like she could look inside \r\nme. She saw who I was and how I felt and all the things I\u2019ve done. I mean, I'm \r\ntelling you, I felt ashamed to be in the same room with this girl. But she made \r\nthe hurt go away. ",
        "Ian: I've known you for a while. I've never heard you talk like this. ",

        "Ian: Hang on, what are -- what are you saying? I should throw this out \r\nwithout finding out where she's from, where she got those powers? Is that what \r\nyou're saying to me? ",
        "Chris: I'm telling you, you don't want to know and I don't want to know. \r\nMaybe we -- we shouldn't know. You open that, you're going to regret it. Let it \r\ngo. ",
