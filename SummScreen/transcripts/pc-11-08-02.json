It was just a little cut right -- right there. And she made it go away. It was nothing serious-- I just wanted to see if she had these powers. The cut was like more of an afterthought to her. She -- she did something to me. She -- she, like, healed me on the inside. I can't explain it. Don't look at me like that. It's just -- I don't know what she did, but it was like she could look inside me. She saw who I was and how I felt and all the things I\u2019ve done.
