        "Ian: Caleb. ",
        "Stephen: Hello, Port Charles. I'm Stephen Clay. ",
        "Ian: No. That can't be. ",
        "Colleen: Ian? What is it? What's wrong? ",
        "Ian: Listen -- go find Danny. He's in the daycare center. Go find him now. ",
        "Colleen: Of course, but -- ",
        "Ian: Don't let anyone near him, please! ",
        "Colleen: Ian -- ",
        "Ian: Don't let him out of your sight! ",
        "Colleen: You can't leave. You're a patient. ",
        "Ian: I'm not a patient here. Go! Go! How did you do that, Caleb? I saw you die. How did you do this? ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: Are you going places? See the world through naked eyes does the truth bring peace of mind? ",
        "Stephen: Are you happy baby? ",
        "Livvie: No, this can't be happening. I killed you. ",
        "Stephen: Are you down with your old friends? Have you spent your common sense? ",
        "Stephen: Clear white lines draw the straightest path to the main street of life that awaits you, and leave behind your lies if you wanna walk, babe I will walk with you to the freak show we created, if you really wanna do ",
        "Jack: Oh, my God. What's he doing? No. No. Tess, no. Don't let him touch you! ",
        "Stephen: The world through naked eyes ",
        "Alison: Wait, Rafe, no! Don't! ",
        "Lucy: Rafe! ",
        "Elizabeth: What's going on? Why is everybody acting so strange? Where did Rafe go? ",
        "Alison: Mother, don't you know who you're sleeping with? ",
        "Stephen: No more hesitating ",
        "security guard: No one's allowed. Oh! ",
        "Stephen: On this crooked avenue the answer's deep inside of you yeah, yeah ",
        "Rafe: Caleb Morley! ",
        "Stephen: Hey. Hey, stop the music. ",
        "[Music stops] ",
        "[Boos and jeers] ",
        "Stephen: Hey, buddy, if you want an autograph, you're going to have to wait. ",
        "Rafe: I got to hand it to you. It's a great disguise -- a mysterious rock 'n' roll star. That's pretty good. ",
        "Stephen: I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm Stephen Clay. ",
        "[Cheers] ",
        "Stephen: Security, get this guy out of here. Sorry, folks. This guy's had a few too many. ",
        "Rafe: This ends now! ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Jack: Just get in. Get in right now, ok? ",
        "Tess: Why, Jack? What -- ",
        "Jack: Don't ask why right now, I'll explain later. I'll explain, but you got to listen to everything I say. We're going to lock all the windows. And we got to make sure all the doors are locked. Ok. Look, I know you don't know what just happened. ",
        "Tess: I liked the music. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no. The music -- the music is very bad. The guy up on stage is a very bad guy, Tess. He's hurt a lot of people, including me, and he will hurt you, too. ",
        "Tess: No. Stephen is nice. ",
        "Jack: No. \"Nice\"? ",
        "Tess: To me. Nice to me. ",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa. Ok, hold on, hold on. You know this guy? When did he talk to you, Tess? You got to tell me. You got to talk to me, ok? ",
        "Tess: In the -- in the car and, oh, he wanted to give me a ride. ",
        "Jack: You mean, the other day when I found you -- the black car -- he was the -- oh, my God, he tried to take you. ",
        "Tess: Take me? ",
        "Jack: He tried to take you. Tess -- Tess, you got to listen to me. You can never go near that guy again. He's a dangerous guy. ",
        "Never go near him again. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: Hey, grab him! ",
        "Rafe: Son of a bitch! ",
        "Stephen: Get him off me! ",
        "Rafe: I'm going to send you right back to where you came from! ",
        "Stephen: Bakersfield? What are you talking about? ",
        "Ricky: What the hell are you doing, Rafe? ",
        "Rafe: I will kill you before you hurt anyone else! ",
        "Crowd: Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! ",
        "Joshua: Port Charles police? ",
        "Crowd: Stephen! Stephen! ",
        "Joshua: I'm at the Stephen Clay concert in the park. There's been an incident -- Mr. Clay's been attacked. ",
        "Alison: I don't see him. Is Rafe hurt? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Ian, thank God you're here. Rafe is up there on the stage. ",
        "Ian: I know. Come on. ",
        "Alison: Wait, Lucy, I want to come with you. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, you're not. ",
        "Alison: Get your hands off me, mother! ",
        "Joshua: The police are on the way. ",
        "Stephen: Good, because this guy is a lunatic. ",
        "Rafe: You can play dumb all you want, but I know who you really are, Caleb! ",
        "Stephen: This guy is out of here, man, I'm sorry. Hey, folks, we got a little situation up here. Obviously, this guy lost it a little bit, but -- ",
        "security guard: Hey! ",
        "Stephen: We'll be sure to -- ",
        "Rafe: Everybody you got to listen to me! This man -- he isn't who he says he is! He is not Stephen Clay! His is name is Caleb Morley, and he's a vampire! ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Livvie: I know it was him, it was Caleb, but how? I killed him a long time ago. God, it doesn't matter. I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here before he finds me. Oh, god, please. Come on! Come on, get in the lock. Agh. ",
        "Caleb's voice: Olivia. I love you. ",
        "Livvie: Again. ",
        "Caleb: I love you. ",
        "Livvie: No more! God, how can this be happening? ",
        "God, how? You were dead, Caleb! God, you were dead. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Elizabeth: Get your psycho boyfriend to stop. He's ruining the concert. ",
        "Alison: Shut up, mother. ",
        "Rafe: You got to believe me! It's true! His name is Caleb Morley and he is a vampire! ",
        "Stephen: Did you just call me a vampire? A vampire? ",
        "Lucy: This crowd is going to lynch him. ",
        "Ian: I know. ",
        "Lucy: Do something. ",
        "Rafe: It's true! ",
        "Reese: Yeah, let's see you fly, boss. ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, you want to see my wings? How about these right here? See my teeth? You like that? ",
        "Ian: Rafe? ",
        "Stephen: I don't know. Maybe we'll work you into the show full-time, man -- the crazy guy that jumps out of the crowd and starts talking stuff about vampires. ",
        "Joshua: Stephen, I think perhaps we should -- ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, of course. Hey, folks, you've been great, but we're going to take a little break here, clean this mess up. We're going to come back, we're going to party. Just give us five. ",
        "[Cheers and applause] ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, how proud you must be. Is Rafe on any kind of medication? ",
        "Alison: Mother, you do not know what you're talking about. ",
        "Elizabeth: You wanted to ask me if I knew who I was sleeping with. I should be asking you that. Vampires? Come on. ",
        "Stephen: What am I going to do with you? ",
        "Rafe: You haven't figured that out yet, Caleb? You've orchestrated everything else. ",
        "Stephen: This Caleb guy must be some piece of work. I gather I look like him. ",
        "Ian: You look a lot like him. ",
        "Lucy: In fact, you're identical. ",
        "Stephen: I take it you two are friends of this nut job? ",
        "Rafe: I know it's you, Caleb, and I'll prove it. ",
        "Stephen: The only thing you've done so far is ruin a good time for a lot of people. ",
        "Rafe: You're just toying with us. ",
        "Stephen: Oh, now I have, what, a master plan? ",
        "Rafe: That's wt t you were doing. That's what you were doing at the Halloween party and when you saw me at the gym. ",
        "Stephen: What are you, some kind of stalker? You're exactly the kind of person I've tried to avoid my entire career. You're the reason why I haven't shown my face all this time. ",
        "Joshua: Officers, arrest this man. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. Andy, hi. How's it going? Good to see you. I -- I want to vouch for my cousin here. ",
        "Joshua: And who's going to vouch for you? ",
        "Andy: All right, guys, just everybody hold on, all right just relax. Ian, are you involved in this, too? ",
        "Ian: She's telling the truth. ",
        "Lucy: It's just -- what this is, is a horrible mistake, just a little misunderstanding. It's my cousin's -- he's got this love of these types of rock 'n' roll bands. He just got a little overcaffeinated and he'd been telling me for weeks about this band called the vampires, and the lead singer just happens to be a guy named Caleb Morley. ",
        "Andy: Oh, what -- what are you talking -- ",
        "Lucy: It's the truth. I -- I swear. Isn't it, cousin? Come on, you've been telling me about this band, a bunch of scary, kind of freaky-looking musicians dressed in black, which, I think, could be almost any rock 'n' roll band around, right? I mean, that's you guys, right? ",
        "Stephen: Is that supposed to be a compliment? ",
        "Joshua: Now, whoever you are, I can assure you that we -- ",
        "Lucy: I can assure you that if you do what you're doing, then this man will go to prison, and I don't think you want that. I don't think you want to be inside for a very long time. I don't think you want that, do you, now? ",
        "Stephen: Is that it, bro? You just got a little buzz and thought we were this other band? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. That must have been it. ",
        "Joshua: Don't try to weasel out of this. This is a very important event and you happened to have ruined it. ",
        "Ian: Put a sock in it. You'll get more publicity from this than you ever would from this horrible music. ",
        "Stephen: Oh, another fan. So, what, you're telling me now you don't think I'm a vampire? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. I mean, we all make mistakes, right? We are human, aren't we? Both of us. ",
        "Andy: Mr. Clay? ",
        "Joshua: My advice to you is to prosecute. ",
        "Lucy: And my advice to you is -- ",
        "Stephen: Officer, I don't want any trouble. Just let him go. Listen to me. You stay away from me, you understand? ",
        "Lucy: Cousin, we're going now. Let's go, shall we? Ta. ",
        "Joshua: Are you sure you still want to go on? ",
        "Stephen: Man, I want to do this thing till dawn. ",
        "Andy: I don't think so, Mr. Clay. I think that's enough for one night. I'm going to shut this concert down. ",
        "Joshua: You can't do that. ",
        "Andy: Yes, I can. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Elizabeth: Just how well do you know him? ",
        "Alison: I know him very well, thank you, and whatever you think of him, you are wrong. ",
        "Andy: Concert's over, folks. ",
        "Elizabeth: You don't want to know what I think, but suffice it to say, you could do much better. ",
        "Alison: Thank you for your advice. Now, I really need to ask you a personal question, ok? ",
        "Elizabeth: What? ",
        "Alison: Ahem. When you were with Stephen, when you we e making love to him, did he bite you? ",
        "Elizabeth: Did Stephen -- ",
        "Alison: I know, I know. I know it sounds stupid, but did he? Did he bite you? ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Rafe: Thanks. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks for what? ",
        "Rafe: Well, for saving me from myself. I walked right into it, didn't I? ",
        "Ian: No. Only people that don't know what he's capable of will blame you for that. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, that's just about everybody, isn't it? I mean, there's only a few of us who were touched by his oh-so-special way of doing things. The rest of the people still think he's Stephen clay and I'm just some idiot who messed up their good time. ",
        "Lucy: No, you are not \"some idiot,\" Rafe. You're a vampire slayer. You could not help yourself. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you know what? My technique could use some work. I mean, I just saw him and I reacted and I couldn't stop. ",
        "Lucy: You were sensing him earlier. Your sense, it sort of built up. I felt the same way. ",
        "Rafe: I did, but not all the way. I mean, I just walked right into his trap just like he probably wanted -- ",
        "Ian: Guys -- excuse me. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Ian: What is this, vampire-slaying talk? I don't get it. What is going on? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, you do. You get it. You understand what I felt before, remember? He heard that music in Canada and I had to come home. I reacted then. ",
        "Rafe: Yes. So did I. Ever since I heard the song in the train with Alison, it's been driving me crazy, and now I know why. ",
        "Ian: And what's going on with this whole rock 'n' roll thing? What is that? ",
        "Rafe: Well, that's a good question. ",
        "Alison: Rafe? ",
        "Rafe: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Hey. Hi. ",
        "Lucy: So, here we go again. ",
        "Ian: Here we go again. ",
        "Lucy: What are you doing? What are you looking for? ",
        "Ian: For Jack and Tess. They were here earlier. ",
        "Lucy: I think Jack took Tess home. You know, Jack left when he saw Caleb because I think he knew that Caleb thought Tess was Livvie. It was like Caleb was reaching out -- or this Stephen -- with his eyes to try and touch her. ",
        "Ian: Like he knew her somehow. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. ",
        "Ian: I got to go find her. ",
        "Lucy: No, wait, wait, wait. Ok, I'll go with you. Jack probably did take Tess home. ",
        "Ian: No. I want you to go home where it's safe, please. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, then I'll call Scott and have him pick up the kids. You're calling me, right? ",
        "Ian: I will. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Ian: All right, Caleb. How do you know Tess? ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Jack: I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. ",
        "Tess: I did a bad thing? ",
        "Jack: No. No, no, no, no. No. I was just -- I was just worried, that's all. ",
        "Tess: You were worried about me? ",
        "Jack: I was scared that I would never see you again. ",
        "Tess: You're not really mad? ",
        "Jack: No, I'm not really mad. I can never be mad at you. ",
        "Tess: Jack -- I -- ",
        "Jack: What? What is it? ",
        "Tess: I love you, Jack. I love you. ",
        "Jack: I love you, too. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Ricky: All right, what just happened back there? ",
        "Marissa: I have no idea. I've never seen Rafe act that crazy before. ",
        "Ricky: This was supposed to be my big night and it turns into a big nothing. ",
        "Reese: Get over yourself, Ricky. ",
        "Ricky: What? ",
        "Reese: This was Stephen\u2019s gig. They're all Stephen\u2019s gigs. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Elizabeth: Joshua, I'm trying to find Stephen. We were supposed to have dinner together after the show. ",
        "Joshua: Stephen has left already. ",
        "Elizabeth: He's gone already? ",
        "Joshua: There was an incident onstage. He was pretty shaken up. If you have an appointment, I suggest you reschedule it. ",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, but -- ",
        "Joshua: Will you excuse  me, please? ",
        "Elizabeth: It was going to be just the two of us. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Alison: I was so scared that he was going to -- ",
        "Rafe: He didn\u2019t. I'm fine. ",
        "Alison: I know, I know, but the police -- they could have -- ",
        "Rafe: No, they didn't press any charges. See, now Stephen Clay gets to be a good guy, and I just get to be a big-time all-around fool. ",
        "Lucy: Stop -- stop being so hard on yourself. Stop beating yourself up over this, ok? ",
        "Alison: Listen to me. Are you positive, are you really sure that that was him? ",
        "Rafe: I think I wouldn't forget a face like that. ",
        "Alison: But it could be a whole look-alike thing again. I mean, look at Livvie and Tess. It is possible, isn't it? You said it yourself -- your instincts were all fouled up as soon as you got back here. ",
        "Rafe: I don't want it to be Caleb, ok? I want it to be some horrible nightmarish coincidence. ",
        "Alison: But you don't think so. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, what did your mother say? ",
        "Alison: She thinks we're all crazy. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, especially me. ",
        "Lucy: Well -- ",
        "Alison: I mean, I had to go ask her why she went to go be with this Stephen or Caleb or whoever he is and then if he bit her. ",
        "Lucy: And? And? ",
        "Rafe: Well, it's not likely, especially now. But it is interesting that he zeroed in on your mother. ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Lucy: Especially since they just -- they both came to town at exactly the same time. ",
        "Alison: I'll ask her. ",
        "Rafe: No. No. No, you won\u2019t. I don't want you anywhere near her because I don't want you near him. ",
        "Alison: No, this is not ok. I know how you feel. She is the only mother that I have. ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Please listen to me. If all of this is going down again, we really need to stick together. I will be careful, but you have to promise me that you will do the same thing. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, but if he shows up, you leave or you call me, all right? ",
        "Alison: I know, I know. I know. I know. Look, there's my mother, ok? Hey. ",
        "Elizabeth: What now, Alison? What does Rafe have in store for us now? Werewolves? Zombies? ",
        "Alison: No, mother, vampires. Right? Just like your new boyfriend. ",
        "Lucy: Do you really think Alison will be ok? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And whatever game it is Caleb\u2019s playing, it's a new one on me, so we better figure out what it is bore it's too late. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Jack: Feels good, doesn't it? ",
        "Tess: Feels so good. ",
        "Jack: Stay with me, Tess, and I'll take care of you. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Jack: Hey, don't -- don't say a word. Come on. Ok, ok, ok, ok. Look, if you have to run, you have to run, ok, but stay -- ",
        "[Knocking] ",
        "Ian: Jack, it's Ian. Open up. ",
        "Jack: Oh, my god. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Jack: I thought you were -- ",
        "Ian: No, it's ok. Is she here? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah. She's here. She's right here. Look, it's Ian. It's ok. It's just Ian. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Jack: Remember Ian? Yeah. He's nice. ",
        "Ian: Hi. ",
        "Tess: Hi. ",
        "Ian: I need to talk to you in private. ",
        "Jack: All right. Ok. Look, I'm just going to go outside and talk to Ian, ok? I'll be right back. You're ok. All right. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Jack: Ok. So what happened back there? Did Rafe take him out, or what? ",
        "Ian: No. According to the rest of the world, who was on the stage tonight was Stephen -- ",
        "Jack: No, no -- we both lived through that. We know who it was. ",
        "Ian: I know. I know. And he seemed to have a very special connection to Tess. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I just found out that he tried to give her a ride a few days ago. Probably thought it was Livvie. Anyway, I just had to get Tess out of there and get her home. ",
        "Ian: What did she say about him? ",
        "Jack: She said he was nice. But Tess would think anybody's nice, so -- Ian, what is it? What's wrong? Talk to me. ",
        "Ian: These are Tess' DNA Results. ",
        "Jack: Oh, good, good. So did you find out that she's Livvie\u2019s twin or -- ",
        "Ian: I don't know what she is. ",
        "Jack: What do you mean, you don't know what she is? ",
        "Ian: According to these tests, she doesn't have any DNA ",
        "Jack: What does that mean? ",
        "Ian: If these tests a correct, then Tess isn't human. ",
        "[Tess hums \"naked eyes\"] ",
