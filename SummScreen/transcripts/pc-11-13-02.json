        "Stephen: Dinner? ",
        "Rafe: You said you were hungry, right? ",
        "Stephen: You're -- ",
        "Rafe: Rafe Kovich. ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, the vampire guy -- ",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, the guy that ruined the concert. He's engaged\r\nto my daughter. ",
        "Stephen: Small world. ",
        "Elizabeth: You know, I already told them that I don't think\r\nthis is a very good idea.  ",
        "Stephen: No, no. Dinner sounds good. You sure you'd be ok with\r\nit? ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah, yeah. Look, I -- I am really sorry about the\r\nway I acted at your show. I really regret that, so I just thought\r\nI would make it up to you by taking you out to -- well, it's this\r\nhot new place in town, Selene's or Seleni's or -- it's so new,\r\nI'm not -- ",
        "Stephen: Seleni's. Yeah. I've eaten at the one in the city. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, so, let's go? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, all right. I believe in second chances. Get\r\nyour things, ladies. ",
        "Elizabeth: Thank you. ",
        "Stephen: Sure you can handle dinner with a vampire? ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah, I'll be fine -- as long as I'm not the main\r\ncourse. ",

        "[Tess hums \"Crooked Avenue\"] ",
        "Livvie: Would you listen to her humming? That's Caleb's song,\r\nJack. She's a monster, just like he is. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, leave her alone, all right? ",
        "Livvie: He brought her here to toy with us -- all of us. ",
        "Jack: Ian, get her out of here. ",
        "Livvie: She's Caleb's. Can't you see that? ",
        "Jack: If you don't shut up, I'm going to throw you out. ",
        "Livvie: But Caleb is out there. ",
        "Ian: We'll be at the loft. ",
        "Jack: All right. ",
        "Tess: No, Jack -- ",
        "Jack: Sweetie, go, go. It's going to be ok. ",
        "Ian: It's ok. ",
        "Jack: You'll be safe with Ian.  ",
        "Livvie: Oh, please. ",
        "Ian: I'll watch her. ",
        "Jack: Yes, I'll come get you tomorrow, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and I'll come get you with a stake in my hand! ",
        "Jack: If you do anything to Tess, I will come after you, and I\r\nwill not be responsible for what I do. ",
        "[Captioning made possible by abc, inc.] ",
        "Livvie: I can't believe you're actually threatening me. ",
        "Jack: Well, if you go after Tess, there won't be just threats.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh, my God. You've fallen in love with her, haven't\r\nyou? ",
        "Jack: I'm not discussing tess with you, Livvie. Just leave her\r\nalone, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Fine, then. Let's discuss Caleb because he paid me\r\na visit tonight.  ",
        "Jack: He what? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, while you were protecting your poor, helpless\r\nTess, Caleb came after me. ",
        "Jack: What did he do? ",
        "Livvie: Well, , at first, I thought he was going to kill me. ",
        "Jack: But obviously he didn't. ",
        "Livvie: No, Jack, he hasn't had enough fun torturing me yet. ",
        "Jack: What did he say? ",
        "Livvie: He acts like he isn't Caleb, like he's really just\r\nthis Stephen Clay guy, but I know him, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, you do know him, don't you? ",
        "Livvie: I think he wants to drive me crazy, just torturing me,\r\npretending that he's someone else, but -- I mean, he -- he\r\ncreated an exact replica to take over my life.  ",
        "Jack: No. No, he did not create her! ",
        "Livvie: Open your eyes, Jack. Tess showed up in town the same\r\ntime Caleb did. Caleb owns her. He owns her. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Yes, Colleen. No. Thank you. Thanks for watching the boy\r\nfor the night. I really appreciate it. I do. You know he loves\r\nyou. All right. Hey. How you doing? ",
        "Tess: Nice place. It's good here. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know, it's -- it's -- it's comfortable. Can I get\r\nyou anything? Do you -- ",
        "Ian: That's -- that's one of Danny's toys. Do you want me to\r\nshow you how it works? Ok, hang on. Just go like this.  ",
        "[Tess laughs] ",
        "Ian: It's funny, right? Did you have toys like that when you\r\nwere a kid? Hmm? Do you remember being a kid? Where are you from?\r\n",
        "Tess: The forest. ",
        "Ian: I know -- the forest. That's where Jack found you. But\r\nwhat about before that? ",
        "Tess: The forest. ",
        "Ian: Forest. Ok. Well, how long did you live there? This is\r\nimportant. How long did you live in the forest? ",
        "Tess: Always.",
        "Ian: Always. Ok, what does that mean to you, always\"? Is\r\nthat a year, a month, a week, what? What are you? ",
        "Tess: I'm Tess.  ",
        "Ian: You're Tess. I -- right. You're Tess. Ok. I got to ask\r\nyou one more question. Then you can play with anything you want\r\nin here. Just -- do you know a man by the name of Caleb Morley?\r\nDo you -- the guy who was singing tonight, the guy who was on the\r\n-- Tess! ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Table for four, please. ",
        "Hostess: Do you have a reservation? ",
        "Rafe: No, I don't. ",
        "Hostess: I'm sorry. We're booked up for the whole -- it's you.\r\n",
        "Stephen: Yeah, last time I checked. ",
        "Hostess: We're really crowded, but we do have a private dining\r\nroom in the back if you like, Mr. Clay.  ",
        "Stephen: That'd be very kind of you. Thank you. ",
        "Man: Mr. Clay, can I have your autograph? You were incredible\r\nonstage tonight. It was so great finally seeing you. ",
        "Stephen: What's your name, man? ",
        "Man: Dave. ",
        "Stephen: It's nice meeting you, Dave. ",
        "Dave: Thanks. ",
        "Alison: Wait, wait. I don't know if this is such a good idea,\r\nthis dinner. ",
        "Rafe: You know what they say -- you keep your enemies close --\r\n",
        "Alison: I know, but this is a little too close, if you ask me.\r\n",
        "Rafe: I wouldn't have brought you here if I thought you were\r\nin any danger. You know that, right?  ",
        "Alison: Ye, , I know, but, Rafe, this is Caleb. ",
        "Rafe: Right now, he's presenting himself as a rock star. So\r\nwhatever game he's playing, killing people isn't part of it yet. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm so sorry, Stephen. You are quite a sport for\r\nputting up with this. ",
        "Stephen: Some things are worth it. ",
        "Stephen: What's the matter, you get lost? ",
        "Rafe: No, I just asked the hostess to bring over their best\r\nbottle of champagne. ",
        "Stephen: Nice. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. Stephen, they actually serve water here if\r\nyou prefer the restaurant's. ",
        "Stephen: Actually, alison, this is a special blend. It's\r\nloaded with electrolytes. It's good for keeping the vocal cords\r\nhydrated. Would you like to try some?  ",
        "Alison: No. I'm fine, thank you. ",
        "Waitress: Would you like to hear our specials this evening? ",
        "Stephen: Oh, please. ",
        "Waitress: We have a pan-roasted Atlantic salmon with a light\r\npeppercorn crust, and our osso bucco is slow-roasted with a rich\r\ndemi-glace, served over mushroom risotto. ",
        "Rafe: How about you, Stephen? What looks good to you? ",
        "Stephen: I'll have a steak, rare. Blood rare. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Would you just think about it, j",
        "Jack? Why do you think everyone is so caught up in how special\r\nand pure and wonderful tess is? ",
        "Jack: Because she is all those things.  ",
        "Livvie: No, it's because that's what Caleb wants. That's what\r\nhe's good at, remember? He pulls people in one by one and then\r\npicks us off whenever he feels like it. And then he created that\r\n-- that thing to take over my life and reel everyone else in. ",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. \"That thing\"? Is that what\r\nyou call Tess? Livvie, look at you. You're barely human anymore.\r\nLook at what you've become. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, and when did that happen, Jack? When? When Caleb\r\nturned my life inside out. I'm well aware of who I am and the\r\nthings I've done, but this -- this is not just me. I didn't do\r\nthis alone. And god knows I am paying the price for my sins. I\r\nhave -- my baby -- Jack, my -- my baby -- I don't have anyone. I\r\nhave nobody in my life, no place to go. And you, of all people, I\r\nthought was the one person that still cared about me, but you\r\nhave made that very clear that you don't give a damn about me\r\nanymore. So where do I go from here? Where can I go to hide from\r\nhim, Jack? I can't do this alone. I can't be alone right now. So,\r\nplease, I am begging you. I need to stay with you, Jack. I know\r\nyou don't want to, and I know I shouldn't even be asking, but I'm\r\nreally, really scared right now.  ",
        "Jack: Ok. Ok, you can stay here. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, thank you, Jack. ",
        "Jack: You can have the bed, and I'll sleep on the couch. ",
        "Livvie: Thank you. Thank you, thank you. ",

        "Tess: Ian. Family. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, that's ian and his family. That's my boy danny\r\nright here and -- and that's my wife, eve. She's dead. She died.\r\nIt's one of the only pictures I have of the three of us. ",
        "Tess: She loves you. ",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Tess: I see in her eyes. Love there. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I -- you know, you should get some rest. That's\r\nyour room right touough there, ok?  ",
        "Tess: It hurts. ",
        "Ian: No, it's -- it's all better, it's all fixed now. ",
        "Tess: No, no. No, not the cut. Your heart still hurts because\r\nshe -- she died. I can't fix that. I can't fix that. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Blood rare, huh? ",
        "Stephen: Actually, I'm a vegetarian. I don't believe in\r\nkilling things. ",
        "Waitress: Well, we have a wonderful grilled vegetable dish if\r\nyou like. ",
        "Stephen: After you, Elizabeth. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I'd love that. Thank you. ",
        "Stephen: Make it two. ",
        "Alison: Um -- I'll have the salmon.  ",
        "Rafe: I'll have a steak, medium. ",
        "Waitress: Great. And when you're finished, we have a back exit\r\nif you don't want to be bothered by any more fans. ",
        "Stephen: Thank you. ",
        "Alison: So, does that get annoying, with all of the people and\r\nthe extra attention and things? ",
        "Stephen: Well, actually, Alison, that's one of the reasons why\r\nI kept my identity a secret at first. I'm actually a very private\r\nperson. ",
        "Rafe: But you've changed? ",
        "Stephen: My fans have been good to me. I thought maybe they\r\ndeserve a concert. ",
        "Rafe: Right. But no real gift is for free, right?  ",
        "Stephen: So you know the music. And here I thought this whole\r\ntime you only liked this vampire band. ",
        "Rafe: Again, my mistake. ",
        "Stephen: Actually, that little drama you caused created quite\r\na buzz. Maybe I should be thanking you. ",
        "Rafe: Don't mention it. ",
        "Stephen: But to answer your question, Alison, it actually felt\r\ngood to connect with the fans, to share the music and -- it made\r\nme feel appreciated. ",
        "Rafe: So that -- that's important to you? ",
        "Stephen: I'm human, aren't I? Actually, this -- this vampire\r\nbusiness of yours seems to have gotten around, Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: How's that? ",
        "Stephen: Well, after the concert, I passed by this girl stuck\r\non the side of the road. Her car had broken down. And when I got\r\nout -- well, she must've been a friend of yours because she\r\nstarted in this whole big vampire business, although there was\r\nthis added love story or something.  ",
        "Elizabeth: A love story? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah. Yeah, apparently this girl and this guy Caleb\r\nwere married and all this stuff happened to them, but it ended up\r\nwith her driving a stake right into his heart. Does any of this\r\nsound familiar to anyone? ",
        "Alison: Yes, it's Livvie. ",
        "Elizabeth: You saw this? ",
        "Alison: No, we didn't see it, but some other people did in the\r\ntown. ",
        "Stephen: Well, I guess that's how legends get started. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, you know, we're just a camp full of gypsies\r\nhanging on to our old world superstitions. But while we're on the\r\nsubject of legends, tell us, how did the stephen clay experience\r\ncome into being? ",
        "Stephen: You mean, where was I born, all that blah, blah,\r\nblah? Well, rafe, actually I was raised by a pack of wolves and\r\n--  ",
        "Rafe: You're a funny guy, so, come on, keep humoring me. ",
        "Stephen: It's the same old story, man. Small town, single\r\nchild, devoting parents. ",
        "Rafe: What's the name of the town? ",
        "Stephen: Ah, we don't want to turn it into a Graceland, do we?\r\n",
        "Rafe: Right, right. Did you go away to school? ",
        "Stephen: School really wasn't my gig. ",
        "Rafe: Right, music was, right? ",
        "Stephen: My passion -- amongst other things. ",
        "Rafe: How'd you get your start? ",
        "Elizabeth: What is this, 20 questions? ",
        "Stephen: No, no, sweetheart, it's ok. Rafe is still trying to\r\nfigure out if I'm his vampire guy.  ",
        "Rafe it's an extraordinary resemblance, including the\r\nsarcastic sense of humor. ",
        "Stephen: Better to be sarcastic than have none at all. ",
        "Rafe: So -- why did you pick Port Charles? I mean, it's not\r\nexactly the rock 'n' roll capital of the world. ",
        "Stephen: Joshua thought it'd be good to start small and create\r\na buzz, which, thanks to you, we did. Why'd you come here? ",
        "Rafe: My job, originally. ",
        "Stephen: And your job is? ",
        "Rafe: Vampire slayer. ",
        "[Stephen laughs] ",
        "Stephen: Oy, I take it back. You do have a sense of humor.\r\nThat or a serious drug problem. I'm not sure which. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, pretty funny, huh? ",
        "Elizabeth: I got to go. All this prattle is giving me a\r\nheadache.  ",
        "Stephen: I guess that's the lady's way of saying she finds our\r\nconversation tiresome. And no offense, Alison, so do I. Hey, you\r\nknow what? Next time you want to conduct an interview, call my\r\npublicist. I'll even throw in a couple autographed pictures. ",
        "Alison: That went really well. ",

        "Tess: More love is still there. ",
        "Ian: No, I don't think there is. ",

        "Alison: I've completely lost my appetite. Did you see the way\r\nthat she was looking at him? ",
        "Rafe: Look, here's the thing. You got to look at this from\r\nyour mother's point of view. She's never seen Caleb before. And\r\nthe idea of vampires to most people is laughable. ",
        "Alison: Is that why you said the whole line about being a\r\nvampire slayer -- to make them laugh? ",
        "Rafe: No. This whole act he's got going on is designed to make\r\nanyone suspicious of him look like a fool. ",
        "Alison: Well, honey, it's really working.  ",
        "Rafe: I know. So hopefully he'll let his guard down. ",

        "Elizabeth: What? What is it? ",
        "Stephen: Just that -- I must've left my wallet at the\r\nrestaurant. ",
        "Elizabeth: Let me call over there, and I can have them look\r\naround, and someone can bring it back by. ",
        "Stephen: No, no, I'm -- I'm sure whoever found it will do the\r\nright thing. Huh. ",
        "Elizabeth: So, why me? ",
        "Stephen: Excuse me? ",
