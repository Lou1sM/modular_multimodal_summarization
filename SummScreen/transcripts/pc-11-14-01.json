", "Livvie: Well, I'm not. ", "Jack: Like before when you heard caleb's music, when you saw caleb's ring. I mean, are you sure you're not missing blocks of time doing things you can't remember?

Here's what you lost when you pushed me away. And maybe you were right because now I know for sure we're better off apart. So why don't you just leave, ok?

", "Rafe: No. Not quite yet. You can spare some time to talk to me. You remember what I am, don't you? ", "Livvie: A motor-mouth angel who tried to convince me that caleb was using me? How can I possibly forget you? ", "Rafe: Was using you, still is. ", "Livvie: Wrong again. ", "Rafe: I saw you poison jack's drink. You wouldn't have done that on your own.", "Livvie: No, you think you got me all figured out. ", "Rafe: I know what's in your heart. ", "Livvie: You haven't a clue. I'm not under a spell. Not this time. ", "Rafe: Caleb made you believe that. ", "Livvie: Uh-uh. Free will, angel. It was my choice to go to him, just like poisoning jack was my choice. ", "Rafe: Really? Why? ", "Livvie: You really want to know? All I care about is caleb, only caleb. Killing jack would've been giving a gift to my husband, and I will do anything to prove that i'm worthy of his love. ", "Rafe: No. You'll stop yourself in the end because I know you have a good, strong heart. Maybe a little locked away right now but -- ", "livvie: Believe what you what to believe. If you really knew me, you'd know how much evil there was in me, starting with my aunt. My father's brother, ryan, my mother, my grandmother -- the whole family tree is full of lunatics happy to kill! ", "Rafe: You're not them! ", "Livvie: It's genetic. That's how i was born.

And now I'm responsible for hope. ", "Alison: No, you're not. She already has two people who've adopted her already. ", "Jamal: Yeah, because I wasn't there for her.

The two people i trusted most in the whole world hold back something this big?

", "Jack: Yes. ", "Jamal: Did it ever occur to either one of you just to be straight with me?", "Alison: We just didn't want to see you get hurt. ", "Jamal: All right, so you sneak around, get a D.N.A. Test, and then you decide to throw away the results because you, what -- you get a conscience? I don't know how to get past this. Ok? I don't know if I ever will. ", "Alison: What does that mean? ", "Jamal: Look, all I know is that the two most important people in my life betrayed me, and I don't know if that feeling's going to go away. Ever.
