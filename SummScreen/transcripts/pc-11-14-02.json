        "Lucy:\r\n        Hey, I brought you breakfast. I think you should -- well,\r\n        you're up, I guess, but maybe you look a little tired. I\r\n        also brought you some homemade soup to make you feel\r\n        better. It's not really homemade because I don't cook or\r\n        anything, so luck for you I didn't make it -- ",
        "Ian:\r\n        Slow down. Are you always this cheerful in the mornings? ",
        "Lucy: I\r\n        called you last night. Didn't you get your messages? ",
        "Ian: I\r\n        didn't -- I didn't check mine. It was -- it was a very\r\n        strange night.  ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Yeah, I know. The return of Caleb. ",
        "Ian: Or\r\n        whatever name he goes by now. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Right. Ok. You know, about that phone call -- when you\r\n        check your messages and you hear my voice, don't listen.\r\n        Just kind of fast-forward through it or maybe you should\r\n        erase it because I probably sounded really frantic and a\r\n        little nutty, and it's best if you don't because I can't\r\n        expect you to, you know, come saving me from my demons\r\n        every time I ask you that -- don't save me. ",
        "Ian: If\r\n        you were scared, why didn't you just come over? ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Right. Right. Hello. ",
        "Tess:\r\n        Hi, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Um\r\n        -- did she spend all night here dressed like that?  ",
        "Ian:\r\n        It's a very long, complicated story. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Goody. Well, you know, lucky for us, I happend to have\r\n        all the time in the world. ",
        "",
        "Jack's\r\n        voice: I will not let myself be like you. I will not be\r\n        one of the walking dead. ",
        "Caleb's\r\n        voice: Then you'll just be dead. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Are you ok? ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Ohh. Yeah. Yeah. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        I don't believe you. I heard you pacing all night long. ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Yeah, well, sorry if I disturbed you. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        You didn't disturb me. I was worried about you. ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Well, it's not every day the vampire who tries to kill\r\n        you flies back into town.  ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Hey, Jack, I'm really scared, too, so at least we're in\r\n        this together, right? ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Right. Just like the good old days, right? ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Are you trying to be sarcastic? ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Just save it, Livvie, ok? ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Save what, Jack? I'm trying to be nice to you. ",
        "Jack:\r\n        You know what? It's ok. You don't have to be nice. You\r\n        don't have to do anything. And, come on, would you please\r\n        put some clothes on? ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Is that it? You think I'm using Caleb coming into town to\r\n        do what, trap you into having sex with me? ",
        "Jack: I\r\n        don't know. You tell me, Livvie. It's not like you\r\n        haven't worked that angle before.  ",
        "",
        "Alison:\r\n        So, did you find anything? ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        No, not yet. Who was that on the phone earlier? ",
        "Alison:\r\n        It was my mother. She called to say that she spent the\r\n        night with Stephen Clay and she lived to tell about it.\r\n        No bite marks, no scratches, no nothing, and, Rafe, we\r\n        still don't have any proof. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Yet. Don't have any proof yet. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        Yeah, but what if there isn't any? I mean, so far\r\n        everything that we're getting here is pointing to him\r\n        being a rock star, not him the vampire, as Caleb. ",
        "Fe:\r\n        Alison, I can't find any pictures of Stephen Clay, the\r\n        rock star, anywhere. I'll tell you what I think happened.\r\n        Caleb found some guy, some poor guy with no family, stole\r\n        his identity, and covered his tracks.  ",
        "Alison:\r\n        I know. So how do we -- how do we prove it's Caleb if he\r\n        hasn't killed anyone? ",
        "Rafe: So\r\n        you're telling me you don't think that Stephen is Caleb? ",
        "Alison:\r\n        I don't know. I don't know. But this is starting to\r\n        really scare me. ",
        "Rafe: I\r\n        know. But it's going to be ok, all right? I'm ready for\r\n        him this time. I am. I'm smarter. I'm more prepared -- ",
        "Alison:\r\n        Rafe, Caleb killed you once before. Don't you get that? I\r\n        mean, if you -- if you try and fight this battle with him\r\n        again, honey, you've already lost it once. I don't want\r\n        to lose you again. I can't. I can't do that again.  ",

        "",
        "Lucy: So\r\n        Livvie shows up at Jack's place, ready to drive a stake\r\n        through Tess' heart, and you ride to the rescue. ",
        "Ian:\r\n        Well, something like that, yeah. ",
        "Tess: Hi.\r\n        ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Hi, you, again. Ok. She sure enjoys her food, doesn't\r\n        she? ",
        "Ian:\r\n        Yeah. No, she does. And it's a good sign. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Really? Good sign of what? ",
        "Ian:\r\n        She's feeling better, you know, and she's not scared\r\n        anymore. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Right. Right. I guess I would've been really scared if\r\n        Livvie had shown up like that -- not to mention the fact\r\n        they might be identical twins. Did you finally get the\r\n        results of the D.N.A. Test?  ",
        "Ian: Uh\r\n        -- they were faulty we got to take more tests. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        You know, you are really not a very good liar. And\r\n        normally I would find that very attractive in a person,\r\n        but not this time. ",
        "Ian:\r\n        Just drop it, would you? Come on. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        \"Drop it\"? You know what? You're not only a bad\r\n        liar, you're also just dumb. You know me. I will torture\r\n        and torment you until you tell me the truth. What is\r\n        going on? ",
        "Ian: Ok.\r\n        According to the test results, Tess and Livvie are not\r\n        related, all right? ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Good. That's -- I mean, I'm glad to have that fact. What\r\n        -- what else is there? There's something else going on.  ",
        "Ian: And\r\n        according to the same test, Tess doesn't have any D.N.A. ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        What? What does -- what? What does that mean? ",
        "Ian:\r\n        What it -- it's -- it doesn't matter, you know? ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        What? What? What? What are you talking about, it doesn't\r\n        matter? A vampire shows up back in town and this look-alike\r\n        bride of his shows up, too, around the same time, and now\r\n        you're telling me she's not even a human being? How can\r\n        that not matter? ",
        "Ian: It\r\n        doesn't. ",
        "Lucy: I\r\n        don't believe that's coming out of your mouth. ",
        "Ian: It\r\n        doesn't matter because whoever or whatever she is, maybe\r\n        she came here to balance the scales against the Calebs of\r\n        this world.  ",
        "Lucy:\r\n        Oh, boy, it does matter. ",
        "",
        "Livvie:\r\n        What is wrong with you? Has Tess blown your ego so much\r\n        you have lost all sense of reason? ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Leave her out of this. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        You were so freaked last night about Caleb, and I\r\n        comforted you, as any other friend would. ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Livvie, you're not just like any friend. You always have\r\n        some kind of agenda. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Ok. Jack, I admit it. I loved you. I love you. I won't\r\n        lie. It wouldn't break my heart if you wanted me again.\r\n        But you have hinted to me a thousand times over again\r\n        that you are done with me. So I get it, Jack. Ok, I still\r\n        do have some pride left, you know.  ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Yeah. Just so we're clear on that. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        And if it makes you feel any better, I am using you to\r\n        help me with Caleb. I mean, is that a good enough agenda\r\n        for you? ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Completely makes sense. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        It's all about survival,Jack -- yours and mine. And\r\n        whether we like it or not, he almost turned both of us\r\n        into vampires. ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Yeah, but the difference was I didn't want it. I'm not so\r\n        sure about you. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        I killed him, didn't I? ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Yeah, after you basically caused everybody hell. But,\r\n        hey, who knows, Livvie, maybe Caleb will forgive you. ",
        "Livvie:\r\n        Jack, forgive me? He wants to kill me after he's done\r\n        torturing me. And I thought maybe if I had you in my\r\n        corner, I'd have a better chance of survival.  ",
        "Jack:\r\n        Well, I don't know what's more dangerous -- having Caleb\r\n        back in my life or having you.",

        " ",
        "Rafe: I\r\n        don't want this to be happening, either. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        I know, but it is, again. And it never really seems to go\r\n        away. Rafe, when you were sent back to me, I thought that\r\n        we were going to get to be, like, a normal couple. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        And everything's going to be ok. We're going to be ok, I\r\n        promise you. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        Rafe, just as -- just as you say that, I feel our little\r\n        dream slipping away -- our little house on the hill with\r\n        the fence and the cute mailbox and everything else. You\r\n        know? I know you. I do. I know you better than anyone.\r\n        And I can feel the excitement of the hunt running through\r\n        your veins.  ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        But, no, that's not everything I am anymore. That's not\r\n        everything that I feel. You -- you've changed me forever.\r\n        I have you to live for now. And I'm not going to let\r\n        anybody or anything take that away from me. You know what\r\n        I forgot? ",
        "Alison:\r\n        What? ",
        "Rafe: To\r\n        tell you how much I love you. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        No, you didn't. You tell me that every day. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Close your eyes. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        What? ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Just keep them closed. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Put out your hand. ",
        "Rafe: I\r\n        think this should make it truly official now. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Will you, Alison Barrington, do me the incredible honor\r\n        of being my wife?  ",
        "Alison:\r\n        It's beautiful. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Now it's beautiful. ",

        "Alison:\r\n        Wait, wait, wait. I need to see my ring. Just a second.\r\n        Oh, my gosh. This is so beautiful. This looks like it was\r\n        made for me. Watch how it sparkles in the light. How did\r\n        you pay for this I mean, you would've had to sell your\r\n        soul -- Rafe Kovich, did you? ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        No, it didn't cost me my soul. Just an arm and a leg. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        Well, I know that vampire slayers don't exactly make the\r\n        big bucks.  ",
        "Rafe: I\r\n        used a small part of an inheritance my mother left me. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        Oh, your mother. I wish I could've met her. I wonder if\r\n        she would've liked me. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        She would've loved you, almost as much as I do. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        I love it. I absolutely love it. You know, you could've\r\n        given me anything out of -- you know, from anywhere -- a\r\n        gumball machine, a Cracker Jack box, a piece of string --\r\n        and I would've loved it. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Oh, wow. ",
        "Alison:\r\n        You didn't have to go this big. ",
        "Rafe:\r\n        Well, now you tell me. Can you give me that back? ",
