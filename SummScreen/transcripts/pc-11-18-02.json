        "Alison: Rafe and I are going to \r\nhave such a happy, normal life together. Oh, and nobody will be able to take \r\nthat away from us. \r\nNot even Caleb. ",

        "Alison: Wow. That must be my \r\nhusband-to-be, who forgot his key -- again. Hi! ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison -- \n",
        "Alison: Oh no, no. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I know that \r\nyou're upset about last night, but listen, I have to talk to you. It's \r\nimportant. ",
        "Alison: Go away, mother. \n",
        "Elizabeth: No, not until you \r\nhear what I have to say. Stop being so stubborn. Come on, I'll go away \r\nafterwards if you don't -- just listen to me, Alison. Guess what. I think I may \r\nhave found your sister.\r\n\n",

        "Marissa: Jamal, let me go!\r\n",
        "Jamal: Would you just -- I had \r\nto get you out of there, ok? Now let's get you someplace safe and let's go, come \r\non. ",
        "Marissa: No! You're acting like \r\na lunatic. I'm not going to go anywhere with you. ",
        "Jamal: Look, would you just \r\ntrust me on this? Ok, you have no idea of the danger you're in, Marissa. \n",
        "Marissa: Oh, really? If you \r\nthink for one second that I'm going to believe that Stephen Clay is this vampire \r\nyou're talking about -- ",
        "Jamal: Marissa, you know that \r\nit's not that crazy. Think of the whole reason why you came to Port Charles in \r\nthe first place -- because you heard about all the crazy stuff that was \r\nhappening here, ok? Now come on, you even asked me when we first met about \r\nvampires. You remember that?\r\n\n",
        "Marissa: Yeah, I remember that, \r\nand you said that I was nuts. Do you remember that? ",
        "Jamal: I lied. I lied. \n",
        "Marissa: You lied? ",
        "Jamal: Marissa, come on. I \r\nlied, ok? Your friend -- this big rock star -- he is the big bat we were talking \r\nabout. ",
        "Marissa: The big bat. Ok, \r\nright, Jamal. That explains why he loves soaking up the sun, why he puts garlic \r\non everything he eats, why I've never seen one single fang on him ever. Jamal, \r\nthis is ridiculous. ",
        "Jamal: This is not a joke. I am \r\nserious. ",
        "Marissa: No, I'm serious, too, \r\nok? I know the guy. ",

        "Tess: Because I love him.\r\n",

        "Livvie: Because you are not so \r\npure and perfect, Tess. ",
        "Tess: What do you mean? \n",
        "Livvie: Let's see. How do I put \r\nthis? Ahem. It's a word I have a feeling Jack hasn't taught you yet, and I'll \r\nkeep it to one simple word, and that word is \"jealous.\" Sweet, perfect Tess is \r\njealous. ",

        "Elizabeth: Canada. ",
        "Alison: Canada? ",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, your father \r\nyears ago used to do a lot of business there, and apparently he was doing more \r\nthan business there. There was a woman who he was seeing, and as it turns out, \r\nshe had a child, a daughter. ",
        "Alison: And you think that that \r\ndaughter might be -- ",
        "Elizabeth: The math works out. \r\nIt very well could be that Malcolm is the father.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: It could be, but it's \r\nnot positive that it is. ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, I don't want \r\nto get your hopes up, but I have a really good feeling about this woman. \n",
        "Alison: And you talked to her?\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: On the phone. And \r\nshe's very sincere. Alison, this could be the answer that you've been looking \r\nfor. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, or maybe you just \r\nwant it to be so bad so you can get your hands on the money. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm not going to lie \r\nto you, the money is important, but, Alison, I know how much this means to you, \r\nand for that reason alone, I don't want to be mistaken. What, you don't believe \r\nme? ",
        "Alison: Well, mother, you've \r\ngiven me plenty of reasons in the past not to.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: I don't blame you at \r\nall. You have absolutely no reason to trust me. ",
        "Alison: Well, anyway -- ok.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: Anyway, I just \r\nwanted to tell you that I found that out. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Elizabeth: All right. Alison, I \r\nneed to apologize. I need to apologize for losing my temper last night. It was \r\njust so important. I just want you to give Stephen a chance, that's all. He's \r\nsuch an amazing man. ",
        "Alison: Mother, you don't even \r\nknow him. You just met him. ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, you don't know \r\nhim, either. ",
        "Alison: Please, please, can we \r\nnot go there? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, he makes me \r\nhappy. Can you understand that? He makes me feel more special and more wanted \r\nthan I ever have in my entire life. There is no way that that man can be the \r\nmonster that you and Rafe keep talking about.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: That man -- please, I \r\nbeg you, just move on to another subject. ",

        "Elizabeth: I know, but this is \r\nthe first time that I've seen it on your hand! ",
        "Alison: Well, that's because he \r\njust -- he just gave it to me today. ",
        "Elizabeth: You know, I saw that \r\nring before I even knew who he was, or before I even knew it belonged to you.\r\n",
        "Alison: That day in the \r\nRecovery Room? ",
        "Elizabeth: Mm-hmm. Oh, he was \r\nso excited to give that to you. He was so nervous that you weren't going to like \r\nit, and I told him -- I said, \"That is beautiful, and that lucky girl is going \r\nto love it.\"\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do love it. \r\nAnd, mother, I love Rafe. ",

        "Rafe: Here, look at this. Whoa, \r\nwhoa, whoa, whoa. It's a phone. Ok? It's a phone. Look at that. What do you see?\r\n",

        "Rafe: So that guy that you \r\nalmost offed might actually be Stephen Clay, or so it seems. ",
        "Jack: Oh, so you're saying you \r\nbelieve this because of some stupid picture? ",
        "Rafe: No, no, what I'm telling \r\nyou is -- ",
        "jack: No, no, Rafe. It's Caleb. \r\nHe can do anything, and changing his identity is nothing. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I know that. \r\nThere's nothing that guy can do to prove to me that he's not Caleb. ",
        "Jack: Then why? ",
        "Rafe: Well, because we don't \r\nhave any proof that he is Caleb. So you kill him and you are going to jail for \r\nthe murder of Stephen Clay. ",
        "That is the way it would have \r\ngone down. I know that. Now listen to me. We're going to get him. Caleb is going \r\ndown, but we have to be smart about this. Do you understand?\r\n\n",

        "Jamal: I thought you were \r\nCasey, ok? Fine. But what does that have to do with this? ",
        "Marissa: It has everything to \r\ndo with this. I look exactly like Casey, but I was not her. ",

Jack doesn't -- \r\nGod, he doesn't need me because every time I come back into his life, I hurt \r\nhim, just like you said, and that's not right. See, Jack saved me once, too, and \r\nnot that long ago, and -- well, at least he tried to save me. Anyway, what I'm \r\ntrying to say is I don't blame you for loving Jack. He's a really great guy, and \r\nhe deserves to be happy. And as much as it hurts to admit this, I -- I really \r\nthink he could be happy with you. What I'm trying to say, Tess, is I am sorry I \r\nunderestimated you. I see that now. And I will never make that mistake again. I \r\npromise.\r\n\n",
