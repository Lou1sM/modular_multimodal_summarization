        "Eve: Oh. Ian, this was all a mistake. Kevin's had a little bit too much to \r\ndrink. ",
        "Ian: This was the plan all along. ",
        "Eve: What plan? ",
        "Ian: Wanting me to look like the bad guy so he can get you back. Well, that's \r\nnot going to happen, my friend. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm not quite ready to leave yet, my friend. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: So Livvie denied it? ",
        "Jack: Up and down, she didn't put poison in my drink. ",
        "Rafe: And you believe her? ",
        "Jack: Well, let's just say I'm not going to have her cook dinner anytime \r\nsoon. ",
        "Rafe: Smart move. ",
        "Jack: You know something you're not saying. ",
        "Rafe: No, I'm just -- I'm glad you're looking into it. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, well, something strange definitely is going on with Livvie. \r\nI mean, we didn't work out, but Livvie's no murderer, Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: So, what, you think someone put her up to it maybe? ",
        "Jack: Well, she's insisted that Caleb's been haunting her, but, I mean, come \r\non, Caleb can't make Livvie do bad things from the grave. Or can he? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Caleb! I knew it. I knew you were still alive. ",
        "Livvie: Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, get away from him. Get away from him. Come over here. Are you \r\nok? Are you all right? Did he hurt you? Are you ok? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, what's going on? ",
        "Lucy: Where is he? Caleb! You blood-sucking coward, you come back here! I \r\nknow you're still here! ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, did you just say Caleb? ",
        "Lucy: Yes! Yes, the dark, deadly person standing right next to you? Yes! ",
        "Livvie: Um, I don't know what you're talking about, Lucy. I've been alone all \r\nnight. Caleb isn't here. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Oh, this is beautiful. That look on your face implies a bit of a \r\ndouble standard, though, doesn't it? ",
        "Ian: What are you babbling about now? ",
        "Kevin: I think you know. ",
        "Ian: You're here kissing my wife. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, and you're such a saint, you'd never touch a woman that wasn't \r\nyours, would you? ",
        "Ian: You're drunk. ",
        "Kevin: But you weren't. You just did whatever you wanted. ",
        "Ian: If you have something to say, just say it, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Don't tempt me. ",
        "Eve: Kevin, tell me. ",
        "Kevin: Forget it. Forget it. What's done is done. Eve, I am sorry about that. \r\nThat wasn't me. I don't know what that was. ",
        "Eve: Oh, no, no, no, it's ok. You were drunk. You had -- ",
        "Kevin: I wish I could blame the alcohol. It was wrong no matter how you look \r\nat it. ",
        "Eve: No harm done. ",
        "Kevin: You know I'd never do anything to hurt you. ",
        "Ian: Well, let's just call it a night then, shall we? ",
        "Eve: Do you want me to take you home? You've had a little bit too much to \r\ndrink. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, thank you. I'll call a cab. ",
        "Eve: Thank you for not overreacting. ",
        "Ian: Well, he was drunk. But he was right. I, uh -- I made some big mistakes \r\nand I think you should know about it and -- I'm truly sorry. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Ok, Rafe, so have I lost it or do you think it's possible that Caleb \r\ncan control Livvie from the grave? I mean, you're the vampire slayer. I think \r\nyou should kind of know these things, right? ",
        "Rafe: Well, you've been pretty up close and personal with Caleb yourself. \r\nWhat do you think? ",
        "Jack: Well, he definitely has some crazy powers. And maybe that includes \r\nreaching out beyond death. ",
        "Rafe: You could be on to something. ",
        "Jack: Ok, that's the second time you act like you know something's going on. \r\nAre you holding back on me, or what, Rafe? ",
        "Rafe: No, no, I'm just interested in your theories. Now, do you see any kind \r\nof pattern with Livvie? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. After Caleb died, she insisted on that Caleb was haunting her.\r\n",
        "Rafe: How? ",
        "Jack: His ring. His ring would, like, appear in front of her at odd times, in \r\nodd places. And his music -- she kept hearing Caleb's music, that music that \r\ncame from that music box Caleb had. ",
        "Rafe: Did Livvie ever see this box? ",
        "Jack: She found it in the catacombs after he died. ",
        "Rafe: Let me get this straight -- Livvie went to the catacombs alone, even \r\nthough she was so scared? Does that make sense? ",
        "Jack: Well, she said she was kind of drawn there. I mean, I found her there \r\none time half-dressed, not knowing how she got there. I mean, it's all pretty \r\ncrazy. ",
        "Rafe: Right, so these catacombs are an important part of the puzzle. Like you \r\nsaid. ",
        "Jack: Right. Right, so maybe -- maybe we should go there, check them out. \r\nMaybe we'll find some clues about Livvie's problems. ",
        "Rafe: You guys aren't making this easy, are you? If I could just tell Jack \r\nstraight up that Caleb's back, then -- all right, I know, I know. Rules are \r\nrules. I get it. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: How could you not see him? Caleb was standing right beside you! ",
        "Livvie: Ok, Lucy, I'm really worried about you. ",
        "Lucy: Well, don't! I'm fine because, Livvie, I saw him. He was standing right \r\nhere. I saw him, and now all the pieces are starting to fit together. This is \r\nwho's been causing all the trouble everybody's been having. It's Caleb! ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, if Caleb were here, wouldn't I know it? Wouldn't I have seen \r\nhim, too? He would've tried to hurt me or take me away or something, right? \r\nListen, first you think you see Christina and then you think you see Caleb. I \r\nmean, what's going on with you, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: I'll tell you. I'll tell you what's going on. It's Caleb. He's playing \r\nthese twisted mind games with me. Actually, he's been doing that with everybody. \r\nHe's using our fears and our doubts to get at us. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, why don't -- why don't you just let me take you home so you can \r\ntalk to Dad and he'll help you. ",
        "Lucy: No! Livvie, stop, I don't need a shrink. But we will call your dad. You \r\nknow, he was, the last time I talked to him, involved in some major crisis, but \r\nthis is a huge 911! ",
        "Livvie: Ok, what are you going to tell him, that you're seeing scary monsters \r\nin the woods, Lucy? It's probably just some tree branch or something. ",
        "Lucy: No, I am going to tell him I'm right! That my hunch is right! ",
        "Livvie: Caleb's dead, Lucy. You've been telling me that for weeks. ",
        "Lucy: I know. Caleb wanted us to think he was dead. That's what makes him so \r\ndangerous. Oh, Livvie, come on, there's no time to lose. Come on. ",
        "",
        "Eve: You look so serious. ",
        "Ian: I'm, uh -- I don't want there to be any secrets between us. You know how \r\nmuch I love you. ",
        "Eve: Yes. ",
        "Ian: There's something we've got to discuss. ",
        "Eve: Right. I know. I need to clear the air, too, so why don't you let me go \r\nfirst?",
        "Ian: No, you don't understand, I -- ",
        "Eve: If you don't -- you know, you don't have to worry about Kevin. What you \r\njust walked in on right now was nothing. It meant nothing. He was drunk and he \r\nwas upset. ",
        "Ian: I'm not talking about Kevin. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: I'm -- ",
        "Eve: You're talking about me. Look, I think you're probably wondering if \r\nduring all of our troubles I somehow got closer to my ex. ",
        "Ian: I -- sometimes -- sometimes, even when you're deeply in love with \r\nsomeone and you hurt, you may turn to someone else. You -- ",
        "Eve: Ian, Ian, no matter how angry I get at you, I would never, ever run to \r\nanother man. I mean, when we took our marriage vows, we promised to be faithful \r\nand to love each other and to work out our problems together. ",
        "Ian: And I wanted that, but I need -- I needed someone to hear me. ",
        "Eve: I know. ",
        "Ian: And -- ",
        "Eve: I know that I hurt you when I turned away from you, but I would never, \r\never, ever hurt you by turning to Kevin. ",
        "Ian: Eve, if you were in pain because of -- ",
        "Eve: We would never betray each other, especially when we're trying to work \r\nthings out. Besides, it would only hurt Danny. ",
        "Ian: Danny, Danny. Danny needs us both. ",
        "Eve: Yes, he does. What'd you want tell me? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Doc? Doc! Ok, he's not home, but we are going to sit here, right on the \r\ncouch you are, until your dad gets home. ",
        "Livvie: You're overreacting, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I am not overreacting. Overreacting would be building this big, great \r\nwall of garlic all around the door and putting crosses all over the place. \r\nThat's overreacting. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but I'd know if Caleb were back. ",
        "Lucy: Maybe. Maybe not. But, Livvie, this time I feel that it's different. \r\nHe's acting different. He's doing different things, like trying to get inside \r\npeople's head, trying to get inside my head. That would so explain why I'm \r\nhaving these visions. ",
        "Livvie: So now you think Christina's just a vision when you were just saying \r\nshe was real. ",
        "Lucy: She was to me for a while. I mean, I was the only one who could see her \r\nand she kept reappearing and disappearing, almost like someone was trying to \r\ndrive me out of my mind, which almost worked. But I have this picture. ",
        "Livvie: Ahem. A picture of nothing. ",
        "Lucy: Exactly. Don't you see? If she was real -- because I know I took that \r\npicture of her sitting on my couch -- she would be there, but she's not. ",
        "Livvie: I know, I was there. I saw it. I mean, I didn't see anything. ",
        "Lucy: Right. But there is something in the picture. Look, there's just like a \r\nlittle shadow, maybe a blurry little object. Something is in that picture, and \r\nfrom everything I've read about vampires, don't you see, vampires cannot be \r\nphotographed. That's why I got that shivery feeling, followed you into the woods \r\non this hunch to warn you! ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, next you're going to be saying you see Elvis' face in this \r\npicture. ",
        "Lucy: What -- what is with you? I am telling you that your worst nightmare \r\ncould be coming true and you're making jokes about Elvis. ",
        "Livvie: It's just really hard to believe what you're saying, that's all. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy. What's up? Slow night? ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, I'm so glad you're here. Listen, you know when I called and \r\ncalled you about Christina? It wasn't Christina. It was Caleb. ",
        "Kevin: Run that by me again. ",
        "Lucy: I had this hunch -- I'll tell you about it later -- but I followed \r\nLivvie into the woods and, when I got there, I saw the big bat himself. ",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh. Livvie? Was Caleb with you? ",
        "Livvie: No, Dad, I didn't see anything. That's why I brought Lucy straight \r\nhere. ",
        "Lucy: Look, maybe she couldn't see him because she is not a slayer. I am. \r\nDoc, I saw him. As sure as you are standing right there, I saw him for myself. \r\nAnd that explains so much, all the bad things that have been happening! ",
        "Kevin: Don't start blaming what's going on between us on some phantom \r\nvampire. ",
        "Lucy: But I've been trying to tell you, trying and trying to tell you that it \r\nis this dark force, this evil -- ",
        "Kevin: Right, of course, blame the force, Lucy. You know, we all make \r\nchoices. ",
        "Lucy: We can't make choices if Caleb's out there pulling all of our strings.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you do whatever you want. And when it blows up in your face, you \r\nblame someone else. This is sounding so familiar. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I admit we have problems, but it's because of Caleb these bad \r\nthings are happening. I swear to you, Doc, I'm telling you the truth. ",
        "Kevin: And you always tell me the truth, right? ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Homey, isn't it? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, real homey. Been here a million times and still no clue on \r\nLivvie's behavior. ",
        "Rafe: Well, maybe you missed something. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I must have. It's not every day the woman you love tries to \r\npoison you. ",
        "Rafe: Don't worry, you'll get to the bottom of this. ",
        "Jack: You know, Rafe, I know I should just try to forget, but it's just so \r\nhard to see her in pain. ",
        "Rafe: I hear you. There was a woman who needed my help once. ",
        "Jack: What happened? ",
        "Rafe: I helped her, but it killed me. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Rafe: I mean, it killed me seeing her in so much pain and so upset, which is \r\nwhy I know you can't give up on Livvie. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, well, I don't even know what I'm looking for. This whole \r\nthing is pretty hopeless. ",
        "[Caleb's music plays] ",
        "Rafe: Wait. Hear that? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, it's the music Livvie was telling me about. ",
        "Rafe: What do you think it means? ",
        "Jack: If this is Caleb's, then what Livvie's saying is true. ",
        "Rafe: And it's possible -- ",
        "Jack: That Caleb is reaching straight out of hell for Livvie. ",

        "Eve's Voice: No, Michael. ",
        "Caleb's Voice: It's my body now, my future -- mine. ",
        "Caleb: I'm so close to regaining my power, I can taste it. I summon you, the \r\ndarkness, the strength that was mine! I need you now! Serve me! Serve me! ",
        "Caleb: At last. You've come back to me. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: What is going on here? You really believe that I would make up \r\nsomething so huge and big just as a lame excuse to cover up all our problems?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I don't know what you do anymore, Lucy. You sure don't seem to care \r\nwho you hurt. ",
        "Lucy: Wow. Where is that coming from? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you come in here and you rattle on about vampires and evil right \r\nin front of my daughter when you know that just Caleb's name is enough to scare \r\nher half to death. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, ok, I get it now. You're right, we can talk about it later. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- go home. ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry that I upset you. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I can take care of myself and Livvie. So just do what you have \r\nto do. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I guess what I have to do is get a good night's sleep before I do \r\nwhatever I have to do. ",
        "Kevin: It's a wonder you can. ",

        "Ian: I'd do anything to erase the past few months. ",
        "Eve: I know. ",
        "Ian: But I can't, so we just need to move forward, you know, one day at a \r\ntime. ",
        "Eve: For our son. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. You and Danny are all I need. You know, the first time I saw him, \r\nhe was living proof of what we felt for each other. ",
        "Eve: I remember the first time you held him. It was like he was made of glass.\r\n",
        "Ian: I remember the first time I held you. And I remember when you told me \r\nthat you loved me. But I think of those times and I see us now, and it makes me \r\nsad. ",
