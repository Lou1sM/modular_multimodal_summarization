        "Ian: Hi.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Hi. I guess we're going \r\nto be doing this. I guess we can't really just stay out of each other's lives, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Ian: I guess not, no. \n",
        "Lucy: No. Right. Um -- I'm \r\ngood, and you're good, I hope. ",
        "Ian: Oh -- ",
        "lucy: Yeah? It's weird that we \r\njust kind of ran into each other exactly at the same time. ",
        "Ian: Listen, I'm -- ",
        "lucy: No, you're here to see \r\nJack, and I'm here to see Jack. Well, obviously, you're at Jack's place, so you \r\nprobably came to see Jack. ",
        "Ian: No, I came to see Tess.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Tess is at your place, \r\nwasn't she? ",
        "Ian: Oh, yeah -- no, yeah, she \r\nwas, and then she left, and I thought she'd be here, but it doesn't look like \r\nanyone's home.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, maybe we should -- \r\nyou didn't knock loud -- they didn't hear you. I'll try. ",

        "Jack: So that's how it's going \r\nto be? We're going to be stuck here in jail while Caleb's out there doing \r\nwhatever he wants, whenever he wants. ",
        "Rafe: Well, we can't do \r\nanything anyway till we prove that Caleb's a vampire, especially because \r\neverybody thinks we're crazy. ",
        "Jack: Right. We have to prove \r\nit. I just don't like it. ",

        "Jack: Look, I'll call Chris and \r\nhave him -- ",

        "Elizabeth: Well -- guilty as \r\ncharged, but -- ",
        "Alison: How could you do \r\nsomething like this? ",
        "Elizabeth: The plane's already \r\ntaken off. Well, I just thought it was a good opportunity for us to get to know \r\neach other better. ",
        "Alison: No, I know everyone \r\nvery well, thank you, and that's why this plane is turning around right now.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, no, no, wait, \r\nwait, wait, wait. ",

        "Stephen: Oh, you'll have to \r\nspeak up. These cellular connections -- ",

        "Lucy: Oh, and I -- they're not \r\nupstairs. I checked everywhere. ",
        "Ian: Tess came here after she \r\nleft my house and probably just went to hang out with Jack and maybe they went \r\nsomewhere. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah -- right. It's late. \r\nIt's late, and they're probably going to show up any minute -- here. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Ian: Right, so we'll stay --\r\n",

        "Lucy: Together here? \n",

        "Ian: Yeah. No problem. \n",
        "Lucy: Right. Tess. When -- when \r\ndid she -- she left your place when? ",

        "Ian: I -- it could -- could be. \r\nThat's possible, you know. Maybe she just wanted to give us some privacy. And \r\nanyway, I promised Jack that I would keep an eye on her. That's why I'm here.\r\n",

        "ian: With everything? \n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, with everything. \r\nAnd I seemed ok with it then, right? Then.\r\n\n",
        "Ian: And now? ",
        "Lucy: No. I'm not -- no, \r\nbecause when one has their best friend tell them that they're in love with them, \r\nI'm not sure what one is supposed to do and, see, this one right here has \r\nabsolutely no idea how to handle any this. ",

        "Stephen: Well, then we're all \r\nfine with it. ",
        "Alison: No, \"fine\" is not a \r\nodod description of what I'm feeling right now. There's a -- there's a missed \r\ncall on my cell phone. Did you answer it, one of you? ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, I was in the \r\ncockpit with you. ",
        "Stephen: Well, I can't be too \r\nsure, but I think it was your fiance. Is there any nuts on this flight? \n",
        "Alison: You answered my phone?\r\n",
        "Stephen: I thought I was being \r\nhelpful. ",
        "Alison: Are you crazy? You \r\nthought that I was mad at you before about being stuck on this flight. Wait \r\nuntil Rafe gets ahold of you. He's going to rip you apart.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Well, that's going to \r\nbe kind of hard to do from his jail cell. ",

        "Elizabeth: A stake? And Rafe \r\nwas helping him? ",
        "Stephen: No, no. Actually, Rafe \r\nwas too busy trying to shoot me with a loaded gun. Fortunately, he missed us \r\nboth, but just barely.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: Did you hear what \r\nhe's saying, Alison? They were trying to kill him. What, are those guys insane?\r\n",
        "Alison: He wasn't trying to \r\nkill him. ",

        "Alison: No, thank you. \n",
        "Stephen: Just -- for one \r\nmoment, imagine what it might feel like just to be living your life, not wanting \r\nto bother anybody, and all of a sudden people start accusing you of being \r\nsomething that you're not. And then, to make matters worse, you couldn't prove \r\nyou weren't who they said you were.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: I'd say that sounds \r\nfamiliar. ",
        "Alison: Mother? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, you know \r\nwhat it's like to be falsely accused. Honey, you were on trial for committing a \r\nmurder that didn't even happen. ",
        "Alison: That's not the same \r\nthing. ",
        "Stephen: Hey, I resemble this \r\nCaleb guy. You know, I get that. But I don't know what I can do to prove to you \r\nthat I'm not Caleb and I'm definitely not a vampire. I mean, if you have any \r\nideas, please tell me and I will do it. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, for starters, \r\nI want you to drop the charges against Rafe and Jack. ",
        "Elizabeth: Honey, he can't do \r\nthat. If it's a criminal offense --\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Elizabeth -- please, \r\nif I may. Look, I meant it when I said I don't want any trouble, especially not \r\nwith a member of your family. I -- I care about you too much. I just want to be \r\nleft alone to make music. ",
        "Alison: So then you'll drop the \r\ncharges? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah -- if you'll give \r\nme something in return. ",
        "Alison: What is that? \n",
        "Stephen: Your word that you'll \r\ndo everything you can to keep your fiance away from me. Just -- just leave me \r\nalone. Do you understand me? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison? Yes, she \r\ndoes understand you, and she's going to do exactly that. You're going to put an \r\nend to this nonsense.\r\n\n",

        "Lucy: Well, yes -- yes, there \r\nwas. I -- but you know how things are. I am -- I'm married. And you know how I \r\nfeel about Kevin. So what did you think would happen? That I would just fly into \r\nyour arms somehow? Just --\r\n\n",
        "Ian: No. You explained all \r\nthat. It's ok. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then -- yes, I did, \r\nso what did you really -- tell me, what did you really think would happen?\r\n",
