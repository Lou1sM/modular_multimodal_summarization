        "Jamal: So, you sure he's not \r\naround? ",
        "Marissa: I called earlier. \r\nReese said it's just the band practicing. Stephen is out of town. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, good, because I \r\ndon't want him around when you drop the bad news. I don't want Caleb around you \r\never. You sure you're ok? ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. Yeah. \n",
        "Jamal: Ok. Look, I know this is \r\nhard for you to give up and everything -- ",
        "Marissa: It is, but you know \r\nwhat? It's -- you -- you are more important to me, and I trust you. So if you \r\nbelieve that Stephen is dangerous, then --\r\n\n",
        "Jamal: Look, I just don't want \r\nanything happening to you. I don't. I love you. ",
        "Marissa: Me, too. ",
        "Jamal: My baby. Ricky. Ricky, \r\nRicky. Sorry about what went down between us. ",
        "Ricky: \"Between us\"? You hit \r\nme, all right, and you know I can't hit you back because I'll go back to jail.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Look, well, you don't \r\nknow what you're getting into. That's why. ",
        "Ricky: Marissa, you know the \r\nrules -- no strangers allowed in rehearsal. So why don't you take off? \n",
        "Marissa: Actually, Ricky, I'm \r\nnot here to practice. I'm quitting the band. ",
        "",
        "Ian: So you came here to mend \r\nfences with Tess?\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: After everything you have \r\nsaid about her -- ",
        "Livvie: I told you -- it's \r\nbecause I was so cruel to her, and that's why I came here to apologize. But the \r\ntwo of you have never told me what you're doing here. I mean, it's like you're \r\njoined at the hip. ",
        "Ian: Came to see Jack. \n",
        "Lucy: I came to see Tess. Jack \r\n-- I came -- ",
        "ian: Jack. ",
        "Lucy: He came to see Tess.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Seems like you \r\ngot your lines crossed. ",
        "Ian: No, we don't. ",
        "Lucy: No -- ",
        "Lucy: We came to see both of \r\nthem. Anyway, that's not -- I got to call Jack. Couldn't get him earlier. Excuse \r\nme one second.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: I hope he didn't go \r\nafter Caleb. He's so protective. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, jack is so \r\nprotective of Tess. ",
        "Livvie: Yes, but I was talking \r\nabout me, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Of course you were, \r\nLivvie. ",
        "Livvie: Jack knows how \r\nterrified I was the last time Caleb was here and he knows how scar I I am, so \r\nhe's incredibly protective of me. ",
        "Rafe: Right, so -- so you think \r\nthat maybe it was flying outside the radar? No, listen to me. I don't want to \r\nhear how advanced your technology is, ok? I just want to find them. I -- ok. So \r\ncall me with any information you get. ",
        "Lucy: What?\r\n\n",
        "Jack: What'd they say? \n",
        "Lucy: What is going on? What is \r\n-- ",
        "Rafe: They can't find the \r\nplane. There's no communication. ",
        "Ian: What plane? What are you \r\ntalking about? ",
        "Jack: Caleb -- or Stephen -- \r\nwhoever that guy is -- got on the Barrington jet with Alison and her mother.\r\n",
        "Ian: What? ",
        "Lucy: Rafe, oh, my God. \n",
        "Livvie: That is -- that's \r\nreally terrible. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, and they \r\nthink that -- that the plane -- ",
        "Rafe: Went down! They think the \r\nplane went down. ",

        "Ricky: Are you crazy? I can't \r\nbelieve you're buying into this. ",
        "Marissa: Ricky, yes, you know, \r\nand maybe you should, too. ",
        "Jamal: You weren't even around \r\nwhen Caleb was in town, Ricky. He almost destroyed all of us. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, well, I've been \r\ndoing a little research on this vampire business of yours. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, really? Yeah? And so \r\nwhat? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, so what?\" So I went \r\nto the library, I checked out all the local newspapers, and guess what -- no \r\nvampires. No Caleb character. ",
        "Jamal: So -- we didn't want to \r\nfreak everybody out, so we kept it amongst ourselves.\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: Simple as that. So what?\r\n",
        "Ricky: But now you do? Now you \r\nwant to freak people out? ",
        "Jamal: What is your point?\r\n",
        "Marissa: Jamal was just trying \r\nto watch out for me, ok, Ricky? ",
        "Ricky: What about watching out \r\nfor yourself, Marissa, huh? I don't believe this. You're not going to leave a \r\nband that you love so much. ",
        "Marissa: It's -- it's really \r\nnot that important, really. ",
        "Ricky: Ah, that's a bunch of \r\nbull. ",
        "Jamal: Sometimes staying alive \r\nis a lot more important than some band. ",
        "Ricky: You really are nuts, \r\naren't you? ",
        "Jamal: You think so? \n",
        "Ricky: Yeah, I think so. You're \r\nafraid that she's going to become a star.\r\n\n",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Ricky: That's it, isn't it?\r\n",
        "Jamal: No, no, see, you need to \r\nget your head straight or you're going to be in some big-time trouble. Simple as \r\nthat, all right? ",
        "Ricky: And then you're jealous \r\nto top it off. ",
        "Jamal: I'm jealous? ",
        "Ricky: That's why you're \r\nscaring her. ",
        "Marissa: Ok, ok, ok -- \n",
        "jamal: I'm jealous? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, that's right --\r\n",
        "Marissa: Calm down! ",
        "Jamal: If you don't get out of \r\nmy face -- ",
        "Marissa: Calm down! ",
        "Ricky: What you going to do --\r\n",
        "Marissa: Ok, you guys, stop. \r\nRicky -- ok, this is my decision. I want this. All right, Jamal, can you just -- \r\nI need to talk to him for a second. Thank you.\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: I'm glad you got \r\npermison from daddy. ",
        "Jamal: Oh -- ",
        "Ricky: Marissa, I don't buy \r\nthis about you wanting to quit. ",
        "Marissa: Well, it's true, ok? I \r\ndon't want to be a part of something if Jamal thinks that it's going to be --\r\n",
        "Ricky: \"If Jamal thinks\"? What \r\nabout what you think, huh? ",
        "Marissa: We're a couple, Ricky. \r\nOk, we make decisions together. That's just how it is. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, and what happened \r\nto all that stuff you told me when I wanted to quit the band? ",
        "Marissa: That was different.\r\n",
        "Ricky: No, it's not different. \r\nOpen your eyes, Marissa. You're writing for one of the hottest bands in the \r\ncountry. I can't believe you want to give up a chance like that like I almost \r\ndid.\r\n\n",
        "Marissa: Ricky, we never even \r\nknew what we were getting into, all right? Maybe you should just -- you should \r\njust reconsider this whole -- ",
        "Ricky: \"Reconsider\"? \r\n\"Reconsider\"? No. No, I'm not going to reconsider. I really can't believe you're \r\ngiving up something that you love like that. ",

        "Ian: And which way was it \r\nheaded? ",
        "Rafe: They said north through \r\nCanada, but they were on their way to Chicago because Alison and her mother got \r\na lead on a sibling there. ",
        "Ian: How did Caleb end up on \r\nthis plane? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know! Why haven't \r\nthey called back? I got to find her. ",

        "Rafe: Ok, what's your rescue \r\nunit doing? No, that's not enough, ok? Where'd the plane go off the radar? Well, \r\ngive me the coordinates. Well, give me something! Because they might've \r\nsurvived, ok? ",
