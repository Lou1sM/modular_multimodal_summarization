        "Ian: He's gone. ",
        "Alison: Well, we'll find him. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok. Come on, let's split up. I'll check the bike shop, all right?\r\n",
        "Alison: Ok, ok. I think I might know where he is. ",

        "Livvie: Oh, I'm so sorry, Valerie. ",
        "Valerie: Here, let me help you. Oh, that's ok. ",
        "Livvie: I totally lost track of time. I'm trying to get all these papers \r\norganized for the bike shop and -- ah, thank you. I'm really sorry, but Jamal \r\nreally needs me to hurry back with these. ",
        "Valerie: No problem. ",
        "Livvie: Thanks. It was good to see you. ",
        "Valerie: Hey, say hi for me. Wait, Livvie, you forgot one! Livvie! \"DNA \r\nResults?\" What is this doing in with the papers for the bike shop? \"Jamal Woods \r\nand Hope?\" My Hope? My God. Jamal is Hope's real father. I got to find him. I \r\ngot to talk to him right now. ",
        "Livvie: Good girl, Valerie. It's all coming together, Caleb, one step at a \r\ntime. ",

        "Eve: I wonder if that poem your daddy recited to me is here. ",
        "P.A. Announcer: Dr. Thornhart, 6855. Dr. Ian Thornhart, 6855. ",
        "Ian: Hello? Hello? ",
        "Eve: Oh, my God. Ian, how -- how could you do this with her? ",

        "Kevin: Eve, it's me. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- Kevin. Uh -- ",
        "Kevin: Before you say anything, I just want to apologize again for last \r\nnight. I -- I came to pick up Danny. Victor called and said he got hung -- Eve? \r\nEve, are you all right? ",
        "Eve: Danny's sleeping. ",
        "Kevin: Eve, I know you well enough to know if something's wrong. ",
        "Eve: No, uh -- nothing's wrong. I'm ok. Really, everything's fine. ",
        "Kevin: What's that in your hand? ",
        "Eve: It's just an old picture. It's not important. ",
        "Kevin: Let me see it. ",
        "Eve: Kevin, how could they? ",
        "",
        "Valerie: Hold it right there. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, what's up? What's wrong with you? ",
        "Valerie: Ran a little DNA test, Jamal? You're Hope's father? ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Valerie: How long were you planning on keeping this a secret, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Where did you get this? ",
        "Valerie: How long have you known? ",
        "Jamal: Look, take it easy. Just a few days. ",
        "Valerie: \"Just?\" ",
        "Jamal: And it wasn't the DNA test that convinced me. Yeah, the DNA test was \r\nAli's idea. ",
        "Valerie: Ok, Ali? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I was going to go talk to the Hartmans about letting you see \r\nHope. Ok, but when I got there, when I saw her, I saw something that was really \r\nfamiliar. ",
        "Valerie: What are you talking about? ",
        "Jamal: Take a look. ",
        "Valerie: It's the same birthmark as -- ",
        "Jamal: Same as Hope's. Same spot, same everything. ",
        "Valerie: But why didn't you tell me? Why not right away? ",
        "Jamal: Because I've been doing some thinking. ",
        "Valerie: What do you mean? About? ",
        "Jamal: The future. Actually, Hope's future. Valerie, did you ever think that \r\nmaybe, just maybe it might be the right choice to stay out of Hope's life for \r\ngood? ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Jack, no! ",
        "Alison: Jack. Thank God. Listen, I -- I thought you might be here. Hey, how \r\ncould you just walk out of the hospital like that, huh? Everybody's really \r\nworried out of their minds. Huh? Jack? Hey -- hey, where are you going? Stop! \r\nHey, no more silent treatment! Just tell me what happened. ",
        "Jack: Catacombs. ",
        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Jack: No, no, no. No, get out of my head. Get out of my -- ",
        "Alison: Jack? ",
        "Jack: No! Get out of my head. ",
        "Alison: Stop! Just tell me what happened -- please? What did you see? Ok, why \r\nwere you there? Please? Just tell me. Please, don't you know how hard this is to \r\nsee you like this again? Just let me help you. ",
        "Jack: All I was trying to do was find out why -- why Livvie was acting so \r\nweird. ",
        "Alison: So you went to the catacombs. ",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: And did you find any answers there? ",
        "Jack: I found something -- ",
        "Alison: \"Something\" -- ",
        "Jack: Terrible. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jack: The box. ",
        "Alison: Ok, what was in the box? ",
        "Jack: Evil, darker than you could ever imagine. It's like I was looking the \r\ndevil right in the eyes. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Jack? What's going on? Our Jack? My Jack? What? ",
        "Ian: He came in with some kind of shock. I don't know what. We think there \r\nmight be brain trauma, but I didn't get to check him out because Kevin had to \r\npoke his nose in there. And now, I don't know, it's too late. ",
        "Lucy: \"I don't know, it's too late?\" Too late for what? ",
        "Ian: Jack took off because Kevin had to pull rank. ",
        "Lucy: Wow, things are starting to get a lot worse. I need to talk to you. I \r\nreally -- listen to me -- ",
        "Ian: No, wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Lucy: I need to ask you a favor. ",
        "Ian: Wait. I need to talk to you. I just need a minute. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, what are we doing here? You know what? I really -- ",
        "Ian: Wait a minute. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, uh, you first. ",
        "Ian: You know how much I care about you. You know that, but I just -- I need \r\nto know about -- ",
        "Lucy: About what? ",
        "Ian: Friends, right? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, we're friends. ",
        "Ian: Just -- just friends? ",
        "Lucy: Sort of really good friends. Where is this going? What -- what's wrong?\r\n",
        "Ian: I just -- I had to hear it from you. There's so much at stake now. ",
        "Lucy: I know that, but what are you talking about? ",
        "Ian: My family, my future. And, God, I hope I'm not jinxing this by talking \r\nabout it, but -- well, Eve and I, we're making progress. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Look at it. ",
        "Kevin: No. We've both seen enough of this to last a lifetime, believe me. ",
        "Eve: You knew? ",
        "Kevin: Eve, I hired the man who took the picture. ",
        "Eve: The private detective -- you had him follow Ian and Lucy? ",
        "Kevin: No. I had him follow Ian. Lucy was a bonus. Eve, I thought I'd burned \r\nthe whole set of pictures. I have no idea where this came from. ",
        "Eve: I don't care where it came from. I'm just glad I know. ",
        "Kevin: You are, huh? ",
        "Eve: I thought that he had betrayed me in every way that counted. That's why \r\nyou came over last night. That's why you were drunk and angry -- because you saw \r\nthat picture. ",
        "Kevin: But that's still no excuse for what -- ",
        "Eve: The hell it isn't! Look at this. I'm sick of it. I'm not going to let \r\nhim do this to me anymore. I keep letting him hurt me over and over and over \r\nagain. This time it's his turn. No one does this to me and gets away with it. No \r\none. ",
        "",
        "Jack: It felt like all the evil in the world was rushing through my body, \r\nseeping through my -- my skin, attacking me. ",
        "Alison: Whatever you saw, you survived it. ",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Alison: Ok? And you're going to be just fine. So we're going to go somewhere \r\nthat's got a lot of warmth and light -- ",
        "Jack: No. I got to do something first. ",
        "Alison: Well, then, I'll go with you. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no. All right, don't argue with me. Just go. I'm ok. ",
        "Alison: Are you sure? ",
        "Jack: Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I appreciate it. ",
        "Alison: No, I'll go only if you're absolutely -- ",
        "Jack: No, I'm fine. ",
        "Alison: Sure, Jack. ",
        "Jack: I'm fine. It's ok. Really. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Ok, so, I'll see you. ",
        "Jack: I'll call you. ",
        "Jack: This is always going to be with me. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Before I -- before I tear Ian out of my heart, I have to know. I have to \r\nknow if this is true, and I have to hear it from his lips. ",
        "Kevin: What do you have in mind? ",
        "Eve: I don't know, maybe some sort of truth serum or something. ",
        "Kevin: Wait, wait. Wait, Eve. Listen to yourself. Sodium pentothal is \r\ndangerous, and besides, it doesn't always work. ",
        "Eve: Sometimes it does. ",
        "Kevin: Well, we'll have to find another way. For Daniel's sake. ",
        "Eve: I have to live here with Ian and pretend like everything's ok so that I \r\ncan get Danny back. ",
        "Kevin: As long as Lucy and Ian don't know that we know, we can take our time \r\nuntil we figure out our next move. I have to get Danny back to my house before \r\nsomeone finds out he's here. Are you going to be all right? ",
        "Eve: Yes, as long as I know I'm not in this by myself. ",
        "Kevin: Trust me. ",
        "Eve: I do, with everything that means anything to me. ",
        "Kevin: We'll figure this out, one step at a time. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Call me. And -- and be careful with Danny and watch him, please. ",
        "Kevin: Like he's my own. Good night. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Eve: You bastard. Are all the horrible things that everyone has said about \r\nyou true? I have to find out. I've got to be sure. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I am very, very happy for you. I'm glad that you and Eve are working \r\nyour way back to each other, especially for Danny's sake. ",
        "Ian: Well, I -- thank you. All I want is a chance to share my life with Eve \r\nand Danny, that's all. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then, that's what I'm hoping you get with all my heart. ",
        "Ian: Ok. What did you want from me? You need me for something? ",
        "Lucy: You know, what it really was was I just -- I wanted to make sure you're \r\nok. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'm ok. I'm here. ",
        "Lucy: Good. And you know where you should be? You should go home and be with \r\nEve and make sure you know how much you love each other. I guess that's the best \r\nwe can do, huh? ",
        "Ian: I'm glad you're in my life. ",
        "Lucy: Just remember that you have meant so much to me, more -- more than I \r\ncould ever put into words. ",
        "Ian: \"Meant,\" past tense? ",
        "Lucy: Well, no, just that whatever happens in this crazy life, I want you to \r\nremember that good always overcomes evil and that the most important thing is to \r\nbe with the -- the people that you love. ",
        "Ian: Why are you making it sound like you're saying goodbye to me? ",
        "Lucy: I -- I didn't say goodbye. That word -- no. No, \"goodbye\" wasn't what I \r\nwas going for at all. Uh -- you know me. I was just -- I was getting a little \r\nsentimental, I guess. ",
        "Ian: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: I'm just happy for you. I really am, and you deserve some happiness. \r\nYou haven't had some in a long time and if getting back with Eve is it, then \r\nthat's what I hope for you. ",
        "Ian: And if Kevin is your man, for whatever reason, I'll -- I'll be hoping \r\nfor that, too. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks. You know, we can't ever be sure what the future holds. I mean, \r\nI have faith, though, that whatever is meant to happen is definitely going to \r\nhappen. ",
        "Ian: Well, what the future holds for me right now is me finishing my shift. \r\nStick around. Not finished with you. ",
        "Lucy: I plan on it. That's my plan anyway. That is my plan, but I'm not quite \r\nsure what the universe holds in store for me. I hope that's its plan, too. Ok. \r\nDo not show me the Stranger card. Oh, my God. The Grim Reaper. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Valerie, you're wrong about Ali. Ok, I do my own thinking. ",
        "Valerie: Then prove it. I know that we can't give hope all the things the \r\nHartmans can. But we can love her, and that's all that counts. She's ours. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa. What are you saying, Valerie? ",
        "Valerie: You have rights, Jamal. You didn't give her up officially. ",
        "Jamal: If you think I'm going to try to take Hope away from that family \r\nlegally, then -- ",
        "Valerie: No, no, no. Of course not. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. What do you want, then? ",
        "Valerie: Go and talk to them. Try to convince them that -- I need to see Hope \r\nevery once in a while. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? No. No, I don't think that'd be a good idea for Hope.\r\n",
        "Valerie: Then at least have them send me a picture sometime. Please, Jamal? \r\nIs that too much to ask? I'm begging you. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Ok. ",
        "Valerie: Thank you. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, we'll both go. Ok, but let's get this straight -- I will not break \r\nthat family apart. I'm only doing it so you can have some kind of contact with \r\nHope and, more importantly, so the Hartmans can have a copy of my medical \r\nrecords. ",
        "Valerie: And I'm fine with that. I just have one more thing to ask you, ok? \r\nIt's about Alison, all right? Not a word about this or what we've decided to do. \r\nThis is my life, this is my child, and I don't want her involved in any way. \r\nAgreed? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, yeah. Agreed. ",
        "Valerie: Promise? ",

        "Eve: Oh -- well, keeping up appearances. I thought it would be a good idea if \r\nI came by to pick you up for dinner if you're free. What do you say? ",
        "Ian: \"Keeping up appearances.\" Well, that's -- that's a good idea. ",
        "Eve: Good. ",
