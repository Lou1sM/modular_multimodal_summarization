        "Ian: This feels good. Coming home after a long day's work. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, just like old times. ",
        "Ian: We'll get back on track, you'll see. The only place I want to be is \r\nright here with you. ",
        "Eve's Voice: The private detective -- you had him follow Ian and Lucy? ",
        "Kevin's Voice: No. I had him follow Ian. Lucy was a bonus. ",
        "Eve's Voice: Before I tear Ian out of my heart, I have to know if this is \r\ntrue, and I have to hear it from his lips. ",
        "Kevin's Voice: What do you have in mind? ",
        "Eve's Voice: I don't know, maybe some sort of truth serum or something. ",
        "Kevin's Voice: Wait, wait, wait, Eve, listen to yourself. Sodium pentothal is \r\ndangerous and, besides, it doesn't always work. ",
        "Eve's Voice: Sometimes it does. ",
        "Kevin's Voice: Well, we'll have to find another way. ",
        "Eve: I want to trust you, Ian. I really do. Tonight I'm going to find out if \r\nyou're telling the truth. ",
        "",
        "Jack: \"The presence of evil can manifest as psychic energy. Vampires feed on \r\nfear as well as blood.\" Something evil has this town by the throat. I felt it \r\nmyself, and I got to find out if it's connected to Caleb. ",
        "",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Kevin: Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Hey, Doc. Call sounded pretty urgent. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, you tell me. I was sitting in here just minding my own \r\nbusiness when a wind blew in -- and, yes, the windows were closed -- and then I \r\nfound this tarot card. It just appeared out of nowhere. ",
        "Rafe: That's the Stranger card -- from Lucy's tarot deck? ",
        "Kevin: I've been trying to come up with a rational explanation. ",
        "Rafe: How's that going for you? ",
        "Kevin: Not good. Look, Lucy tried to warn me that Caleb was alive. She even \r\nclaimed she saw him. ",
        "Rafe: Well, she's a slayer. She has good instincts. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's what I need to know. Do you have the same instinct? Does \r\nthat card mean what I think? Is Caleb back? ",
        "Livvie: Don't say a word, Rafe. Not one word. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: James -- Caleb's very loyal but very dead servant. How can you be \r\nstanding there? ",
        "James: Well, as they say, you can't keep a good man down. ",
        "Lucy: It's -- it's impossible. ",
        "James: Unless you care to join me, leave this place. ",
        "Lucy: Well -- wait -- wait a minute. Why -- why the sudden rush? Why -- why \r\nshould I? I mean -- you have the sole purpose to protect your master, Caleb. So \r\nif you're here, if you're back, that means so is your little vampire buddy. ",
        "James: I don't converse with slayers. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, no, no, you don't. I see a bit of a furrowed brow, perhaps a \r\nlittle sweat there. Am I making you nervous there? Huh, James? What is it? Is it \r\n-- because Caleb is here, isn't he? Where is he? Where is your master, Caleb?\r\n",
        "",
        "Ian: I hope you like this dish I picked up in Morocco. Might be a little \r\nspicy. Might bring tears to your eyes. ",
        "Eve: Well, that shouldn't be too hard these days. ",
        "Ian: Bad choice of words. I'm sorry. ",
        "Eve: No, no, that's -- it was just a joke. It was a bad joke. But, you know, \r\nwe're getting things back on track, right? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Trying to work it out. ",
        "Eve: Uh -- I better get the matches to light the candles. ",
        "Ian: Here. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: Anything you need, anything at all, ok? ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: I just want to make you happy, that's all. ",
        "Eve: Then maybe we should not let the dinner get cold. ",
        "Ian: That dish is going to be hot for as -- I -- how about a toast? Yeah? \r\nHere. To a new beginning. ",
        "Eve: Ian, you don't have to try so hard. ",
        "Ian: But I do because I want us back the way we were. ",
        "[Music plays] ",
        "Eve: You know, sometimes as much as we might want it, as much as we might \r\nwant to recapture the past, it's hard. Especially when we have so many doubts \r\nabout each other. ",
        "Ian: I have no doubts about us. We deserve this, this evening. Now all I want \r\nis to dance with you. ",
        "Eve: Ian, I can't. ",
        "Ian: It's easy. Just hold on and -- ",
        "Eve: Ian, please? ",
        "Ian: It's just a dance, ok? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I don't want to hear Caleb's name mentioned ever again. He's not \r\nalive. He can't be. Don't you think I'd know if he was? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, calm down. ",
        "Livvie: Dad, do you know how hard I worked day and night trying to get rid of \r\nmy nightmares? Do you know what it's been like trying to get my life back to \r\nnormal? ",
        "Kevin: We just want you to be safe after everything you've been through, \r\nthat's all. And when Lucy got a feeling that Caleb might be back -- ",
        "Livvie: No, Dad, stop it! Stop using that horrible monster as an excuse for \r\neverything that goes wrong. ",
        "Rafe: All right, Livvie, that's enough. ",
        "Livvie: When it's raining out or when the car breaks down, you blame it on \r\nCaleb. When you and Lucy mess up your already crazy relationship, it's Caleb's \r\nfault. ",
        "Kevin: You're right. You're right. I guess it's easier to blame Caleb for our \r\nproblems than ourselves. ",
        "Rafe: But there have been signs, Dr. Collins. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, now I have my rational explanation -- we're projecting our \r\nfears on to Caleb. Honey, try and relax. I'll get you a glass of water, and, I \r\npromise, no more talk about vampires. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: And the award for best actress goes to Livvie Locke. Those tears -- a \r\nlittle over the top. ",
        "Livvie: Give it up, Rafe. You can't stop me -- or Caleb -- because your hands \r\nare tied. ",
        "Rafe: How can you be so sure about that? ",
        "Livvie: Because I know the big guys upstairs won't let you say anything to \r\nanybody in town about Caleb being alive. So, therefore, you are no threat to me.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Yeah, except people here are starting to figure that out on their own.\r\n",
        "Livvie: What, you mean that airhead Lucy? Caleb will keep her quiet. ",
        "Rafe: You really don't care who gets hurt, do you? ",
        "Livvie: Frankly, no. ",
        "Rafe: Are you enjoying this, being so cruel? ",
        "Livvie: You know what, Rafe? I'm not really interested in what you think, so \r\nyou can go back to where you came from because you have no power here. And get \r\nthe hell out of my way. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I knew it. I knew your creepy, conniving master was back, and you're \r\nliving -- well, not exactly living proof, are you? ",
        "James: How do you know I didn't come back alone -- or by myself to get even \r\nwith you for killing me? ",
        "Lucy: You know, I wasn't afraid of you when you were alive, and I'm certainly \r\nnot afraid of you now. ",
        "James: You don't want to see the powers I now possess. ",
        "Lucy: All I see is fear in those dead eyes of yours because you're protecting \r\nyour big boss, aren't you? And you -- you're just a musty, old, nasty ghost with \r\nattitude. ",
        "James: Can you be sure of that? ",
        "Lucy: I'm sure you're just protecting Caleb, and I'm sure you have no power \r\nover me because I am the slayer here. ",
        "James: Well, here's a news flash, dear -- slayers die, too. Don't you just \r\nhate the whole mortal thing? ",
        "Lucy: Don't knock it, dead man. ",
        "Lucy: You really are nothing but hot air. You know, you couldn't scare a \r\nlittle kid on Halloween. Come on, Jimmy Boy, you're going to have to come up \r\nwith something better than that. Come on! ",
        "Caleb: Lucy. It's so nice to see you again. ",
        "",
        "Ian: I don't remember holding you this close. ",
        "Eve: It does feel good. Um -- but, you know, if dinner's ready, we should \r\nprobably eat something. ",
        "Ian: Dinner can wait. I love you and I want you back. ",
        "Eve: Ian, please. ",
        "Ian: I'm not going to let you go, not without one hell of a fight. ",
        "Eve: Ian, stop. ",
        "Ian: Listen to me. You're going to have to fight, too. It's the only way we \r\ncan get it back. ",
        "",
        "Jack: This is hopeless. ",
        "Livvie's Voice: That's why I love you, Jack. You never gave up on me, even \r\nwhen I was so deep under Caleb's spell. ",
        "Jack's Voice: Caleb's gone. You have to start thinking about us -- me and you \r\n-- our future, and how much I love you. ",
        "Livvie's Voice: I love you, too. ",
        "Jack: Well, I still love you, Livvie. And I'd bet my life there's a \r\nconnection between Caleb and the strange way you've been acting. I have to find \r\na way to help you and I will. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Wait. You think you're going to win this, but you won't and neither \r\nwill Caleb. This whole thing, none of it's going to turn out the way you think.\r\n",
        "Livvie: It'll turn out exactly the way it has for centuries -- with Caleb \r\ncrushing his enemies, and you know what? I think I'll stick to the winning side.\r\n",
        "Rafe: You know, I never really believed in pure evil. I always held out hope \r\nthere was a little bit of good in everybody. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I spent my whole life being good and, Rafe, it's \r\noverrated. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. Wow! You are some piece of work. You know, when I look in your \r\neyes, I can actually see that you would hurt the people you love. ",
        "Livvie: In a heartbeat. ",
        "Rafe: But you know what? There's something else in there. ",
        "Kevin: Here you are, honey. ",
        "Livvie: Thank you. ",
        "Kevin: Look, everything's going to be all right. ",
        "Livvie: Dad, I really want to believe that. ",
        "Kevin: I know. ",
        "Rafe: I don't want to interrupt this charming moment. I'll let myself out.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Thank you. You feel better now? ",
        "Livvie: Can you just promise me one thing -- that we don't mention Caleb's \r\nname ever again? I want him as far out of my mind as I can get him. ",
        "Kevin: I'll never mention him again. He's dead and buried and that's exactly \r\nwere he's going to stay. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Oh, Caleb, I knew you were back. All this misery everybody's been \r\nfeeling has your name written all over it. ",
        "Caleb: You flatter me, but, alas, the end is near. And it would seem your \r\nlittle bag of tricks has failed you. So prepare for a dirt nap, Lucy, like so \r\nmany of your ancestors before you. ",
        "Lucy: Rafe showed me. You know, he has the power to do that. I saw myself \r\nrunning through the woods with you swooping down on me. ",
        "Caleb: Aw. Now the surprise is ruined. ",
        "Lucy: I got a few more surprises. This little movie that you've been making \r\n-- well, we're going to change your cheesy ending. ",
        "Caleb: \"Ending\" being the operative word. ",
        "Lucy: No, no. No more. I'm the producer. I get the final cut. Nobody in the \r\naudience really wants to see the well dressed heroine die. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, I do. ",
        "Lucy: Too bad. You don't get your way now. You've been terrorizing this town \r\nand planning and plotting. Well, guess what. I've been planning and plotting, \r\ntoo, and this little bag of tricks -- well, it's not quite empty. Ok. How do you \r\nlike the story now, Caleb? ",
        "Caleb: James, a little assist here. ",
        "Lucy: No one can help you now, Caleb. I am going to shoot you straight back \r\nto hell. Oh. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Kids are just so wonderful, aren't they? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well -- oh, yeah. You know, I'm sorry I upset you the way I did.\r\n",
        "Livvie: It's just, you know, that whole vampire thing. It really freaks me \r\nout, that's all. ",
        "Kevin: I'm really proud of the way you've pulled yourself together. ",
        "Livvie: I won't let Caleb win, Dad. ",
        "Kevin: And I know things didn't work out with Jack, but you'll find somebody.\r\n",
        "Livvie: You think? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I know it. And you'll make me the proudest grandpa in the whole \r\nworld. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I really want that. ",
        "Kevin: I've got to do some work upstairs. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Please let me watch Danny for you. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Just hang in there, Livvie. All your dreams are going to come \r\ntrue. Good night. ",

        "Eve: No. ",

        "Eve: I just wish that Danny were in the other room waiting for us to come in \r\nand tell him a goodnight story. ",
        "Ian: Well, very soon we'll tell that little boy a story with a happy ending.\r\n",
        "Eve: Will we, Thornhart? ",

        "Eve: I got to know the truth, Thornhart. Did you kidnap me? Did you plan to \r\nsteal our son? Did you have an affair with Lucy? ",
