        "Tess: It was her - Livvie. She \r\nburned my baby. ",
        "Jack: Why would you do that, \r\nLivvie? ",
        "Livvie: Why do you \r\nautomatically think I'm always the bad guy? ",
        "Jack: Tess, listen to me. I \r\nwant you to tell me exactly what happened with you two.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Livvie hurt me. She -- \r\nshe -- ",
        "Jack: Hey, it's ok. Just talk \r\nto me, ok? Just tell me. ",
        "Livvie: Will you stop badgering \r\nher, Jack? Tess, don't upset yourself, please. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, shut up. All \r\nright, you're not going to talk yourself out of this one. ",
        "Livvie: Ok, I did it. Tess is \r\nright. I -- I did a terrible thing to her. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: It's definite now. \n",
        "Alison: What is? ",
        "Rafe: I am never letting you \r\nout of my sight again. ",
        "Alison: Well, I think I can \r\nlive with that. ",
        "Rafe: I almost lost you in that \r\nplane crash.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: I know. I know. But, \r\nlook, I'm here now. I'm right here wityou, beside you. Feel me. I'm here. \n",
        "Rafe: I know, and I'm so glad \r\nabout that. ",
        "Alison: Well, at least \r\nsomething good came out of it, you know? I mean, I finally feel like I have a \r\nrelationship with my mother. I don't know what it was. We just started talking, \r\nand I just felt like all of a sudden that there was no more lies and there was \r\nno more games, and there was just this overwhelming sense of love. ",
        "Rafe: So she was really there \r\nfor you, huh? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, she really was. \r\nAnd Stephen was, too. Rafe, I know that might not make you happy, but he really \r\nwas. He was there for me, and I sort of feel like maybe I owe him just a little \r\nsomething --\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: No, no, you don't owe him \r\nanything. ",
        "Alison: I do. I do. Because he \r\nstopped me from bleeding to death, and he was afraid that I might have had a \r\nconcussion or something, and he kept me distracted by telling me some really \r\nfunny stories. I'm grateful for that. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The \r\nguy's real comedian, huh? ",
        "Alison: I was thinking that \r\nmaybe I might send him just, like, a little something, like some flowers or \r\nsomething. ",
        "Rafe: It's a bad idea. \n",
        "Alison: Well, maybe we could \r\ninvite Stephen and my mother -- ",
        "Rafe: No, Alison, no! All \r\nright, I don't want you anywhere near Stephen Clay. ",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Stephen. Oh --\r\n",
        "Stephen: I need you over here. \r\nLet's just say there's been a situation and a sudden change of plans.\r\n\n",

        "Livvie: I did it, ok? I burned \r\nTess' doll, and I'm sorry. ",
        "Jack: How could you be so \r\ncruel? ",
        "Livvie: Just let me finish. \r\nTess, I just -- I got really afraid, and I was scared. I thought you were going \r\nto take everything away from me. I thought you were going to hurt me, so I \r\nwanted to hurt you back. ",
        "Tess: But I -- I told you I \r\nwouldn't hurt you. ",
        "Livvie: I know. I understand \r\nthat now. But, see, sometimes I do things -- really bad things -- and I don't \r\nknow why. Tess, you've got to believe me. But I wasn't always like this. You \r\nprobably would have liked me if you met me before him, before Caleb.\r\n\n",
        "Jack: Ok, let's go. I've heard \r\nenough of Livvie's story here. Come on, Tess. All right, you're not going to pin \r\nthis off on some dead vampire, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but Caleb is \r\nstill in town, Jack. He just came back. He's Stephen Clay, remember? ",
        "Jack: Oh, so you're just going \r\nto go around ruining everybody's life again? Besides, we don't even know he's \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Livvie: My God, you are \r\nactually buying into this whole Stephen Clay act, aren't you? ",
        "Jack: No, what I'm not buying \r\ninto is your little act, and I know a whole lot more went down here than a burnt \r\ndoll. ",
        "Livvie: Can't you just be glad \r\nthat Tess is back and she's safe?\r\n\n",
        "Jack: No, Livvie, you had a \r\nproblem with Tess from the beginning. I know that you were involved in her \r\ndisappearance, and I want to know exactly what you did to her. ",
        "Tess: She saved me. ",
        "Jack: What? ",
        "Tess: Livvie saved me.",

        "\u00a0",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. I don't want \r\nto yell, but I meant what I said. You need to stay away from Stephen. \n",
        "Alison: Rafe, you did an \r\nextensive background check on him, and everything was legitimate. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I know. Those kind \r\nof things can be faked. ",
        "Alison: I really think that he \r\nis a nice person who is hiding behind this rock 'n' roll image.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: I can't believe it. I \r\ncan't believe he has gotten to you. ",
        "Alison: He has not gotten to \r\nme, but I just want you to -- ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- Alison, do you \r\nremember good Father Michael? You see, you all got to know Caleb's saintly side. \r\nSo just because he is being nice doesn't mean he's not a bloodsucking killer.\r\n",
        "Alison: Rafe, what are you \r\ndoing? It's almost like you want Stephen to be Caleb. That's it, isn't it? You \r\nreally want this fight whether it's real or not. ",
        "",
        "Joshua: What the hell happened \r\nhere? ",
        "Stephen: She wanted to leave \r\nme. I couldn't allow that. ",
        "Joshua: Did you have to turn \r\nher?\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Instinct -- \n",
        "Joshua: I thought we had a \r\nplan. ",
        "Stephen: Everything's still \r\nunder control. ",
        "Joshua: Right. Only now we have \r\na new recruit. And they always need so much attention. ",
        "Stephen: Elizabeth will never \r\nknow what she's become, and thanks to our little concoction here, no one will \r\never sense what she is. ",
        "Joshua: Aren't you putting a \r\nlittle too much faith in this wonder juice? ",
        "Stephen: It's worked like a \r\ncharm so far. ",
        "Joshua: So far. ",
        "Stephen: This has helped me, \r\nand it will help Elizabeth, too. ",
        "Joshua: Any more new recruits I \r\nshould know about? ",
        "Stephen: You're disappointed in \r\nme.\r\n\n",
        "Jouaua: It's a little more \r\ncomplex than that, Stephen. ",
        "Stephen: I said I get your \r\npoint! You just don't understand. I needed a companion. ",
        "Joshua: A companion who happens \r\nto be the future mother-in-law of a vampire slayer? I'd call that risky. \n",
        "Stephen: Maybe. But right now \r\nAlison thinks I'm a rock star with a heart of gold. And as long as Rafe's \r\nbabbling on and on about Caleb the vampire, well, the crazier and crazier he \r\nsounds. ",
        "Stephen: Why can't you deal \r\nwith our enemies in the old-fashioned way? Kill them? ",
        "",
        "Jack: What do you mean Livvie \r\nsaved you, Tess? ",
        "Livvie: She means that when I \r\nwent for a walk and I found her wandering down by the docks, she was lost and \r\ncold and really hungry, and I admit, Jack, I thought about letting her stay \r\nlost.\r\n\n",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, that makes \r\nsense to you. ",
        "Livvie: But then I saw how \r\nscared she was, and I knew how much she needed me, and I couldn't abandon her, \r\nso I bundled her up in my coat, and I took her home, but for a moment, I thought \r\nabout -- I could solve all my problems if I just let her wander away, but for \r\nonce, I -- I did the right thing. ",
        "Jack: Tess, did Livvie save \r\nyou? ",
        "Tess: Yes. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, hey, you can \r\nthank me later. But, listen, can you get her something to eat? Because I'm sure \r\nshe's starving right now. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Hey, you'll be ok. \r\nOk? I'll be right back.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Thank you so much. \r\nThank you for not telling Jack that I locked you in a trunk. I mean, you really \r\nsaved me, but I don't understand why. Why, Tess? You are so honest. Why did you \r\ndo that for me? ",
        "Tess: Because I think you're \r\nsorry, and I don't want to hurt you. ",
        "Livvie: Then it's true. We are \r\nconnected. I don't know how, but I -- I think we feel each other's pain so \r\nstrongly. ",
        "Tess: Caleb hurt you. I can \r\nfeel it. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. He told me he \r\nloved me and then pretty much destroyed my life. But you've met him before, Tess. \r\nThis is Caleb. ",
        "Tess: No. No, that's Stephen. \r\nHe -- he gave me my baby so I wouldn't be lonely.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: But I thought you said \r\nyou just met him. ",
        "Tess: My baby -- ",
        "Livvie: Oh, my God. Tess, when \r\nthis -- this Stephen talks to you, does it feel like you could follow him \r\nanywhere? ",
        "Jack: Ok, it's been a long day. \r\nI think Tess here needs to get some rest. I'll walk you out, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, Jack, wait. How \r\nlong has Tess had that doll? I mean, has she had it since you first met her?\r\n",
        "Jack: I get the feeling she's \r\nhad it pretty much forever. Why? ",
        "Livvie: Um -- no reason. I \r\npromise you I am going to stay out of your way, ok, from now on. I promise.\r\n",
        "Jack: Ok. Well, I hope you mean \r\nthat.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: How could Stephen have \r\ngiven Tess a doll she's had forever if they just met? ",
        "",
        "Rafe: Why would you think that \r\nI want Stephen to be Caleb? ",
        "Alison: Because you feel so \r\nalive when you're hunting evil, and it's what you were born to do. ",
        "Rafe: No, I was -- I was born \r\nto love you. This whole crushing evil thing is just a job. ",
        "Alison: Well, it's starting to \r\nconsume you. And I don't know, I thought that we wanted the same thing. I \r\nthought that we wanted the whole normal life thing. ",
        "Rafe: We do. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe it's just \r\nme. ",
        "Rafe: No. Now, listen to me. \r\nOur future together is the most important thing to me.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Then why are you trying \r\nto stir up trouble? Why can't you just enjoy life and stop trying to fight these \r\nbattles that aren't even there? ",
        "Rafe: Is that what you think \r\nI'm doing? ",
        "Alison: A little. I mean, I \r\njust want to focus on us. I want to focus on this wedding that coming up. \n",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I want that. I want \r\nthat, too. I want that. ",
        "Alison: I really want to find \r\nmy sister, which is what I set out to do before this even happened because I \r\nreally want some family up there with me at the altar when I exchange my \"I dos\" \r\nwith you. ",
        "Rafe: You can have it all. You \r\ncan have everything. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. Now, do you \r\nthink that maybe you could just start considering the possibility that Stephen \r\nis just a guy. He's just a normal man, and he's not this vampire that you think \r\nthat he might be?\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Stephen: You know, Joshua, for \r\nsuch an intelligent man, you lack real imagination. ",
        "Joshua: Why is it so important \r\nto you to win these people over? ",
        "Stephen: Because I'm tired of \r\nliving in the shadows all the time. I want to live in their world. And I want to \r\nbe loved. ",
        "Joshua: Beginning with Olivia.\r\n",
        "Stephen: Beginning with her.\r\n",
        "Joshua: She's betrayed you \r\nbefore. I'm afraid she'll betray you again. ",
        "Stephen: I'll never let a woman \r\nget to me like that again. ",
        "Joshua: It's too risky. Let me \r\nget rid of Olivia for you. ",
        "Stephen: You don't touch her. \r\nShe's mine.\r\n\n",
        "Joshua: Stephen -- ",
        "Stephen: This conversation is \r\nnow over. ",
        "Joshua: It looks like you \r\nalready have your hands full. ",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm -- oh. What \r\nhappened? ",
        "Stephen: You fainted. Probably \r\nstill a little shaken from the crash. Here. Can you drink this? It'll make you \r\nfeel better. ",
        "Elizabeth: Um -- before I \r\nfainted, I seem to remember something about breaking up with you? That can't be \r\ntrue. ",
        "Stephen: What do you want, \r\nElizabeth? Tell me what you want, and I'll give it to you. ",
        "Elizabeth: You. Just you.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Then you can have me \r\nforever. ",
        "Stephen: But right now you need \r\nto rest. You need your strength. ",
        "Stephen: Sweet dreams, \r\nElizabeth. ",
        "Stephen: It's time for me to go \r\nmake another appearance. I can't keep the fans waiting. After all, it's showtime.\r\n",
        "",
        "Jack: Listen, Tess, you trust \r\nme, right? Why don't you tell me what really happened between you and Livvie? I \r\nmean, because you were pretty upset when I walked in. ",
        "Tess: Livvie hurt my baby \r\nbecause she was sad, and I forgive her. ",
        "Jack: Well, you have a very \r\ngenerous heart, and that's great because you can forgive people. You don't hold \r\ngrudges, but, you know, I was really worried about you when I couldn't find you.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jack: No, no, I'm sorry that \r\nyou were scared. I wasn't there to protect you, keep you safe, because you know \r\nthat I would do anything for you. ",
        "Tess: Good. Because I want \r\nanother baby. ",
        "Jack: Ok. We will go to the \r\nstore first thing tomorrow morning and get you another baby. ",
        "Tess: No. Not at the store.\r\n",
        "Jack: Tess -- ",
        "Tess: I want a real baby. \r\nPlease? ",

        "Livvie: Caleb? Look, I know \r\nyou're here. Are you hanging from the rafters, or are you just curled up in your \r\ncoffin? You can change your name and your act, but I'm onto you. I'm onto you.\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Rafe: If it's that important to \r\nyou, then I will try to keep an open mind about Stephen. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. ",
        "Rafe: As long as you'll do the \r\nsame. ",
        "Alison: I'm done. ",
        "Rafe: Good. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Rafe. I \r\ndon't want to fight with you. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you know -- I've \r\nheard stories about how, when people fight sometimes, they make up. ",
        "Alison: I really can't remember \r\nhow that goes. I don't know. ",
        "Rafe: I think -- correct me if \r\nI'm wrong because I'm not really sure, either -- I think it's -- well, there's a \r\nlittle bit of this. And then some -- some of that. ",

        "Stephen: Well, she was feeling \r\na little exhausted from the ordeal, so I -- I suggested she stay back at the \r\nhotel and rest. ",
