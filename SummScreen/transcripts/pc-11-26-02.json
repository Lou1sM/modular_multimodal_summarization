        "Jack: A baby? I mean, you can't \r\n-- you can't be serious.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: A baby, Jack. A real \r\nbaby. ",
        "Jack: Do you even understand \r\nwhat that means? I mean, babies -- babies aren't like dolls. ",
        "Tess: I know. They come out of \r\nlove, and I love you very much. You, too? ",
        "Jack: Of course. Of course I \r\nlove you. ",
        "Tess: Then what I want is good.\r\n",
        "Jack: Tess -- ",
        "Tess: Jack, please, let's make \r\na baby. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: You know, you scared \r\nme. I -- I didn't think anyone was around. ",
        "Joshua: Well, someone is around \r\nand he couldn't care less whether you're scared or not. You're trespassing.\r\n",
        "Livvie: You look so familiar.\r\n\n",
        "Joshua: Can I help you with \r\nsomething? ",
        "Livvie: Yes, um -- I guess you \r\ncan. As a matter of fact, I'm here to see Stephen. ",
        "Joshua: Young lady, you're \r\nwasting your time and mine. Mr. Clay is not available. ",
        "Livvie: So when will he be?\r\n",
        "Joshua: You know, at least 12 \r\nwomen have asked me the same question in the past 24 hours. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I'm not just some \r\ngroupie. ",
        "Joshua: I know who you are.\r\n",
        "Livvie: So then you are well \r\naware that Stephen and I know each other. And if he's here, I would really like \r\nto speak with him. ",
        "Joshua: Tell me what you need \r\nwith Stephen and I'll make sure he gets -- ",
        "Livvie: Look, it's personal.\r\n\n",
        "Joshua: I suggest you pack up \r\nyour pretty little personal and you take it elsewhere. I'll let Stephen know \r\nthat you've been here -- ",
        "Livvie: Look, I am not going \r\nanywhere. ",
        "Joshua: You're making a \r\nmistake. ",
        "Livvie: I said I'm waiting \r\nhere. I'm not going anywhere. ",
        "Joshua: I can see that. \n",
        "Stephen's voice: I'm tired of \r\nliving in the shadows all the time, and I want to be loved. ",
        "Joshua's voice: Beginning with \r\nOlivia? ",
        "Stephen's voice: Beginning with \r\nher. ",
        "Joshua's voice: She's betrayed \r\nyou before. I'm afraid she'll betray you again. ",
        "Joshua: On second thought, I \r\ndon't think you should go anywhere, either.\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. ",
        "Stephen: Well, Elizabeth, what \r\na surprise. ",
        "Elizabeth: Sorry to barge in on \r\nyou like this, but my bed was just so lonely without you. ",
        "Stephen: You're doing too much. \r\nAfter everything you've been through, you should really be back at the hotel \r\nresting. ",
        "Rafe: He's right, Elizabeth. \r\nI've never seen you look like this. ",
        "Alison: Or act like this.\r\n",
        "Rafe: You look very pale. \r\nDoesn't she, Stephen? ",
        "Stephen: Perhaps a touch.\r\n",
        "Rafe: No, she does. It's almost \r\nlike, well, the blood is drained out of her face. ",
        "Stephen: So you're -- you're a \r\ndoctor and a vampire slayer. ",
        "Ian: All right. How's my \r\nfavorite patient? What's going on here? Did I walk in on something?\r\n\n",
        "Alison: No, you didn't. \r\nEverything's fine. ",
        "Rafe: Actually, it's a good \r\nthing you're here. Elizabeth isn't feeling very well. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm fine. \n",
        "Ian: Is that right? What's the \r\nmatter with you? ",
        "Rafe: Well, I was hoping you \r\ncould tell us that. Actually, I think we would all feel better if we knew what \r\nwas making Elizabeth feel so strange. Right, Stephen? ",
        "[Captioning made possible by \r\nabc, inc.] ",
        "",
        "Joshua: Well, if you're going \r\nto wait, I have some time. Do you mind if I keep you company? ",
        "Livvie: So, exactly what is it \r\nyou do for the Stephen Clay Experience? ",
        "Joshua: I am the manager.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: That's why you look \r\nfamiliar. You're Joshua, aren't you? At the Halloween party, you asked me to \r\ndance? ",
        "Joshua: Right. ",
        "Livvie: For a second there, I \r\n-- I thought that maybe you were someone else. ",
        "Joshua: Were you disappointed \r\nwhen you discovered that I wasn't? ",
        "Livvie: No. Not at all, \r\nactually. I bet you and your band were pretty shocked when that guy jumped up \r\nonstage and told everyone that your frontman was a vampire. ",
        "Joshua: No, not at all. We \r\nenjoy the notoriety. Sales of our C.D. Jumped 11%. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I can \r\nunderstand why. I mean, I think it's all kind of cool. I actually like the idea \r\nof vampires.\r\n\n",
        "Joshua: Really? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I was close to \r\none once. ",
        "Joshua: Ah, now you are teasing \r\nme. Next you'll be telling me that you believe in angels. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, doesn't \r\neveryone? But I am more of a vampire type of girl. That's why I can't get my \r\nmind off of your boss. ",
        "Joshua: I'm not quite sure I \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Livvie: You see, Stephen looks \r\nexactly like the one I used to know. In fact, they're identical. ",
        "Joshua: Oh, please, not you, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Livv: No, no, listen, it gets \r\n-- it gets better, actually. There's actually a girl who showed up in town who \r\nlooks exactly like me, and she just so happened to come at the exact same time \r\nStephen did.\r\n\n",
        "Joshua: Incredible. What an \r\namazing coincidence. ",
        "Livvie: I think there might be \r\na connection. ",
        "Joshua: Well, I'm sure you will \r\ninvestigate and investigate until you get all the answers. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, yeah, I plan on it, \r\nall right. ",
        "Joshua: I'm sure you do. \n",
        "Ricky: Hey, Josh? Hey, I'm \r\nsorry I'm late, man. ",
        "",
        "Rafe: You do want to make sure \r\nshe's all right, don't you, Stephen? ",
        "Stephen: Oh, I'm sure it's \r\nnothing serious. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm fine. \n",
        "Alison: You do look a little \r\npale, mother, and Ian really is the best doctor. ",
        "Stephen: I'm sure Dr. Thornhart \r\nhas a very busy schedule. Maybe we should --\r\n\n",
        "Ian: No, no, it's all right. \r\nIt's all right -- Stephen, is it? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: I have time. ",
        "Rafe: Great. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Just got to move a \r\nfew things around. Can I talk to you for a moment? Excuse us. ",
        "Alison: You'll see, mother. Ian \r\nis really, really an awesome doctor. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sure he is.\r\n",
        "Stephen: You are feeling a \r\nlittle warm? ",
        "Elizabeth: I am. ",
        "Stephen: A little drink. If \r\nyou're running a fever, maybe this will help cool you down a bit. ",
        "Elizabeth: Good. I'm dying of \r\nthirst. ",
        "Alison: Thank you, Stephen, for \r\ntaking such good care of my mother.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: I wouldn't have it any \r\nother way. ",
        "Ian: Ok, out with it. Why is \r\nchecking Elizabeth so important? ",
        "Rafe: I think maybe he's \r\nalready turned her into a vampire. She's really showing the signs of someone \r\nthat had just been bitten. Now, I don't have any proof and I'm not getting the \r\nfeelings that I usually get when there are vampires -- ",
        "Ian: You think if I examine \r\nher, then -- ",
        "Rafe: Well, I'm not sure what \r\nwill show up, but I do know that if Caleb -- Stephen, or whoever he is -- has \r\nbitten her, she won't let you draw blood. See, a vampire will do anything to \r\nstop you from taking it. ",
        "Ian: And if she won't let me \r\ndraw blood , it would prove that, what?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Caleb's back. ",
        "Ian: It would also prove that \r\nAlison's mother is a vampire.",

        "Jack: Look, Tess -- cover your \r\nbaby. Don't get me wrong, I love babies. See? ",
        "Tess: Love. ",
        "Jack: Love, yeah. And we know \r\nthat we love each other. And one of the most important things a couple needs to \r\nhave is love when it comes to making a baby. ",
        "Tess: The most important thing.\r\n",
        "Jack: But it's not all they're \r\ngoing to need. ",
        "Tess: Then we'll get it. \n",
        "Jack: Um, yeah. Well, it's \r\nreally -- it's not that easy. See, a baby -- a real baby -- needs to have a \r\nfamily.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Well, we have a family. \r\nYou, your brother, Chris, and -- and I have Livvie, and that's family. \n",
        "Jack: But a real baby is -- is \r\na huge, huge commitment, Tess. A really big commitment, and it really changes \r\nyour entire life. ",
        "Tess: I don't understand.\r\n",
        "Jack: Look, come here. When a \r\nbaby comes into this world, it needs a family who not only loves each other but \r\nis also committed to each other. Do you know what being married means? \n",
        "Tess: Yeah. ",
        "Jack: You do? ",
        "Tess: Ian, um, was married and \r\nthen he had Danny. ",
        "Jack: Right. Danny. Exactly.\r\n",
        "Tess: So? ",
        "Jack: Do you understand what \r\nI'm trying to say?\r\n\n",
        "Tess: I understand. ",
        "Jack: I'm glad. ",

        "Joshua: Tomorrow night, \r\nremember? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, that's tomorrow \r\nnight? Dude, I'm sorry. I can't keep it straight with all the partying and \r\npracticing. ",
        "Joshua: You got to get it \r\ntogether, Ricky. This is a job, this is not a hobby. ",
        "Ricky: I said I was sorry.\r\n",
        "Joshua: All right, I heard you. \r\nNow leave. ",
        "Ricky: Fine. You want me to \r\nleave? God, chill out. Livvie. Hey.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Hi, Ricky. ",
        "Ricky: Long time no see. This \r\nyour first time here? You come to see where we make the magic? ",
        "Livvie: I'm waiting for \r\nStephen. ",
        "Ricky: Well, you know, Joshua \r\nhere is a very busy man. Why don't you come get a bite to eat with me? \n",
        "Joshua: That won't be \r\nnecessary. I'm sure if you go out there, you'll find some fellow parasite who \r\nwill be willing to keep you company. ",
        "Ricky: You know what, Joshua? \r\nWhy don't you let the lady decide? ",
        "Joshua: Judging by the \r\nexpression on her face, I think she's already made her decision. ",
        "Livvie: Bye, ricky. ",
        "Ricky: Fine. Suit yourself. I'm \r\nsorry I interrupted.\r\n\n",

        "Livvie: Well, I thank you very \r\nmuch for getting rid of him. That was very kind of you. ",
        "Joshua: Well, then, you were \r\ntelling me your theory on -- ",
        "Livvie: Vampires. ",
        "Joshua: Yes. Well, I was rather \r\nenjoying that. I'd like to continue. ",
        "Livvie: My favorite subject.\r\n",
        "Joshua: If you don't think I'm \r\nas presumptuous as Ricky was, perhaps we could continue over dinner. ",

        "Elizabeth: Better. So much \r\nbetter. Thank you. ",
        "Ian: Hmm. ",
        "Elizabeth: I am so sorry about \r\nthe way that I was acting. That fever just had me doing the strangest things.\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Well, your temperature is \r\nfine now. ",
        "Elizabeth: Good. I guess I just \r\nneeded a little water and some rest, huh? Hope I didn't embarrass Stephen too \r\nmuch. ",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sure you \r\ndidn't. You know, he's a rock star. ",
        "Ian: Stephen -- you know, I \r\ncan't look at the boy without seeing Caleb Morley. ",
        "Alison: I know what you mean, \r\nIan. I mean, I thought the same thing up until the crash. But I was really hurt \r\nand so was mother, and he really helped us. I mean, he helped stop my bleeding, \r\nand if it were Caleb, I'm not so sure that he would've -- ",
        "Ian: Right. Right, right. So no \r\ndoubts about Stephen, then?\r\n\n",

        "Stephen: Pretty ironic coming \r\nfrom the guy that does nothing but. ",
        "Rafe: You know what, you can \r\nkeep up this whole Stephen Clay thing for as long as you want. The thing is I \r\nknow you're Caleb and 's's going to come out soon. You're going to make a \r\nmistake.\r\n\n",

        "Tess: Because I'm not as smart \r\nas you. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no. No, Tess, \r\nyou're very smart. You're very smart. And I think it's just maybe I have a \r\nlittle more experience when it comes to dating and, you know, going on dates.\r\n",
        "Tess: Dates? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, um -- Tess, I don't \r\nknow. I -- I just think we need to -- to wait before we start talking about \r\nmaking a baby. ",
