        "Alison: Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Where do you think you're going? ",
        "Jamal: I got an errand I have to run this morning. ",
        "Alison: An errand? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Where? What? ",
        "Jamal: I'm riding to irvington for a part. ",
        "Alison: Irvington. Wow. Aren't you dedicated? Is it any wonder that I -- I \r\nlove you so much, huh? ",
        "Jamal: I love you, too. I love you, too, baby, but i got to jam, ok? ",
        "Alison: Oh, well, why don't i come with you? You can use some company. I \r\nhaven't had a ride in forever. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I can'T. ",
        "Alison: Uh-huh. ",
        "Jamal: I mean, you can'T. ",
        "Alison: What? Why? ",
        "Jamal: I mean -- you're working. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, I just thought maybe i could get somebody to cover me, \r\nthough. But that is a stupid idea, i can see, because we need the money. ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm, and, you know, we'll do it some other time. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Ok? And someplace a lot more inspiring than irvington. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Ok. ",
        "Jamal: All right? ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Talk to you later. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Yo. ",
        "Alison: Bye. ",
        "Jamal: Bye. ",
        "Valerie: Hey, jamal. ",
        "Jamal: What are you doing here? What are you -- I told you i was coming to \r\npick you up. ",
        "Valerie: I thought I'd save you the trouble. ",
        "Jamal: Trouble's what we're going to have if alison sees me leaving with you.\r\n",
        "Valerie: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jamal: You know what? I never should've lied to her to begin with. I hate \r\nthis. Everybody about this, I hate. ",
        "Valerie: Jamal, i never would have asked you this if i wasn't so scared. I \r\nmean, this is probably my only shot at getting the hartmans to change their \r\nminds about hope. If alison did anything to interfere, I would -- ",
        "jamal: Ok, ok, ok. Ok, I won't say anything. ",
        "Valerie: Thank you. ",
        "Jamal: For now. But as soon as we get this settled with the hartmans -- ",
        "valerie: Fine. Whatever. Let's just go see our little girl. ",
        "[Pounding on door] ",
        "kevin: All right, all right, ",
        "ght. ",
        "Jack: Where's lucy? I need to see lucy. ",
        "Kevin: Jack. Lucy's not here, but i've been looking for you ever since you \r\ndisappeared from the hospital. ",
        "Jack: I said where is she? I've got to find her. ",
        "Kevin: Jack, take it easy. Are you all right? ",
        "Jack: No, I'm not all right. Nobody is because caleb is back! ",
        "Kevin: Sounds like you've already been talking to lucy. ",
        "Jack: She knows, doesn't she? I knew lucy would know it. ",
        "Kevin: No, jack, she doesn't know anything. She has feelings, suspicions, \r\nwhich I got caught up in for a while until i realized that there wasn't one \r\nshred of proof anywhere. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, there is proof. You're wrong. There is. ",
        "Kevin: No, there isn'T. There's only paranoia, which is going to be mass \r\nhysteria soon. ",
        "Jack: No, listen to me. Caleb is back and we have to put him away for good \r\nthis time. Where's the slayer? I need the slayer. ",
        "Rafe: How did this happen, huh? I was supposed to be lucy's guardian angel. \r\nYou tell me, how did things get so out of control? Because, god help me, this is \r\nthe last thing i ever thought i'd have to do. ",
        "Livvie: I must've dozed off. ",
        "Caleb: Slaying a slayer can take a lot out of a person. ",
        "Livvie: Ah. I was hoping it wasn't just a dream. ",
        "Caleb: It was a dream. Only you made it come true. ",
        "Livvie: Oh. Come on, it wasn't so tough. I mean, sure, lucy did put up a \r\nfight, but i knew you were counting on me. She never had a chance. Can life \r\npossibly get any better? I mean, slayer woman's dead, the rest are circling the \r\ndrain, and you -- my love, you've got your fangs back. ",
        "Caleb: There is one thing still missing. ",
        "jack: Look, you better face the facts because if you don't, caleb's going to \r\ntake us all out. ",
        "Kevin: That's just it, jack, there are no facts. No one has seen him. No one \r\nhas any proof at all. ",
        "Jack: I don't need any proof because I know caleb is back. ",
        "Kevin: All right, jack. Then just tell me how do you know? ",
        "Jack: Because I went to the catacombs. And when i went there, i saw the music \r\nbox. ",
        "Kevin: The music box? ",
        "Jack: Yes, the music box, and when i opened it, I saw evil -- caleb's evil. \r\nAnd that's when you saw me at g.H. That's why i was so messed up when you saw me \r\nat the hospital. ",
        "Kevin: Jack, listen to me. ",
        "Jack: No! You listen to me. Our blood-sucking friend is back! He's alive. I \r\nknow he's alive. ",
        "Kevin: All right, jack. Jack? Just think about it. Think. If that were true, \r\nlivvie would've heard from him. After all, caleb does consider her his wife. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, no. She's not his wife. ",
        "Kevin: Regardless, we've contacted her and she told me that he hasn'T. ",
        "Jack: No, she told you what you wanted to hear. For some reason, she's \r\nprotecting him. ",
        "Kevin: Why? Jack, come on! Why would she -- ",
        "jack: Because she's trying to help him! ",
        "Kevin: Help him? ",
        "Jack: Yes! ",
        "Kevin: Why would you think that? ",
        "Jack: Because she tried to kill me! Livvie tried to kill me. ",
        "Livvie: Just tell me what you want, and I'll make sure you have it. ",
        "Caleb: All I've ever wanted is a love like this, the kind of love you've \r\ngiven me. ",
        "Livvie: I feel the same way. ",
        "Caleb: And I think about all you've done, all you've sacrificed. ",
        "Livvie: Now, what have i sacrificed? ",
        "Caleb: You left jack. ",
        "Livvie: I wanted to. ",
        "Caleb: And you helped break apart your friends, ian and eve, so that soon \r\nwe'll have our child. ",
        "Livvie: Our son. ",
        "Caleb: Mm-hmm. You even turned on your own father. But when i think about \r\nlast night, what you did last night, destroying one of our most powerful enemies \r\n-- ",
        "livvie: And did it with pleasure, my love. I would have done anything to \r\nbring you back to me fully, show you that nothing in this world matters except \r\nyou. ",
        "Caleb: Olivia. ",
        "Livvie: And I know the one last thing you still want. I know and i want it, \r\ntoo. ",
        "H0 8 ",
        "jamal: You know, val, I've been thinking. When we get to the hartmans', maybe \r\nyou should let me do most of the talking. ",
        "Valerie: Oh, yeah? Why's that? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I just don't want to scare them off. You know? I mean, the way \r\nthey were freaking on you and the way you were freaking on them and everything, \r\nwe just -- ",
        "valerie: Ok, yeah, yeah, you're right. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Valerie: Once they find out you're hope's daddy, it doesn't matter who tells \r\nthem. They're going to flip out anyway, knowing what that means, that you have \r\nrights and -- ",
        "jamal: Look, I'm going to put their minds at ease right away, ok? I'm not \r\nthere to take away their baby. Ok, I just want them to honor their original \r\nagreement and let you have some contact with the baby. That's it. ",
        "Valerie: Well, what about you? ",
        "Jamal: What about me? ",
        "Valerie: She's your daughter, jamal. Don't you want to know how she's getting \r\nalong, what she's going to grow up to be like? Whether she'll take after you or \r\nme or your mama? Will you honestly be able to go in there and look in your \r\nlittle girl's eyes and then just walk away? ",
        "Alison: Hey, rafe. Hi. I didn't even see you sitting there. What's going on?\r\n",
        "Rafe: Hey, alison. How are you doing? What's up? ",
        "Alison: Well, actually, I sort of might be being a little bit paranoid and \r\nall, but I kind of feel like that maybe jamal's got something going on, and \r\nsince you have such really good insight with everything, i sort of wanted to run \r\nit past you, although right now you don't look so hot. Are you ok? ",
        "Rafe: Did you ever feel like you're just a complete and utter failure? ",
        "Alison: Huh. Yeah. You having a low self-esteem day, huh? ",
        "Rafe: I'm serious. ",
        "Alison: I know. ",
        "Rafe: There's so many things in this world that are just so messed up. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it. ",
        "Rafe: Really. I mean, really unfair. ",
        "Alison: Rafe, what's going on? ",
        "Rafe: You wouldn't believe me if i told you. ",
        "Alison: Oh, try me. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: I can't because that would be braking one of those oh-so-precious \r\nrules. ",
        "Alison: Oa -- what -- what rules? What are you talking about? ",
        "Rafe: Alison, you know what? You're a really good friend and I know you're \r\njust trying to help, but -- but you can'T. ",
        "Alison: What -- whoa. ",
        "Rafe: No one can. ",
        "Alison: Rafe? Wait, rafe, you forgot your journal -- from 1991. Why would you \r\nbe carrying around a journal from 1991 that ends april 12? What's -- what's up \r\nwith that? Well, I'm sure whatever it is it's very important and you need it. So \r\n-- hey, I'll be right back, ok? ",
        "Kevin: What do you mean livvie tried to kill you? ",
        "Jack: She had me meet her at the recovery room. Ok, she ordered me a drink \r\nand thank god I didn't drink it because it turns out she put poison in it. ",
        "Kevin: You saw livvie put poison in your drink? ",
        "Jack: Well, I didn't actually see her put -- ",
        "kevin: Well, then how do you know if you didn't drink it? Did you have it \r\nanalyzed? ",
        "Jack: Look, I don't have time for any questions. I'm telling you the truth. \r\nShe wanted me dead! ",
        "Kevin: Why? ",
        "Jack: Because obviously she's back with caleb. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. Ok. I think I see what this is about. You're hurting over your \r\nbreakup. I can understand that. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, no, no. You got to help me. You got to believe me. You \r\ndon't, do you? Damn it. Ok, fine. Then i'll take care of this myself. ",
        "Kevin: All right, jack -- jack, wait. It's not that I don't believe you. But \r\nif we're going to deal with this, we have to do it calmly. Panic won't get us \r\nanywhere. ",
        "Jack: Right, right. I know that. ",
        "Kevin: All right, why don't you take a few minutes, put some water on your \r\nface, calm down, and then we'll talk about it. We'll figure out what to do. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right. I just need to get control of my head.\r\n",
        "Kevin: In the meantime, I'll see if I can track down lucy. ",
        "Jack: Look, thanks, dr. Collins. Thanks for your help. ",
        "Kevin: This is dr. Kevin collins. I need an ambulance at my home right now. \r\nThere's a young man here, delusional -- ",
        "jack: You said you believed me. You lied. ",
        "Kevin: Jack, you've been through a lot. And I think you need some help. ",
        "Jack: No, you're making a big mistake. You'll see. You'll all see. ",
        "Livvie: Caleb, what's wrong? ",
        "Caleb: We can't do this, not yet. ",
        "Livvie: Come on. After everything i've done. Don't you still want me? ",
        "Caleb: I want you so bad right now that i could take you and just get lost in \r\nyou forever. ",
        "Livvie: Well, then, why? ",
        "Caleb: We got to stay strong. We can't afford to get vulnerable, not when \r\nwe're so close. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. You said there's still one thing left to do. ",
        "Caleb: And there is -- one very important thing. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. Ok, just tell me what it is. I am yours to command. ",
        "Caleb: It's time, olivia. It's time for the grand finale. ",
        "Livvie: What do you have in mind? ",
        "Caleb: Oh. We're about to show everyone who tried to destroy us exactly who \r\nthey're dealing with. We're going to show them the power of true eternal love. \r\nAnd when i'm done with them, they're going to wish they never walked this earth.\r\n",
        "Valerie: You still haven't answered my question. ",
        "Jamal: What question? ",
        "Valerie: What are you going to do about hope? Do you want to be a part of her \r\nlife? ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, come on. What do you want me to say? I mean, of course a part \r\nof me wants to be a part of her life. ",
        "Valerie: But the other part -- ",
        "jamal: Just knows i'd be complicating her life. I mean, the little girl \r\ndoesn't even know me. ",
        "Valerie: Kids aren't complicated, jamal. You love them and they love you \r\nback. And frankly, i don't think it's possible to have too many people around to \r\nlove them and want the best for them. ",
        "Jamal: All right, look, let's just go to the hartmans' and see how that goes \r\nfirst, ok? ",
        "Valerie: Sure. I mean, you don't have to decide this minute, right? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, but no matter what, I don't want to freak these people out. Ok? So \r\ni think we should give them a call and let them know we're coming first. ",
        "Valerie: No, no. I don't think that's a good idea at all. ",
        "Jamal: Look, val, i'm just trying to make this -- ",
        "valerie: I don't want to give them any warning. ",
        "Jamal: I'm just trying to make this as nonthreatening as possible -- if you \r\nwant to have any hope of getting what you want. ",
        "Valerie: No pun intended? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Valerie: All right, all right, have it your way. Let's go. ",
        "Jamal: All right. You got the number? ",
        "Valerie: Yeah. I got it right here. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Valerie: Well, what happened? Did you get the machine? Why didn't you leave a \r\nmessage? ",
        "Jamal: Val, the number's been disconnected. ",
        "Valerie: Oh, my god. They're gone. They've taken off with our daughter, jamal. \r\nWhat are we going to do? ",
        "Rafe: You know, I've told you this before, but now i know it's really true -- \r\nyour rules are a crock. You hear that? They're worthless. Poor little guy. At \r\nleast i can fix you. ",
        "Alison: How did you do that? Who are you, rafe? Who are you, really? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, it's kevin. Call me as soon as you get this. I need to talk to \r\nyou right now. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, dad. What's going on? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, jack was just here. And he was acting pretty crazy. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that's not too surprising. The last time I saw him, he accused \r\nme of trying to poison him. I think with all the stuff that's going on, he's \r\nreally finally starting to crack. ",
        "Kevin: That's what I thought at first, but -- ",
        "[kevin sighs] ",
        "livvie: But what? ",
        "Kevin: I haven't been able to reach lucy. And we're not exactly close these \r\ndays. But I can't seem to find her anywhere and that worries me. ",
        "Livvie: No, dad, lucy's fine. I just spoke to her. ",
        "Kevin: You did? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. She went to the spa to unwind. I think with everything that's \r\ngoing on, she really needed a break. ",
        "Kevin: Of course, of course. That's what she'll do when the going gets tough. \r\nThe tough get massaged. ",
        "Livvie: And she also said that when she gets done, she wants to see you. ",
        "Kevin: She say why? ",
        "Livvie: Something about getting together and settling things once and for \r\nall. ",
        "Jack: Look, come out, you bastard! I know you're back, caleb. Why don't you \r\nbe a man and show yourself? Quit hiding behind a woman and face me! ",
        "Caleb: Did you miss me? ",
        "Jack: How? How -- how did -- ",
        "caleb: You have to thank olivia. She's the one responsible. ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Caleb: Of course, being my wife, she responded to my call. ",
        "Jack: No, livvie didn't do that, you made her. ",
        "Caleb: I didn't make her do anything, jack. She brought me back of her own \r\nfree will, just like she's done a lot of little things for me, like try to kill \r\nyou. That's right, jack. She was so desperate to prove her love. And bless her \r\nlittle heart, that's what she decided to do. ",
        "Jack: She didn't prove it very well, did she? Because I'm still here. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, that's only because you had help from the other side. ",
        "Jack: What are you talking about? ",
        "Caleb: Hmm, that's for the big boys to know. You don't qualify. ",
        "Jack: Oh. You know, caleb, my one regret when i thought you were dead was \r\nthat i wasn't going to be able to kill you myself. ",
        "Caleb: A great line. How long you been waiting to use that one? ",
        "Jack: It's over, caleb. The slayer's onto you. ",
        "Caleb: Ooh. The slayer. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, the slayer. Lucy. Remember her? This time, she's going to do away \r\nwith you for good. ",
        "Caleb: Well, I hate to burst your bubble, little man, but lucy is dead. ",
        "Jack: No. No, I don't believe you. ",
        "Caleb: You have to trust me. I tasted her blood myself. ",
        "Jack: You son of a -- ",
        "caleb: Oh, well, you know, it's not like I spilled it, jack. That was olivia.\r\n",
        "Jack: Livvie? ",
        "Caleb: She insisted. ",
        "Jack: No. No, it can't be. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, how I -- how I do love this moment, jack -- that realization that \r\nyou know you've lost. Don't you get it? I won, jack. I won. Not so fast, my \r\nfriend. Just because the game's over doesn't mean we still can't have some fun. \r\nYou see, olivia and I are throwing a little party and we just wouldn't want you \r\nto miss it. ",
