", "Alison: Yeah. Well, I just thought maybe i could get somebody to cover me, though. But that is a stupid idea, i can see, because we need the money. ", "Jamal: Mm-hmm, and, you know, we'll do it some other time. ", "Alison: Ok. ", "Jamal: Ok? And someplace a lot more inspiring than irvington. ", "Alison: Oh. Ok. ", "Jamal: All right?

Everybody about this, I hate. ", "Valerie: Jamal, i never would have asked you this if i wasn't so scared. I mean, this is probably my only shot at getting the hartmans to change their minds about hope. If alison did anything to interfere, I would -- ", "jamal: Ok, ok, ok. Ok, I won't say anything. ", "Valerie: Thank you. ", "Jamal: For now. But as soon as we get this settled with the hartmans -- ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "valerie: Fine. Whatever. Let's just go see our little girl.

Lucy's not here, but i've been looking for you ever since you disappeared from the hospital. ", "Jack: I said where is she? I've got to find her. ", "Kevin: Jack, take it easy. Are you all right? ", "Jack: No, I'm not all right. Nobody is because caleb is back! ", "Kevin: Sounds like you've already been talking to lucy. ", "Jack: She knows, doesn't she? I knew lucy would know it. ", "Kevin: No, jack, she doesn't know anything. She has feelings, suspicions, which I got caught up in for a while until i realized that there wasn't one shred of proof anywhere. ", "Jack: No, no, no, there is proof. You're wrong. There is. ", "Kevin: No, there isn'T. There's only paranoia, which is going to be mass hysteria soon. ", "Jack: No, listen to me. Caleb is back and we have to put him away for good this time. Where's the slayer? I need the slayer. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: How did this happen, huh? I was supposed to be lucy's guardian angel. You tell me, how did things get so out of control? Because, god help me, this is the last thing i ever thought i'd have to do. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: I must've dozed off. ", "Caleb: Slaying a slayer can take a lot out of a person. ", "Livvie: Ah. I was hoping it wasn't just a dream. ", "Caleb: It was a dream. Only you made it come true. ", "Livvie: Oh. Come on, it wasn't so tough. I mean, sure, lucy did put up a fight, but i knew you were counting on me. She never had a chance. Can life possibly get any better? I mean, slayer woman's dead, the rest are circling the drain, and you -- my love, you've got your fangs back. ", "Caleb: There is one thing still missing. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "jack: Look, you better face the facts because if you don't, caleb's going to take us all out. ", "Kevin: That's just it, jack, there are no facts. No one has seen him. No one has any proof at all. ", "Jack: I don't need any proof because I know caleb is back. ", "Kevin: All right, jack. Then just tell me how do you know? ", "Jack: Because I went to the catacombs. And when i went there, i saw the music box. ", "Kevin: The music box? ", "Jack: Yes, the music box, and when i opened it, I saw evil -- caleb's evil. And that's when you saw me at g.H. That's why i was so messed up when you saw me at the hospital. ", "Kevin: Jack, listen to me. ", "Jack: No! You listen to me. Our blood-sucking friend is back! He's alive. I know he's alive. ", "Kevin: All right, jack. Jack? Just think about it. Think. If that were true, livvie would've heard from him. After all, caleb does consider her his wife. ", "Jack: No, no, no, no, no. She's not his wife. ", "Kevin: Regardless, we've contacted her and she told me that he hasn'T. ", "Jack: No, she told you what you wanted to hear. For some reason, she's protecting him.

", "Livvie: Now, what have i sacrificed? ", "Caleb: You left jack. ", "Livvie: I wanted to. ", "Caleb: And you helped break apart your friends, ian and eve, so that soon we'll have our child. ", "Livvie: Our son. ", "Caleb: Mm-hmm. You even turned on your own father. But when i think about last night, what you did last night, destroying one of our most powerful enemies -- ", "livvie: And did it with pleasure, my love. I would have done anything to bring you back to me fully, show you that nothing in this world matters except you. ", "Caleb: Olivia. ", "Livvie: And I know the one last thing you still want. I know and i want it, too. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "H0 8 ", "jamal: You know, val, I've been thinking. When we get to the hartmans', maybe you should let me do most of the talking. ", "Valerie: Oh, yeah? Why's that? ", "Jamal: Well, I just don't want to scare them off. You know? I mean, the way they were freaking on you and the way you were freaking on them and everything, we just -- ", "valerie: Ok, yeah, yeah, you're right. ", "Jamal: Yeah. ", "Valerie: Once they find out you're hope's daddy, it doesn't matter who tells them. They're going to flip out anyway, knowing what that means, that you have rights and -- ", "jamal: Look, I'm going to put their minds at ease right away, ok? I'm not there to take away their baby. Ok, I just want them to honor their original agreement and let you have some contact with the baby. That's it. ", "Valerie: Well, what about you? ", "Jamal: What about me? ", "Valerie: She's your daughter, jamal. Don't you want to know how she's getting along, what she's going to grow up to be like? Whether she'll take after you or me or your mama? Will you honestly be able to go in there and look in your little girl's eyes and then just walk away? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Hey, rafe. Hi. I didn't even see you sitting there. What's going on?", "Rafe: Hey, alison. How are you doing? What's up? ", "Alison: Well, actually, I sort of might be being a little bit paranoid and all, but I kind of feel like that maybe jamal's got something going on, and since you have such really good insight with everything, i sort of wanted to run it past you, although right now you don't look so hot. Are you ok? ", "Rafe: Did you ever feel like you're just a complete and utter failure? ", "Alison: Huh. Yeah. You having a low self-esteem day, huh? ", "Rafe: I'm serious. ", "Alison: I know. ", "Rafe: There's so many things in this world that are just so messed up. ", "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it. ", "Rafe: Really. I mean, really unfair. ", "Alison: Rafe, what's going on? ", "Rafe: You wouldn't believe me if i told you. ", "Alison: Oh, try me. ", "Rafe: Ok. ", "Rafe: I can't because that would be braking one of those oh-so-precious rules. ", "Alison: Oa -- what -- what rules? What are you talking about? ", "Rafe: Alison, you know what? You're a really good friend and I know you're just trying to help, but -- but you can'T. ", "Alison: What -- whoa. ", "Rafe: No one can. ", "Alison: Rafe? Wait, rafe, you forgot your journal -- from 1991. Why would you be carrying around a journal from 1991 that ends april 12? What's -- what's up with that? Well, I'm sure whatever it is it's very important and you need it. So -- hey, I'll be right back, ok?

Ok, she ordered me a drink and thank god I didn't drink it because it turns out she put poison in it. ", "Kevin: You saw livvie put poison in your drink? ", "Jack: Well, I didn't actually see her put -- ", "kevin: Well, then how do you know if you didn't drink it? Did you have it analyzed? ", "Jack: Look, I don't have time for any questions. I'm telling you the truth. She wanted me dead! ", "Kevin: Why? ", "Jack: Because obviously she's back with caleb. ", "Kevin: Ok. Ok. I think I see what this is about. You're hurting over your breakup. I can understand that. ", "Jack: No, no, no, no, no, no. You got to help me. You got to believe me. You don't, do you? Damn it. Ok, fine. Then i'll take care of this myself. ", "Kevin: All right, jack -- jack, wait. It's not that I don't believe you. But if we're going to deal with this, we have to do it calmly. Panic won't get us anywhere. ", "Jack: Right, right. I know that. ", "Kevin: All right, why don't you take a few minutes, put some water on your face, calm down, and then we'll talk about it. We'll figure out what to do. ", "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right. I just need to get control of my head.", "Kevin: In the meantime, I'll see if I can track down lucy. ", "Jack: Look, thanks, dr. Collins. Thanks for your help. ", "Kevin: This is dr. Kevin collins. I need an ambulance at my home right now. There's a young man here, delusional -- ", "jack: You said you believed me. You lied. ", "Kevin: Jack, you've been through a lot. And I think you need some help. ", "Jack: No, you're making a big mistake. You'll see. You'll all see. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: Caleb, what's wrong? ", "Caleb: We can't do this, not yet. ", "Livvie: Come on. After everything i've done. Don't you still want me? ", "Caleb: I want you so bad right now that i could take you and just get lost in you forever. ", "Livvie: Well, then, why? ", "Caleb: We got to stay strong. We can't afford to get vulnerable, not when we're so close. ", "Livvie: Ok. You said there's still one thing left to do. ", "Caleb: And there is -- one very important thing. ", "Livvie: Ok. Ok, just tell me what it is. I am yours to command. ", "Caleb: It's time, olivia. It's time for the grand finale. ", "Livvie: What do you have in mind? ", "Caleb: Oh. We're about to show everyone who tried to destroy us exactly who they're dealing with. We're going to show them the power of true eternal love. And when i'm done with them, they're going to wish they never walked this earth.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Valerie: You still haven't answered my question. ", "Jamal: What question? ", "Valerie: What are you going to do about hope? Do you want to be a part of her life? ", "Jamal: Valerie, come on. What do you want me to say? I mean, of course a part of me wants to be a part of her life. ", "Valerie: But the other part -- ", "jamal: Just knows i'd be complicating her life. I mean, the little girl doesn't even know me. ", "Valerie: Kids aren't complicated, jamal. You love them and they love you back. And frankly, i don't think it's possible to have too many people around to love them and want the best for them. ", "Jamal: All right, look, let's just go to the hartmans' and see how that goes first, ok? ", "Valerie: Sure. I mean, you don't have to decide this minute, right? ", "Jamal: Ok, but no matter what, I don't want to freak these people out. Ok? So i think we should give them a call and let them know we're coming first. ", "Valerie: No, no. I don't think that's a good idea at all. ", "Jamal: Look, val, i'm just trying to make this -- ", "valerie: I don't want to give them any warning. ", "Jamal: I'm just trying to make this as nonthreatening as possible -- if you want to have any hope of getting what you want. ", "Valerie: No pun intended? ", "Jamal: Yeah. ", "Valerie: All right, all right, have it your way. Let's go. ", "Jamal: All right. You got the number? ", "Valerie: Yeah. I got it right here. ", "Jamal: All right. ", "Valerie: Well, what happened? Did you get the machine? Why didn't you leave a message? ", "Jamal: Val, the number's been disconnected. ", "Valerie: Oh, my god. They're gone. They've taken off with our daughter, jamal. What are we going to do? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: You know, I've told you this before, but now i know it's really true -- your rules are a crock. You hear that? They're worthless. Poor little guy. At least i can fix you. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: How did you do that? Who are you, rafe? Who are you, really? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Lucy, it's kevin. Call me as soon as you get this. I need to talk to you right now. ", "Livvie: Hey, dad. What's going on? ", "Kevin: Livvie, jack was just here. And he was acting pretty crazy. ", "Livvie: Well, that's not too surprising. The last time I saw him, he accused me of trying to poison him. I think with all the stuff that's going on, he's really finally starting to crack. ", "Kevin: That's what I thought at first, but -- ", "[kevin sighs] ", "livvie: But what? ", "Kevin: I haven't been able to reach lucy. And we're not exactly close these days. But I can't seem to find her anywhere and that worries me. ", "Livvie: No, dad, lucy's fine. I just spoke to her. ", "Kevin: You did? ", "Livvie: Yeah. She went to the spa to unwind. I think with everything that's going on, she really needed a break. ", "Kevin: Of course, of course. That's what she'll do when the going gets tough. The tough get massaged. ", "Livvie: And she also said that when she gets done, she wants to see you. ", "Kevin: She say why? ", "Livvie: Something about getting together and settling things once and for all. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: Look, come out, you bastard! I know you're back, caleb. Why don't you be a man and show yourself? Quit hiding behind a woman and face me! ", "Caleb: Did you miss me? ", "Jack: How? How -- how did -- ", "caleb: You have to thank olivia. She's the one responsible. ", "Jack: No. ", "Caleb: Of course, being my wife, she responded to my call. ", "Jack: No, livvie didn't do that, you made her. ", "Caleb: I didn't make her do anything, jack. She brought me back of her own free will, just like she's done a lot of little things for me, like try to kill you. That's right, jack. She was so desperate to prove her love. And bless her little heart, that's what she decided to do. ", "Jack: She didn't prove it very well, did she? Because I'm still here. ", "Caleb: Oh, that's only because you had help from the other side. ", "Jack: What are you talking about? ", "Caleb: Hmm, that's for the big boys to know. You don't qualify. ", "Jack: Oh. You know, caleb, my one regret when i thought you were dead was that i wasn't going to be able to kill you myself. ", "Caleb: A great line. How long you been waiting to use that one? ", "Jack: It's over, caleb. The slayer's onto you. ", "Caleb: Ooh. The slayer. ", "Jack: Yeah, the slayer. Lucy. Remember her? This time, she's going to do away with you for good. ", "Caleb: Well, I hate to burst your bubble, little man, but lucy is dead. ", "Jack: No. No, I don't believe you. ", "Caleb: You have to trust me. I tasted her blood myself. ", "Jack: You son of a -- ", "caleb: Oh, well, you know, it's not like I spilled it, jack. That was olivia.", "Jack: Livvie? ", "Caleb: She insisted. ", "Jack: No. No, it can't be. ", "Caleb: Oh, how I -- how I do love this moment, jack -- that realization that you know you've lost. Don't you get it? I won, jack. I won. Not so fast, my friend. Just because the game's over doesn't mean we still can't have some fun. You see, olivia and I are throwing a little party and we just wouldn't want you to miss it.
