        "Livvie: Ok, Mr. Band manager. \r\nLet's see how long it takes to loosen those lips and get you talking about \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Joshua: You look ravishing. I'm \r\nso pleased you could join me. ",
        "Livvie: Yes, and I'm pleased to \r\nbe here. I have a feeling it's going to be a wonderful Thanksgiving. ",

        "Lucy: What do you think that \r\nwas, that noise? ",
        "Ian: It sounded like it came \r\nfrom upstairs. I'm going to check it out. ",
        "Lucy: Ok -- no, no. No, it's \r\nok. Don't bother. I'm sure it was just -- it was nothing. ",
        "Ian: Yeah?\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: You seem a little on edge. \r\nYou all right? ",
        "Lucy: No, no, I'm -- yeah. It's \r\na lighthouse I live in. It's creaky, and I hear strange noises all the time, and \r\nthat is not why I'm on edge. Before we heard that noise, you know, just a second \r\nago, and I was standing right here, and I think what we were about to do -- I \r\nmean, I was -- I think I was actually going to -- ",

        "Ian: Saved by the bell, right.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah, right. I'm going to \r\ngo get that bell -- or go to the door. Can't -- you know, we can't -- I -- no, \r\nthis -- ",

        "Alison: I didn't bake it \r\nmyself, though. I'm sorry. ",
        "Lucy: That's ok. I don't bake. \r\nI never bake a pie. Come on. I think people don't really do that in real life. \r\nThey don't. It's not -- no, no --\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Hi. ",
        "Lucy: Put it on the table. Hi \r\n-- no, come here. Stop. Wait -- don't -- don't -- don't go anywhere. Listen, we \r\nhave to agree to something. ",

        "Livvie: You've read my mind.\r\n",
        "Joshua: I think you will \r\nparticularly like this. It's a very rare vintage. ",

        "Joshua: Oh -- ",
        "Livvie: Oh oh, God, I'm so \r\nsorry. I -- I get a little nervous around new people. Could you get me a napkin, \r\nplease? ",

        "Ian: So, Elizabeth, you sure \r\nyou're ok? You look a little pale. ",
        "Elizabeth: I might still be a \r\nlittle tired, but I wouldn't have missed this for the world. It's the first \r\nThanksgiving that I get to spend with my daughter in -- much too long. \n",
        "Alison: You have no idea how \r\nhappy I am that you're here. Stephen, I'd like you to -- ",
        "Lucy: Ok, so much for our \r\nvampire-free Thanksgiving. What are we going to do? What do you -- what do you \r\nthink he is up to?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: I think he's just amusing \r\nhimself. And you know what? There's no reason we can't do the same. ",
