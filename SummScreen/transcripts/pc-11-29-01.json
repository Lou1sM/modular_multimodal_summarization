        "Caleb's Voice: I want that serum, and I want to see how Dr. Wexler's \r\nresponding. So I'd like to see you both tonight. You know, there's this new club \r\nin town called Tempted. I'd like you to be there. Or stay at home and start \r\npicking out the suit you want to be buried in. ",
        "Karen: This protein drink is disgusting. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but it's good for you. That's what counts. Put a little spring \r\nin that step. You look like you could use it. It's already got some color in \r\nyour cheeks. ",
        "Karen: It's makeup. I have the internal organs of an 85-year-old woman, and \r\nthis is supposed to make me feel better? ",
        "Chris: Yeah, but -- but you are getting better. I'm sure of it. ",
        "Karen: You know, you wouldn't be so confident if you knew how I felt. ",
        "Chris: Which is exactly why we're getting you out tonight. Come on. Let's put \r\nthis down. Hey, I'm taking care of this. Come on. I told you, I'm on top of it, \r\nI promise. ",
        "Karen: Ok. ",
        "Chris: Hey, one night out will do us both a world of good. There you go. Huh?\r\n",
        "Karen: Thanks. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I cannot believe that the Hartmans just took off with Hope. ",
        "Valerie: Because they didn't take a chance and wait like we did. You and \r\nAlison knew you were Hope's father, and you sat on it. Your girlfriend scared \r\nthem away. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we can still find them. Ok? Dara -- Dara works in the D.A.'s \r\noffice. Maybe she can help, all right? ",
        "Valerie: They could be anywhere, Jamal. I'm never going to see my baby again.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Val, come on. ",
        "Alison: Jamal -- Jamal, I'm so glad you're here. Listen, we need to be really \r\ncareful. What? What? What's the matter? ",
        "Jamal: The Hartmans -- the Hartmans skipped town with Hope. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. Well, I will do whatever it takes to help find them, ok? \r\nAnd we will, I promise. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, all right. ",
        "Alison: But there's something even scarier that we have to worry about. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Hey. I'm heading home to clean up, then I'm going over to that Tempted \r\nplace to hear what Karen has to say. You change your mind about coming? ",
        "Gabriela: No. ",
        "Frank: Ok. ",
        "Gabriela: Frank, don't go. ",
        "Frank: I have to go. You read that message. Karen wants to explain what's \r\ngoing on with her and Chris. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I -- I just have this feeling, you know? I got it when I saw \r\nLivvie at the hospital. ",
        "Frank: Livvie? What did she have to do with this? ",
        "Gabriela: I don't know. But I got the same feeling when Karen sent that \r\nmessage to both of us. ",
        "Frank: No, I think it was pretty straightforward. ",
        "Gabriela: No, not really. I mean, she didn't act like there was anything left \r\nto explain when we saw her with Chris. And why does she want me there? \r\nYou know, the whole thing is just very strange. ",
        "Frank: Strange is her hooking up with Ramsey to begin with. Look, I have to \r\nhear what she has to say, so I'm going either way. ",
        "Gabriela: All right. Fine. I don't want you to go by yourself. ",
        "Frank: Bad vibes and all? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. Really bad vibes. ",
        "",
        "Jack: No. No. I have to get out of here. I have to warn everybody about \r\nCaleb! Let me out of here! ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Wow. Dad, you look great. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, I'm not sure this is a good idea. ",
        "Livvie: Of course it is. Lucy went through a lot of trouble to set this up, \r\nand you always told me talking things out is good. ",
        "Kevin: Then why won't she return my calls? I can't find her anywhere. ",
        "Livvie: That's because she's at the spa. ",
        "Kevin: At the spa. You know, I called over there. They told me she hadn't \r\nbeen there in months. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that's because she decided to use a new one. Dad, don't worry \r\nso much. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I can't help it. Do you have the number? ",
        "Livvie: She had to have left by now to get ready for your dinner, which you \r\nshould be getting to. ",
        "Kevin: This just isn't like Lucy. I mean, no matter what is going on with us, \r\nshe always returns my calls. ",
        "Livvie: She probably just wants to talk to you in person. ",
        "Kevin: Well, what about Jack? ",
        "Livvie: What about him? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, he's disappeared, too. ",
        "Livvie: I'm sure he's fine. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm not. Livvie, he was in bad shape when he was here. ",
        "Livvie: Dad, I think you're worrying too much about everything. People aren't \r\nas predictable as you think. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, both Lucy and Jack have been talking about Caleb being back, \r\nand now we can't find either one of them. And you don't seem the least bit \r\nconcerned about it. Now, what is going on? ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ok. Ok, please, God -- please let Kevin have good news about Danny. ",
        "James: Good evening, madam. Welcome to Tempted. ",
        "Eve: Thank you. Hello. ",
        "James: Allow me to take your coat. ",
        "Eve: Oh, thanks. I never even knew this place existed. ",
        "James: Oh, yes. Tempted is a very special place. A once-in-a-lifetime \r\nexperience, if you don't mind my saying. ",
        "Eve: It sounds wonderful. ",
        "James: It will be. In fact, you're one of our first customers. ",
        "Eve: Oh, well -- ok. ",
        "James: Are you meeting someone? ",
        "Eve: Yes, I am -- Dr. Kevin Collins. ",
        "James: Well, Dr. Collins isn't here as yet, but I'm sure he won't keep such a \r\nbeautiful young woman waiting. Please. ",
        "James: Enjoy. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Alison, what are you talking about? What do you mean, scary? What do \r\nyou -- ",
        "Alison: I just have this feeling. I can't explain -- ",
        "Valerie: Great. We're trying to find our daughter, and you've got this bad \r\nfeeling? ",
        "Alison: Whoa, wait a second. \"Our daughter?\" ",
        "Valerie: Yeah, I know Jamal's Hope's father, no thanks to you. ",
        "Alison: Jamal -- ",
        "Bob: Hey, Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah? ",
        "Bob: I didn't see you come in. Someone left you a message. ",
        "Jamal: Thanks. All right. It's from the Hartmans. ",
        "Valerie: What does it say? ",
        "Jamal: They're back in town, and they want us to meet them at the new \r\nrestaurant called Tempted. ",
        "Valerie: When? ",
        "Jamal: Tonight. ",
        "Alison: No. You can't go. ",
        "",
        "Ian: What are you doing here? ",
        "Eve: I told you, I'm meeting a friend for dinner. ",
        "Ian: Right. ",
        "Eve: And this is your something special that you had to do? ",
        "Ian: The place wasn't my idea. ",
        "Eve: You're meeting Lucy, aren't you? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I am. What about you? ",
        "Eve: Kevin. ",
        "Ian: Right. Right. Well, I -- I'm not sure what Lucy wanted, but I'm sure I \r\ncan call her and tell her -- ",
        "Eve: What do you mean, you're not sure what Lucy wanted? ",
        "Ian: Livvie told me that I should meet Lucy here. ",
        "Eve: Livvie told me to meet Kevin here. I was wondering why he didn't just \r\ncall me himself. ",
        "Ian: I was wondering the same. ",
        "Eve: Ok. I know what's going on here. I know what Livvie's trying to do. \r\nShe's trying to get the four of us together. ",
        "Ian: And why would she do that? ",
        "Eve: Because she's a nice girl who's still young enough to believe in happily \r\never after. I got to go. I'm going to call Kevin, and then I'm going to go home.\r\n",
        "James: Good evening, madam. ",
        "Chris: Reservation under Dr. Ramsey. ",
        "James: Yes, of course. So good of you to join us. And the young lady? ",
        "Chris: Dr. Karen Wexler. ",
        "James: Splendid. I have a special table reserved for both of you. ",
        "Chris: Ian and Eve are right there. Ok? We have to look like a real couple, \r\nso help me out, would you? We don't want them to suspect anything. ",
        "Karen: You mean, like I'm dying? ",
        "Chris: Hey. ",
        "Karen: Hey. ",
        "Ian: What's going on here? ",
        "Eve: Karen, where have you been? I haven't seen you in ages, and I've left a \r\nlot of messages on your machine. ",
        "Chris: She's been busy. ",
        "Karen: I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you. He's right. I have been busy, \r\nand then I got the flu. ",
        "Eve: And Chris is taking care of you? ",
        "Chris: Of course I am. That's what you do when you're in love, right? ",
        "Eve: So I've heard. ",
        "Karen: You have? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, Frank told us after we stitched him up. ",
        "Karen: Stitched him up from what? ",
        "Ian: A bar fight. It seems he was upset about something. ",
        "Karen: Is he all right? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. He's going to be fine. But more importantly, how are you? ",
        "Karen: What do you mean? ",
        "Eve: Karen, it looks like you've got something more than just the flu. Are \r\nyou sure there isn't something else really wrong? ",
        "",
        "Jack: Let me out of here. Let me out of here! Ok. Ok. Ok. Just think. Just \r\nthink. Got to get my strength back up. No one knows about Caleb. No one knows \r\nthat Livvie's helping him. I'm the only one who can warn them. Ok. I just have \r\nto figure out how. Ok. Take it easy. Easy. ",
        "Jack: Come on. Easy. Go easy. ",
        "Jack: Ok. Ok. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I would be concerned about Lucy and Jack if I thought they were in \r\nany kind of trouble. But just because they haven't called you back or they're \r\nnot where they said they were going to be doesn't mean that anything horrible \r\nhas happened. ",
        "Kevin: And the fact that it's Jack and Lucy talking about Caleb being back \r\ndoesn't concern you at all? ",
        "Livvie: No, of course it does. I'm just trying really hard not to overreact \r\nthe way I did before because that's when everything goes wrong, Dad, for all of \r\nus. And I don't want that to happen again, Dad. All that stuff was in my head, \r\nand I know that now. And I'm finally getting my life back together. But now I've \r\nmade everyone else crazy. You know, it's my fault -- everything I did before \r\nCaleb died. I must be keeping him alive for people, just seeing me. ",
        "Kevin: No, no. No, Livvie. None of this is your fault. Look, what Jack and \r\nLucy are talking about has nothing to do with you. I overreacted, and I took it \r\nout on you. Look, you've been amazing. And I think we would all do better to \r\nfollow your lead. I'm sorry I questioned your feelings. ",
        "Livvie: I don't blame you. All I've brought into your life is problems. ",
        "Kevin: That couldn't be further from the truth. Livvie, you're the most \r\nincredible daughter that any father could ever ask for. You've been through more \r\nthan any person has a right to go through, and you've come out stronger in the \r\nend for it. I think the only thing I regret is not spending more time with you. \r\nThe one person in the world who means more than anything to me is right in front \r\nof me. Whatever Lucy wants to talk about, it can just wait. ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I'm going to stay here with you and Daniel. In fact, we'll make \r\na night of it. It'll just be the three of us. ",
        "Livvie: No, Dad, you have to go. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I didn't mean it like that, Dad. It's just you and Lucy mean so much \r\nto me, I don't want you to miss out on a chance to talk about things no matter \r\nwhat the outcome is. ",
        "Kevin: What Lucy and I have to work out is going to take more than one talk.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Please, Dad? Please? It sounded really important to Lucy, and it \r\nsounds like you'd feel much better. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I don't want to leave you alone right now. ",
        "Livvie: I know how much you love me, and that means everything to me. And I \r\nlove you, too. That's why I want you to go and work out your problems. Or at \r\nleast try. Come on, Dad. I want you to be happy. ",
        "Kevin: You already make me happy. Come here. And I only worry about you \r\nbecause that's what fathers do. ",
        "Livvie: And I worry about you, too, because that's what daughters do. So, go. \r\nGo. Hurry. I'll be fine. Danny and I will be fine. ",
        "Kevin: I love you. ",
        "Livvie: I love you, too. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",

        "",
        "Jamal: Alison, what has gotten into you? Look, why shouldn't we go? ",
        "Alison: It doesn't make any sense, for one thing. Ok? I mean, the Hartmans -- \r\nthey leave town to get Hope away from you, and then the next minute, they want \r\nto meet you? That doesn't make any sense. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we have to hear what they have to say. I don't see how it could \r\nhurt. ",
        "Alison: Jamal, please. I just have a really bad feeling about this, about \r\ntonight -- ",
        "Valerie: Please. ",
        "Alison: Look, do you believe that each person has their own guardian angel? \r\nYou know? And maybe that they come down to try and protect you when something \r\nreally bad is about to happen? ",
        "Jamal: Like, Bible angel? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on. What are you talking about, baby? ",
        "Alison: Nothing. It's just that -- ",
        "Valerie: We got to go, or we're going to be late. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we'll talk later, ok? ",
        "Alison: No. Later might be too late. Come on. ",
        "Jamal: Ali, come on. ",
        "Alison: Ok, then I'll go with you. I will. It's fine. ",

        "Jamal: You -- you can't. Please, just -- just stay out of this. Ali, come on.\r\n",
        "Alison: Ooh. Jamal. I wish that I could tell you that Rafe was an angel, but \r\n-- that's how I know that something bad's going to happen. I need to make sure \r\nthat you're ok. ",

        "Jack: Tempted? ",

        "Chris: I've already done that. Ok? And we're doctors, remember? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Thanks. Karen, are you sure you're ok -- ",
        "Karen: I'm sure. I'm sure. We're not staying that long. In fact, maybe we \r\nshould just head back. ",
