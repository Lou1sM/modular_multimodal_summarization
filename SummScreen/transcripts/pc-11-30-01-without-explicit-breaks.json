        "James: Your opening night, master. Are you nervous? ",
        "Caleb: Strange. I'm hours away from getting all my power back. ",
        "James: Enjoy this evening. Watch your enemies fall one by one. In all my \r\nyears, i have never seen such skill, determination, and courage. ",
        "Caleb: Thank you, james. Thank you. ",
        "James: It's been an honor playing my small part, master caleb. I regret only \r\nthat i cannot serve you through eternity. But from this night on, fear nothing. \r\nYour skills are at their peak, and your resourceful young bride is at your side.\r\n",
        "Caleb: You're willing to admit that now. ",
        "James: I misjudged. I leave you, happily, well-matched and well-guarded. ",
        "Caleb: Alas, thank you, james -- for your service to my family and your \r\nfriendship to me. ",
        "James: Knowing I've done my job well in your eyes is the reward i take with \r\nme to the darkness. ",
        "James: Good fortune, master. May rivers of blood spill over the centuries for \r\nyou and your lovely bride till the sun burns cold. ",
        "Caleb: Sleep well, james, now and forever. You've earned it, as i have earned \r\ntonight. Very soon my guests will know exactly what i have in store for them.\r\n",
        "Alison: What are you doing here? ",
        "Rafe: Me? I just heard about this new restaurant -- ",
        "alison: Rafe, don't lie. You said that there was something that was going to \r\nhappen tonight. ",
        "Rafe: I did? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. When is it going to happen? Here? Whatever you said it was is \r\ngoing to happen here? Is there some sort of danger? ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "alison: Tell me, please! Jamal is in there, and i need to find a way in \r\nthere. ",
        "Rafe: There's nothing I can say! All right? Tonight of all nights, things \r\njust got to work out on their own. That's the rules. ",
        "Alison: But you're an angel! ",
        "Rafe: Shh. ",
        "Alison: Look, you cannot stand back and do nothing. ",
        "Rafe: I don't have a choice. ",
        "Alison: Why? ",
        "Rafe: Because I'm -- look, I just got to have faith, all right? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, ok. You do that. And I'm not an angel, so i need to get in \r\nhere. Find a way in here -- I'm sorry -- ",
        "rafe: No, alison -- ",
        "alison: Please don't. ",
        "Rafe: No -- ",
        "alison: I need to find a way in. My friends are in there. Rafe, stop it! \r\nRafe, put me down right now! ",
        "Ian: What are you saying? ",
        "Eve: It can't be. ",
        "Jack: You got to believe me. There's no time to argue. ",
        "Kevin: Listen to him. ",
        "Jack: Caleb's back, and he brought us all here to get his revenge. ",
        "Valerie: What revenge? What's he talking about? ",
        "Gabriela: No, it can't be. If caleb were here, I would feel it. ",
        "Ian: Caleb's gone. ",
        "Kevin: No! That was caleb's manservant. Lucy and i saw him die in \r\ntransylvania. ",
        "Jack: You all saw him disappear. ",
        "Kevin: Why didn't i listen to her? Lucy's been saying all along that caleb \r\nwas behind this! ",
        "Ian: If that monster's back, there's no time for blame now! ",
        "Eve: Oh, my god, ian. Kevin, where's danny? Where is he right now? ",
        "Kevin: He's at the lighthouse. He's fine. Livvie is taking care of him. ",
        "Eve: I have to go there. ",
        "Jack: Kevin -- ",
        "frank: You're too late! ",
        "Kevin: Not now. Not now, jack! ",
        "Gabriela: Come on! ",
        "Eve: Try again! Try -- ",
        "kevin: Eve, calm down! Daniel is fine. He's with livvie -- ",
        "jack: No, no, he's not fine! Livvie is working with caleb. ",
        "Ian: Livvie's what? ",
        "Jack: No one's safe, especially the baby. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my god. ",
        "Ian: What are you talking about? ",
        "Jack: Listen to me. Livvie brought caleb back. She's helped cause all of \r\nthis. ",
        "Kevin: No, no -- no, that can't be! ",
        "Jack: Kevin, it's true. ",
        "Eve: Ian, what are we going to do? ",
        "Jack: I know you guys don't want to believe this. Neither did I. But they're \r\na team, and they've been working together all along. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy would've known that. She would've sensed if livvie were helping \r\ncaleb. ",
        "Jack: She did know. She tried to stop this. ",
        "Kevin: Jack, where's lucy right now? Jack? ",
        "Jack: Lucy's dead. ",
        "Kevin: No. No, that's impossible. ",
        "Jack: Livvie murdered her in cold blood. And we're all next. ",
        "Livvie: Time to go, danny. Guess where I'm taking you. You're going to see \r\nyour daddy. That's right. Time to go see daddy. ",
        "Kevin: I love you. ",
        "Livvie: Time to see your new daddy. ",
        "Kevin: This can't be. ",
        "Jack: No, it is, kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie couldn'T. Livvie -- ",
        "chris: Who cares what livvie did? Lucy's dead -- tragic. Can we please focus? \r\nI want to get out of here! ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "frank: Work out a little frustration first! ",
        "Gabriela: Frank! Frank! ",
        "Jack: Frank is right! Let's get out of here, and then we -- ",
        "[noise] ",
        "eve: What -- what was that? ",
        "Kevin: Look out! ",
        "[Screams] ",
        "eve: We're trapped. ",
        "Jack: Caleb! ",
        "ian: Everyone all right? ",
        "Chris: For now. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: What now? ",
        "Frank: We stay calm and work together. ",
        "Kevin: Right. ",
        "Ian: Let's get this wall moving. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, let's get this moved. ",
        "Frank: There's nothing to grab on to. ",
        "Chris: There's got to be some kind of weak spot. ",
        "Eve: He's really going to do it, ian. He's going to take our son, and he's \r\ngoing to kill us all. ",
        "Ian: No, he won't. We're getting out of here, and we're getting our son back.\r\n",
        "Frank: I don't know about anyone else, but i'm not going to give him the \r\nsatisfaction. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, caleb thinks we're going to go down without a fight. ",
        "Jamal: Right. To hell with that. ",
        "Valerie: I don't even know what a caleb is. ",
        "Chris: Would you give it a rest? He's not even after you. ",
        "Frank: Well, then, who's he after, ramsey? ",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. You knew. That's why you were in such a hurry to get \r\nout. ",
        "Karen: So i didn't imagine it. Caleb was at your apartment. ",
        "Ian: At your apartment? ",
        "Frank: I ought to ring your scrawny, little neck, ramsey! ",
        "Ian: Easy, easy -- ",
        "chris: Understand -- ",
        "jamal: What's that? What was that? ",
        "Kevin: Look out, look out. ",
        "Valerie: What's happening? ",
        "Frank: The wall's moving. ",
        "Jack: We got to stop it! ",
        "[Screaming] ",
        "alison: I said put me down! ",
        "Rafe: All right, all right! ",
        "Alison: I'm serious! Right this second! God! ",
        "Rafe: Come on, just -- you have to listen to me for a second, please. ",
        "Alison: Ok! All right! Fine, ok, but I got to get back. So hurry up with \r\nwhatever you got to say. ",
        "Rafe: I know, I know. You're worried about jamal. You're worried about \r\neveryone in there. But I couldn't let you go in that restaurant. ",
        "Alison: Why? Why not? ",
        "Rafe: Because I didn't want you to see it. I didn't want you to have any part \r\nof -- ",
        "alison: What? What are you talking about? Please, just tell me. Look, I'm not \r\nafraid of, like, whatever is going to happen to me, you know? ",
        "Rafe: Jamal wouldn't have wanted you in there, either. Trust me, alison. He \r\nhas all the help he needs. If everyone in there bands together, they -- they can \r\nfight this evil and they can win. ",
        "Alison: What evil? What are you talking about? And, sorry, but what good is \r\nan angel if you won't even lift a heavenly finger? ",
        "Rafe: I ask myself the same question. ",
        "Alison: Yeah? What sort of answer do you give your angelic self? ",
        "Rafe: That i would give anything just to be normal, to not have to face this \r\nkind of thing day after day every day. But I'm not just a man, and I can't \r\ninterfere. ",
        "Alison: Why not? ",
        "Rafe: Believe me, it's not because I don't want to. See, that -- that's half \r\nmy problem. I'd risk anything, but i just -- ",
        "alison: But -- but what? ",
        "Rafe: It's their lives. It's their choices. And I can't change their \r\ndestinies. ",
        "Alison: Um -- ok. So you're just going to, like, stand there and do nothing?\r\n",
        "Rafe: I have done all I can for these people. I've shown everyone in there \r\ndirection. I've -- I've pointed them where to look deep in their souls for the \r\nanswers they're looking for. All that's left to do now is to have faith, and i \r\ndo. I -- I have faith in your friends. ",
        "Alison: No, wait. They're -- they're our friends. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, our friends! Fine! Our friends. See, even at odds with each \r\nother, i believe that they're going to come together. And I'm just not permitted \r\nto alter the course of their lives. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Oh, no? So, then, what am I doing here? I wanted to be with them, \r\nwith jamal and everybody else, ok? That -- that's what i chose. But you stopped \r\nme and you interfered. Ok, why did you take me away from that restaurant, rafe? \r\nWhy? Why me? ",
        "Ian: Harder! ",
        "Gabriela: Push! ",
        "Jamal: What do we do? ",
        "Kevin: Grab a chair! ",
        "Chris: A what? ",
        "Kevin: A piece! Anything sharp enough to jam underneath! ",
        "Eve: Hurry! ",
        "Frank: Stick it underneath! Stick it under! ",
        "Chris: There's no traction! ",
        "Gabriela: It's still coming! ",
        "Ian: Chris, frank, give me a hand here! ",
        "Chris: What, another brilliant plan? ",
        "Gabriela: The tables! The tables! ",
        "Kevin: We got it! Let's go! ",
        "Gabriela: You guys! ",
        "Ian: I hope it works. ",
        "Chris: This is great! Bar tables against the forces of evil! I love it! ",
        "Gabriela: Shut up! ",
        "Jack: Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Do you hear that? ",
        "Gabriela: It's stopping! We did it! ",
        "Valerie: Thank god! Jamal -- ",
        "jamal: Shh. Shh. ",
        "Ian: It worked. ",
        "Jack: Caleb -- you bastard! ",
        "[Rumbling] ",
        "[screams] ",
        "kevin: Caleb. ",
        "Alison: You know, rafe, you keep on telling me about all of these stupid \r\nrules you can't break and how we all make our own decisions and you can't \r\ninterfere. ",
        "Rafe: It's all true. ",
        "Alison: See, i chose to be with them, ok, and you just picked me up and you \r\ncarried me out of there. ",
        "Rafe: I blew it. I was wrong to do what i did the way I did it. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so why did you? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I -- i lost it. Ok? I guess I overreacted. I mean, I saw \r\nyou going into that restaurant, and I just -- all I could think about was \r\nkeeping you safe. I -- ",
        "alison: You just wanted to protect me. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Come here. You're a good friend. You are, ok? And it means -- \r\nmeans a lot. But we both know that I don't really belong here. You know what? I \r\nhave to go back with jamal and all of them. ",
        "Rafe: Great. ",
        "Alison: So -- ",
        "rafe: But I -- i can't let you go alone because i'd never forgive myself if \r\nanything happened, and I -- ",
        "alison: Ok, all right. Then just come with me. Ok, you want to come with me, \r\nthen? ",
        "Rafe: Whether you like it or not. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, I like. Come on. Hey, hey -- come on. If you're going to \r\ncome with me, there's no time to waste. We got to go, ok? Come on. ",
        "Rafe: Right, i'm -- I'm right -- right behind you. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Come on. ",
        "Caleb: Evening, boys and girls. Ok. By show of hands, who missed me? ",
        "Ian: You son of a -- ",
        "eve: No, ian, ian -- ",
        "caleb: Nice to see you, too, doctor. And you, doctor. Doctor. All you \r\nsemi-doctors, friends of doctors, lovers of doctors, and -- well, just all the \r\nlittle people. I want to thank you all for coming. I know how pressed you all \r\nwere for time. But perhaps we could just take one moment to truly appreciate the \r\nirony of actual walls closing in on you, just like they've been doing for the \r\nlast months without any of you knowing. And also for my flashy entrance. Feel \r\nfree to applaud. ",
        "Kevin: While we still can, you mean. ",
        "Caleb: Relax and take comfort in knowing you won't die alone. And, really, \r\nthat's what this has all been about -- people coming together and no one missing \r\nthe really big show. ",
        "Kevin: Well, then, disappear now. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, but then i'd miss the look on your faces when i tell you how i \r\nused your own pathetic human love against you. ",
        "Jack: The only one who's pathetic here is you, caleb! ",
        "Caleb: It was so easy tearing you all apart -- of course, with help from my \r\nwife. ",
        "Kevin: That's a lie. ",
        "Caleb: Olivia was my partner in -- in so many ways. Like bringing valerie to \r\ntown to separate you from the toothy blonde. ",
        "Jamal: You lousy, gutless coward. ",
        "Caleb: Hmm, thank you. And, of course, delivering the letter to you that \r\nwhipped up all your suspicions about guess who. But I guess I'll never really, \r\nreally forget her award-winning performance as -- you're looking at me like you \r\ndon't know what i'm talking about. Well -- well, then, why don't we go to a \r\nclip? You know what they say about pictures. ",
        "Eve: Anne-marie -- ",
        "kevin: Was livvie. ",
        "Caleb: And that's not all. ",
        "Kevin: Christina. ",
        "Caleb: Now for the big bonus points -- ",
        "kevin: Was livvie. That's why lucy was the only one who saw her. ",
        "Caleb: Wasn't she brilliant? But nothing really compares to her greatest \r\nperformance of all. A truly drop-dead -- in fact, that's exactly what your \r\nfiancee did when she saw it. Or is it your fiancee? You people have me so \r\nconfused. ",
        "Kevin: No! ",
        "Caleb: I want you to know, dad, your daughter's a very resourceful young \r\nwoman. ",
        "Kevin: No, you -- you brainwashed her. Livvie would never harm anyone on her \r\nown. ",
        "[Caleb imitates buzzer] ",
        "caleb: Guess again. ",
        "Kevin: All right, then, where is she? I don't see her here at your sick \r\nlittle circus! She wouldn't come, would she? She refused to have anything to do \r\nwith it! ",
        "[Caleb imitates buzzer] ",
        "caleb: Wrong again! You want her? You got her. So let's give a really nice, \r\nwarm, port charles welcome for -- ",
        "ian and eve: Danny -- ",
        "kevin: Livvie -- ",
        "eve: Danny! Oh, my gian, he's got danny. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, what are you doing? ",
        "Eve: Danny -- ",
        "kevin: Livvie -- ",
        "livvie: I'm where I belong, dad. ",
        "Eve: It's ok. Mommy's here, mommy's here. ",
        "Jack: How could you do this? ",
        "Eve: Danny. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie -- ",
        "ian: Easy. ",
        "Caleb: Come to papa, junior. ",
        "Livvie: I'm so sorry -- ",
        "eve: No! ",
        "Ian: It's ok -- ",
        "eve: No! ",
        "Livvie: But he's not your son anymore. ",
        "Eve: Oh, danny! Mommy's here. ",
        "Alison: Jamal? Jamal! Jamal! ",
        "Rafe: Alison, wait! Just wait a second, all right? ",
        "Alison: What? We've waited long enough, rafe. Our friends are in there! \r\nJamal! ",
        "Rafe: They're in there with a dark and powerful force. You got to be careful.\r\n",
        "Alison: Fine. I will be careful. Jamal! ",
        "Rafe: Listen, listen. Now, i will do what I can, but I just -- ",
        "alison: Ok, I know. Rafe, listen to me. I know your wings -- they're tied, \r\nok? Look, I appreciate what you're doing. I really, really do. But whatever is \r\ngoing on in there, i'm ready. Ok, I can take it. I promise you. Now, please, \r\njust help me find a way in before it's too late. Jamal! Please! Jamal! ",
        "Rafe: It's already too late. ",
        "Alison: What? What? ",
        "Rafe: It's already started. There's nothing we can do. ",
        "Eve: No! No! Please, you can't do this! ",
        "Ian: Give us back our son! ",
        "Eve: Oh, god -- ",
        "caleb: I know this sounds kind of silly, but i think he's got my eyes. ",
        "Ian: Livvie -- ",
        "eve: Livvie -- ",
        "ian: Livvie, please -- ",
        "eve: Please, help us, livvie! ",
        "Kevin: Livvie -- livvie, you can't do this. ",
        "Jack: This isn't you. ",
        "Livvie: Wrong! For the first time, I am making all my own decisions. This is \r\nmy choice. ",
        "Eve: No! ",
        "Kevin: Only because he wants you to believe that, just like before. ",
        "Livvie: No, not this time, dad. I pledged my life to him willingly. ",
        "Caleb: And baby makes three. ",
        "Livvie: It's the way it's supposed to be. Now we're a real family. ",
        "Eve: No! ",
        "Kevin: This can't be happening. ",
        "Caleb: Not only is it happening, it's about to get better. You see, right \r\nbefore your eyes, as our grand finale, you're about to see proof of eternal \r\ndevotion, proof that olivia has given herself to me, heart and soul, proof by \r\nthe look in her eyes of eternal bliss as i make love to my beautiful wife. ",
        "No ",
        "kevin: You're sick. ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Eve: Danny, it's ok, honey. ",
        "Kevin:Vvie -- livvie, listen to me. Livvie! ",
        "Caleb: Everything i've ever wanted. The dream that i have been dreaming for \r\ncenturies. ",
        "Jack: Livvie, no, don't do this! ",
        "Kevin: Livvie! ",
        "Caleb: Here it is. I have my family. And seeing us bursting with happiness, \r\nflush with the joy of victory, is the last thing you'll ever see before you die \r\n-- all of you. ",
        "Livvie: My love. ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- livvie, don't do this. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie -- livvie -- livvie? Livvie! ",
        "Caleb: Olivia. Sweet olivia. ",
        "Livvie: I just -- I want it to be perfect. ",
        "Caleb: It is perfect. You look so beautiful. ",
        "Livvie: Lose yourself in me. Let me lose myself. ",
        "Caleb: Finally mine, forever, through lifetimes of darkness. ",
        "Livvie: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: Entwined in a whirlwind of lust. ",
        "Livvie: More. Open your heart. Tell me. Please whisper. ",
        "Caleb: Olivia, I love you. ",
        "Livvie: Again. ",
