All you semi-doctors, friends of doctors, lovers of doctors, and -- well, just all the little people. I want to thank you all for coming. I know how pressed you all were for time. But perhaps we could just take one moment to truly appreciate the irony of actual walls closing in on you, just like they've been doing for the last months without any of you knowing. And also for my flashy entrance. Feel free to applaud. ", "Kevin: While we still can, you mean. ", "Caleb: Relax and take comfort in knowing you won't die alone. And, really, that's what this has all been about -- people coming together and no one missing the really big show. ", "Kevin: Well, then, disappear now.

But nothing really compares to her greatest performance of all. A truly drop-dead -- in fact, that's exactly what your fiancee did when she saw it. Or is it your fiancee? You people have me so confused. ", "Kevin: No! ", "Caleb: I want you to know, dad, your daughter's a very resourceful young woman. ", "Kevin: No, you -- you brainwashed her.
