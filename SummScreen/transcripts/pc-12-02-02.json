        "Christina: Will daddy kiss me \r\ngood night, too? ",
        "Lucy: Uh -- well, no, I don't \r\nthink tonight. You know, he is away, still. ",
        "Christina: But he kissed me \r\ngood night last night. ",
        "Lucy: Well, pumpkin, no, I \r\ndon't think he did because he's not here. ",
        "Christina: But he was here, \r\nmommy. I saw him. I promise. He kissed me good night. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, ok. Ok, I believe \r\nyou. But you know what I think this is about? I think this is you missing him, \r\nbecause I miss him so much, too. And sometimes when you miss somebody a lot, you \r\ndream about them, and maybe that's what this was -- just some happy dream.\r\n",
        "Christina: But it wasn't a \r\ndream.\r\n\n",

        "Ian: Why don't we go upstairs, \r\nand you can show me where you saw your daddy, ok? ",
        "Christina: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Good idea. You don't \r\nreally think -- do you? ",
        "Ian: No, I don't. But she does.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. Well, just -- I'll be \r\nwaiting down here, I guess, right? Right? ",
        "Christina: I'll show you \r\ndaddy's here. Then you'll believe me. ",
        "Lucy: Right. You know, I don't \r\nknow what I'd do without you, and -- I just keep saying that, don't I? \n",
        "Ian: It'll all be fine. \n",

        "Alison: Excuse me? ",
        "Caroline: Well, I just thought \r\nit would be more comfortable if we all got to know each other first. I assumed \r\nyou might want to know about my relationship with Malcolm, your father? \r\nShannon's father. ",
        "Alison: Shannon? My sister's \r\nname is Shannon?\r\n\n",
        "Caroline: Yes -- oh, I'm sorry. \r\nI brought a photo for you. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. She looks a \r\nlot like me. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, she's very pretty.\r\n",
        "Alison: Um -- does she know \r\nabout me? ",
        "Caroline: Oh, she's really \r\nlooking forward to meeting you. ",
        "Rafe: If you don't mind my \r\nasking, how'd you hear about this? ",
        "Caroline: Elizabeth -- \r\nMalcolm's wife -- she located me through some mutual friends in Toronto. Is your \r\nmother going to be here tonight? ",

        "Ian: We looked everywhere, and \r\nthere was no sign of Kevin. Isn't that right? ",
        "Christina: No, daddy's gone \r\nagain. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Ok, well, you know, I \r\nwas just kind of worried because you guys were up there a very long time. \n",
        "Ian: Well, we looked all around \r\nthe upstairs and then we had a little chat, didn't we? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, really? You had a \r\nlittle chat, huh? What was your chat about? ",
        "Ian: We were just talking, you \r\nknow, and I told her that sometimes when I want something badly enough, I dream \r\nof it being real. And then when I wake up in the morning, it feels like it \r\nreally happened. ",
        "Christina: Is that what \r\nhappened to me, mommy?\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, you know what, \r\nsweet pea? I think that is exactly -- exactly what happened to you. And you know \r\nwhat else? Sometimes when you want something so badly, you can make all those \r\ndreams come true. You can. ",
        "Ian: And sometimes mommies and \r\ndaddies -- they have to go away for a while, you know? But there's this secret, \r\nmagical place where you can be with them. But you're such a smart cookie, you \r\nalready knew about that, didn't you? ",
        "Christina: No. ",
        "Ian: Yes, you did. Because you \r\nknow how to get under your covers and close your eyes, and then you can see your \r\ndad. ",
        "Christina: I love you, Ian.\r\n",
        "Ian: I love you.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Hey, you know what? You \r\nshould be tuckered out by now. I think it's time to go upstairs and go to bed. \r\nCome on, come on, come on. Come on, I'll be right upstairs to tuck you in, ok? \r\nShe does love you a lot, you know. ",
        "Ian: Yeah? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: What about her mother?\r\n",
        "Lucy: I'm overwhelmed. Do you \r\n-- do you want to have that talk? You know, that I was talking about earlier? Do \r\nyou want to have that talk now? ",
        "Ian: I got to pull an \r\nall-nighter at the hospital. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Ok, then. Then we're \r\non for breakfast and we can talk then.\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Let me ask you -- \n",

        "Rafe: Ok, listen to me. I know \r\nhow much you want this to be true, but let's just make sure it is, ok? \n",
        "Alison: Ok. Well, I'm going to \r\ngo call my mother and see what's taking her so long because she should really be \r\nhere by now. Ok? ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Caroline: If you have any \r\nquestions -- ",
        "Rafe: Oh, no. No. You're very \r\ngood at answering questions. But just so you know, I'm here for Alison, and the \r\nthing is that she's had a very tough time lately. As you know, her father died, \r\nand she barely knew him to begin with, and -- and, well, it turns out all the \r\nfamily money's gone.\r\n\n",
        "Caroline: My husband and I are \r\nvery comfortable. I'm here for my daughter. Alison's part of her family. That's \r\nwhy I'm here, Mr. Kovich. ",
        "Alison: I got her voicemail \r\nagain. Do you think maybe we could get Shannon on the phone? Or do you think \r\nit's too late in the evening to do that? ",
        "Elizabeth: What are you doing \r\nhere? ",
        "Alison: Mother -- hi. I'm \r\nreally glad that you're here. This is the woman from Canada that we were on our \r\nway to see. This is the mother of my sister. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, Alison, it's \r\nnot. I told you not to come here. ",
        "Caroline: I'm sure it's very \r\ndifficult for your mother to face your father's mistress. Perhaps I should come \r\nback some other time.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: What's going on here?\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, that girl in \r\nthat picture -- that is not your sister. This woman is a fake. This whole thing \r\nis a lie. ",

        "Stephen: It's all right. Just \r\n-- just calm down, ok? ",

        "Stephen: Fangs? Joshua, do I \r\nhave fangs? ",
        "Joshua: Not that I'm aware of.\r\n",
        "Stephen: And if I did, where \r\nare they now? ",
        "Livvie: No, I know what I saw.\r\n",
        "Stephen: And when was that, \r\nLivvie? You -- you seemed pretty distracted when I arrived. I don't know you \r\nthat well, but Joshua here is usually a little more discreet. ",
        "Joshua: It was probably \r\nalcohol. I shouldn't drink.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: I am not drunk and I am \r\nnot on drugs, and you know that, Caleb. ",
        "Stephen: \"Caleb\" again. I guess \r\nin your eyes, I'll always be him. Look, I'm sorry to break up this beautiful \r\nevening, but I do need to talk to Joshua. It's very important. ",

        "Ian: Karen's out of town. She's \r\nvisiting her mother. How's Christina doing? ",
        "Lucy: She fell asleep the \r\nminute her head hit the pillow. Thank you. You really helped out a lot. \n",

        "Lucy: What am I doing? I'm \r\nleading Ian on, makinghim actually think we have a chance, that we could \r\nactually be together. It's not going to happen, is it? It's not, because I love \r\nmy husband. And no matter what Kevin and I have had happen to us, we've always \r\ncome through, and Ian just deserves so much better. Ok, so, that's what I'll \r\ntell him tomorrow. I'll just tell him flat out that's what it is. I cannot \r\npossibly feel like this. I cannot possibly be in love with two men. I can't. I \r\nwon't. I just -- I just won't. I won't, won't. I won't.\r\n\n",

        "Rafe: Ok, let's get out of \r\nhere. ",
        "Alison: No, wait, wait, wait, \r\nwait. I have to know one thing from you. When we were outside at that crash \r\nsite, when we shared that moment -- was that a lie, too? ",
