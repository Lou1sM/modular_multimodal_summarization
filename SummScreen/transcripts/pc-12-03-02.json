        "Kevin: I suppose you're still \r\nwondering why I'm not at the hospital. ",
        "Lucy: I'm wondering a lot of \r\nthings. I'm wondering a lot of things, Doc. I mean Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: No, lucy, it's all \r\nright. You can call me \"Doc.\" ",
        "Lucy: You -- you told me you \r\ndidn't like that before. ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know, but I \r\nsaid and did a lot of things before. They're all pretty horrifying, but I -- \r\nI've changed, Lucy, and I even have the release papers to prove it.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: You -- you -- you have \r\nrelease papers? ",
        "Kevin: Well, don't think I \r\nforgot what you told me -- don't show up on the doorstep unless you're serious \r\nabout your recovery. So I've been working very hard with Dr. Fox. And he feels \r\nthat I've made a lot of progress, so much so that he actually wants me to \r\ncontinue my treatment as an outpatient. ",
        "Lucy: I see. So Dr. Fox said \r\nthat? He told you that? ",
        "Kevin: I am really so much \r\nbetter. ",
        "Lucy: Well, then what are you \r\ndoing here like this? What were you doing? Were you spying on me, sneaking \r\naround? You were spying on me? ",
        "Kevin: No.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, why didn't you \r\ncall? Why didn't you just pick up the phone and warn me you were coming --\r\n",
        "kevin: I tried more than once, \r\nLucy, but I couldn't just leave a message. By the time I got here, it was late. \r\nEveryone was asleep. ",
        "Lucy: So you just watched us?\r\n",
        "Kevin: I looked in on my \r\nfamily. And seeing everyone safe in their beds gave me a peace that I haven't \r\nfelt in a long time. So I kissed Christina good night and I went up to the \r\nstudio and I guess I just fell asleep. By the time I woke up the next day, you \r\nalready had a house full of guests and tofu turkey on the table, and everything \r\nwas just so wonderfully you, I didn't think it would be healthy for anybody if I \r\ncrashed the party.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Oh, I see, so this way is \r\nso much better? ",

        "Kevin: Look, Lucy, if you want \r\nme to go, just say the word. I'm not going to do anything that makes you feel \r\nuncomfortable. But I do have to ask you one question. Do you still love me?",
