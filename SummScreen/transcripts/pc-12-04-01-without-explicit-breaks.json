        "eve: What could be more perfect than you marrying us right here? The only \r\nthing you have to do is say yes. ",
        "Chris: The sedative's harmless. ",
        "Jack: If it's so harmless, then you take it. ",
        "Chris: Ah! ",
        "Alison: There it is again. ",
        "Livvie: Shh! ",
        "rafe's voice: \"Ok, evil is gone, but the damage it's done remains. He made \r\nthem all doubt their love. Making them trust it again is not going to be easy. \r\nAnd doing it by christmas eve --\" ",
        "rafe: That's definitely going to take a miracle. ",
        "[Daniel cries] ",
        "eve: Why are you so sad? Huh? What do you want? Do you want your bear? No? Do \r\nyou want your lovey? Huh? Do you want your lovey? Oh, goodness. What is it? Huh? \r\nYou're so unhappy these days. ",
        "Ian's voice: \"High is the mountain red is the rose, deep blue is the water \r\nwhere young daniel goes. And down falls the river past the house on the sand, \r\nwith daniel's ship flying just as fast as it can.\" ",
        "Eve: I know what you want. Yes, i do, buddy. I know exactly what's going to \r\nmake you feel better! I know what you've been missing this whole time. Oops. \r\nWhere'd you go? Peekaboo. I know what you've been missing. Let's go, ok? Yeah, \r\nwe're on our way. Yes, we are. Oh. Kevin, hi. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, hey. Where -- where you going? ",
        "Eve: Oh. There's just someplace -- something that we need to do. I can't \r\nexplain it. ",
        "Kevin: But you can't leave the house with daniel. ",
        "Eve: No, it'll be ok. ",
        "Kevin: Eve, if social services finds out -- ",
        "eve: They won't. ",
        "Kevin: What makes you so sure? ",
        "Eve: I can't explain it. I just -- I just know that everything's going to be \r\nok. Come on. ",
        "Kevin: Eve -- ",
        "[knock on door] ",
        "kevin: Oh, thank god, you came to your senses. Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: I hope i'm not interrupting anything. I just -- I really wanted to talk \r\nto you and -- actually, I -- I have a confession I need to make. ",
        "Jamal: Sorry I was gone so long. I was going to call you and everything. ",
        "Alison: No, no, jamal, I'm -- i'm not upset. Listen, I know that valerie was \r\nreally freaked out about everything that happened last night, you know? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: And I know that she needed somebody there. I'm not upset, i'm not \r\nmad, I'm not jealous. ",
        "Jamal: You're not? ",
        "Alison: No. Jamal, i look at what our friends are going through, and I see \r\nhow they've been torn apart, you know, and that's happened because they stopped \r\nbelieving in each other. And I just -- I don't want that to happen to us. I \r\ndon't want that to happen to us ever again. ",
        "Jamal: I don't either, baby. ",
        "Ian: What i'm asking you is, is there some kind of a loophole or something \r\nthat we can work with? Didn't you just get through telling me that you're the \r\nattorney? All right, perfect, see what you can do. I'm -- I miss my son. That's \r\nall. Ok. Do what you can, please. I'm sorry. All right, i -- ",
        "[knock on door] ",
        "ian: I've got to go. Thanks. ",
        "Eve: Hi. Are you up for a couple of visitors? ",
        "jamal: Baby, we are forever. You know that. ",
        "Alison: I do. I just -- I don't want anything to ever come between us ever \r\nagain. ",
        "Jamal: Look, you don't have anything to worry about. Ok, this is all over \r\nwith. ",
        "Alison: There is something that i sort of wanted to talk to you about that \r\nhas been on my mind a little. ",
        "Jamal: Uh-oh. Here we go. ",
        "Alison: No, no, this is good, this is good. It's about hope. ",
        "Jamal: Right -- look -- ",
        "alison: And I just wanted to let you know, jamal, that if you want to pursue \r\na relationship with her, with your daughter, then i think that you should. And I \r\nwill stand behind you 1,000%. ",
        "Jamal: You really mean that? ",
        "Alison: Your little girl is important, i know that. ",
        "Jamal: No, yeah, yeah, yes. Yes, she is. And that's why i -- that's why i \r\nthink i should leave it alone. ",
        "Alison: What? I -- i thought that you said that, you know, dara was going to \r\nhelp you find the hartmans. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, I did, I did, and she hasn't come up with anything. I \r\nmean, not a trace, and i'm taking that as a sign that i need to back off. ",
        "Alison: Are you sure? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you know the hartmans, they're good people. You know, and hope, \r\nshe's really lucky to be with them. You know? I mean, they really do. They love \r\nher like -- like she was their own. And the fact of the matter is, is that she \r\nis theirs. And, seriously, baby, the three of them, they're a family, ok, and I \r\nhave no right to mess in that. ",
        "Alison: Even though you are her dad? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, we share some d.N.A. You and I both know that's not what makes a \r\nfather. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah, we both do. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and I think I've really disrupted things enough. I scared the \r\nhartmans out of town, i put this whole family on the run. And you -- that's just \r\nnot right. ",
        "Alison: You're a good man. ",
        "Jamal: No, no. I just want what's good for hope. Ok? And for everybody else, \r\ntoo. ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Jamal: But I won't forget that you were behind me, baby. ",
        "Alison: Forever, jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I was supposed to go pick up a shift at the recovery room, but I \r\ncan call in and -- ",
        "alison: No. No, no, no. Don't, no, no, no. It's -- I'll be fine. ",
        "Jamal: All right, well, I guess I'll go to work, then. ",
        "Alison: Ok, yeah, and, you know, i'll just go do, like, regular stuff and \r\nmaybe tonight we can get together and have a nice evening. ",
        "Jamal: Ah. Sounds like a plan to me. ",
        "Alison: Ok. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",
        "Alison: I'll let you go. You make me some money. ",
        "Jamal: All right, i'll see you later. ",
        "Rafe: Is this a bad time? ",
        "Ian: Hello, little man. How's it going? ",
        "Eve: Aw -- now, see, look at that. He's so calm and happy already. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "[Eve laughs] ",
        "ian: You shouldn't have brought him. ",
        "Eve: What, I thought I was doing something nice. ",
        "Ian: Well, you are, but we're still on thin ice with the social services. ",
        "Eve: I thought you'd be happy about this, ian. ",
        "Ian: Of course I'm happy, but if we're caught with him here -- ",
        "eve: Oh, great. You know what? You're absolutely right. Here, let me have \r\nhim. I'll take him and we're going to go. Ok, danny. It's ok, sweet pea. Let's \r\ngo. ",
        "Ian: I -- i understand what you were doing. You want him to be happy, you \r\nwant him to have a sense of normalcy. I understand all that. ",
        "Eve: I want that for us, too. ",
        "Ian: Picking up the pieces is not going to be that easy. We can't just forget \r\nwhat happened between us. ",
        "Eve: Why? That was because of caleb. He's dead now. And if we can just forget \r\nabout everything and we can get -- ",
        "ian: I don't know that. I don't know. I don't know if I can forget that you \r\nwouldn't trust me, you wouldn't believe in me. And I don't expect you to forget \r\nwhat happened between lucy and me. ",
        "Eve: Are you saying that it's too late for us? And that our marriage is \r\nbeyond repair? ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "eve: Who's that? Are you expecting someone? ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "[Daniel cries] ",
        "eve: Shh, shh, shh. ",
        "Ian: Shh. ",
        "Eve: Shh. ",
        "Ian: Guess who? ",
        "Eve: Who is it? ",
        "Ian: Our court-appointed counselor is here. ",
        "Eve: Ian, if she catches us with danny, we're going to lose him for good. \r\nWhat are we going to do? ",
        "Lucy: How's livvie holding up? ",
        "Kevin: She's been sleeping since we came home. ",
        "Lucy: She really needs her rest, I'm sure. ",
        "Kevin: She's been through a lot. ",
        "Lucy: It was a very, very brave thing she did. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you took a big chance yourself making caleb think you were dead.\r\n",
        "Lucy: No big deal. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I don't even want to think about what could have happened if he \r\nfound out. ",
        "Lucy: But he didn't and so everything turned out fine. Maybe not everything.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Is this where the confession comes in? ",
        "Lucy: I'm stalling. Yeah, it's supposed to come in right here. I've been \r\nracking my brain, going over and over how to tell you, and i just -- i can't \r\nseem to get it to come out. But now obviously is the time. Ok. This thing \r\nhappened a few weeks ago. I think it -- it started when you moved eve into your \r\nhome with danny. No, I just -- I didn't know what to make of that, didn't handle \r\nthat well. And, well, then I told you about christina, that I'd seen my baby, \r\nand you really didn't believe me. I think that just about -- it did. It just \r\nabout killed me and it just -- doc, i went a little crazy at that time, I think. \r\nI think it was dark times for everybody, but it was really dark for me. And I \r\nwas confused and frustrated and angry and i was very, very lonely. Very lonely \r\nand -- I -- i slept with ian. And I didn't mean for it to happen. In fact, i'm \r\nnot sure how it happened, but -- ",
        "kevin: I already know about you and ian, lucy. I've known about it for a \r\nwhile. ",
        "Lucy: You didn't say anything to me? ",
        "Kevin: Well, compared to what everyone else has been through, it hardly \r\nmatters now, does it? ",
        "Lucy: It doesn't matter? ",
        "Kevin: What i mean, lucy, is that -- ",
        "lucy: Wait -- what -- what -- you -- did you hear what you just said? It \r\ndoesn't matter? I just told you I slept with another man. What does that say \r\nabout me? Well, what does it -- what does that say about you? What does that say \r\nabout us, our entire relationship? Well, what? ",
        "Alison: Oh, my gosh. What are you doing here? I thought your work here was \r\ndone, and I didn't know if maybe you were, like, going back up to heaven or \r\nwherever you angels go. ",
        "Rafe: Wrong again. ",
        "Alison: Does that mean you get to stay here on earth? ",
        "Rafe: A little while. ",
        "Alison: You do? Oh, that's great! Oh, I'm so happy. ",
        "Rafe: Just till christmas eve. ",
        "Alison: Christmas eve? I -- but that's only a few weeks away. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Well, that was always the deal. I had just so much time to help \r\nget rid of caleb and then to clean up the mess he left behind, so -- ",
        "alison: Wait -- mess -- clean up -- how? ",
        "Rafe: Well, you know, I just have -- you know what? You -- you -- I've told \r\nyou too much already. ",
        "Alison: Oh, stop it. Come here. Please, just bend the rules a little bit. \r\nCome here and sit down. Tell me. I mean, because I could be really good with \r\ncleanup, you know. I could really help you. ",
        "Rafe: Hmm. I have to reunite the couples that caleb destroyed. ",
        "Alison: Reunite them? Yeah. Honey, did you see the couples last night? \r\nThey're not doing so good, and I highly doubt that you're going to sort of get \r\nthem back together by christmas eve. ",
        "Rafe: Well, it's tricky, but I have a plan. ",
        "Alison: Well, you know, at least you don't have to sort of mess with one \r\ncouple. I mean, jamal and I, we sort of came through it in the end. ",
        "Rafe: I'm glad to hear that. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: It's good. ",
        "Alison: Well, it wouldn't have happened, i mean, if you hadn't have \r\nstraightened me out. ",
        "Rafe: What are you talking about? ",
        "Alison: I was a little out of control with the whole valerie and hope thing. \r\nYou know? I mean, I really could have blown it, but you sort of sat me down and \r\ntalked me through it and made me stop and think, you know? And so i sort of like \r\nto think of myself a little more like you. I mean, I'm not like an angel or \r\nanything like that. I mean, I'm really -- I'm far from it. Really far. But, you \r\nknow, i'm a lot less selfish. And I do have more faith -- faith that, you know, \r\ngood will always win in the end, just like you say. ",
        "Rafe: You didn't learn that from me. It's just part of who you are. You're a \r\nspecial person. ",
        "Alison: Thank you. But I sort of like to think that maybe it rubbed off on me \r\na little bit, you know. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, maybe you rubbed off a little on me, too. ",
        "Eve: Oh, I got to hide him. We cannot let her -- ",
        "ian: No, no. ",
        "Eve: See us here with danny. ",
        "Ian: Hang on, hang on, hold on, hold on. We're not going to do that. He \r\nbelongs with us. We're here to protect him. It's time we face these people. ",
        "Eve: You are right. Your da is right. Ok. Open the door. Go ahead. I'm ready. \r\nYes. ",
        "Ian: Suzanne, what a surprise. ",
        "Suzanne: I'm sorry to barge in on you. ",
        "Ian: Nah, come on in. It's all right. ",
        "Suzanne: Mrs. Thornhart, you've got daniel. Is dr. Collins here? ",
        "Ian: No, collins isn't here. It's just me and my wife and my son. He's very \r\nhappy, as you can tell. ",
        "Suzanne: But, dr. Thornhart, I -- ",
        "ian: I know what the court said, and I really don't care. We're taking care \r\nof our son, he's protected, he's happy. ",
        "Suzanne: What i came to tell you and your wife is that -- ",
        "[baby coos] ",
        "suzanne: You've been granted back custody of daniel. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Suzanne: The paperwork's going through as we speak. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: So what -- this is over? ",
        "Suzanne: Yes. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my god, I can't believe it! ",
        "Ian: How -- how did this happen? ",
        "Suzanne: Well, let's just say i saw the light. ",
        "Eve: Excuse me? ",
        "Suzanne: That sunrise this morning -- well, silly as it sounds, you know, \r\nsuddenly in that moment, everything became clear to me. I -- i knew that you \r\nguys were no threat to this child and that you deserved to have daniel back with \r\nyou. ",
        "Eve: It's really over? We got our son back. Oh, danny. ",
        "Ian: He's finally home. ",
        "Kevin: I don't get this. Now you're the injured party? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I feel so terrible already about sleeping with ian, but it's \r\nmaking it worse that you don't care. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, oh, I see. You -- you want to feel better? All right. Well, how's \r\nthis, lucy? When i found out what happened, it nearly killed me. I got \r\nfalling-down drunk, I made a complete ass out of myself -- oh, and here's one \r\nfor you. I actually came on to eve. How's that? ",
        "Lucy: It's terrible. I was right. You are still attracted to her. ",
        "Kevin: No. You weren't right, lucy. I'm not attracted to eve. I am completely \r\nin love with you. Or did you not just hear me say that it nearly killed me when \r\ni found out what you'd done? ",
        "Lucy: I heard you say it doesn't matter, that it's just not -- ",
        "kevin: And that's the only thing you heard? Wow. There's a shocker. Well, \r\nwhat do you want from me, lucy? You want me to yell? You want me to scream? You \r\nwant me to throw things? Fine! How's that? You feel better now? You satisfied? \r\nDo you understand that i am hurt and I'm angry? But you know what hurts the \r\nmost? Actually, you know what hurts the most. It's that we've been down this \r\nroad before. And I was actually idiot enough to think that -- never mind. Don't \r\nsay anything. We've all been through too much, lucy, and right now my daughter \r\nis going to need all the help she can get, and i intend to be there for her, ok?\r\n",
        "Lucy: Ok. Yes, i understand. She should be your number one priority. I get \r\nthat completely. ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: And serena's mine. I need to spend some time with her, and I need to \r\nfind a way to get those images of christina out of my head. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's settled. So now what? ",
        "Lucy: I guess we just take a break. ",
        "Kevin: Good idea. We need a break. ",
        "Lucy: Right. I hate to bring this up. It's very inappropriate, but I have to \r\nbecause of the timing. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: The christmas party we were planning. Our -- our surprise wedding. What \r\nhappens to that? ",
        "Valerie: Jamal, thank god you're here. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, you ok? ",
        "Valerie: No. I just got kicked out of the retreat. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, man, valerie. ",
        "Valerie: I don't know what i'm going to do. I don't have anywhere to go, I \r\ndon't have any money, I don't have any family. ",
        "Jamal: You're not going to be on the streets, so just calm down. Just crash \r\nat me and ali's place until you get things together, ok? ",
        "Valerie: Are you sure alison's going to be ok about it? ",
        "Jamal: Hey, trust me. Everything between me and alison's cool now, all right?\r\n",
        "Valerie: All right. ",
        "Ian: Can you believe it? No more hiding and sneaking around. ",
        "Eve: I know. Isn't it great? Listen, I'm going to go tell kevin the great \r\nnews, and I'm going to get danny's things, ok? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. This is something, isn't it? ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Ian: You, me, the baby -- we'll be together again. ",
        "Eve: Will we? ",
        "Ian: Well, that's the question, isn't it? ",
        "Eve: We have to decide. Do we still have a marriage or don't we? ",
        "Kevin: Well, I guess given where we are -- where everybody is -- the \r\nchristmas party doesn't seem like such a good idea. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Right. If everybody's where i am, they just want to curl up \r\nunder a blanket and wait till this year is over. ",
        "Kevin: It's pretty much how i feel. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, I have the invitations at home and I'll go home and get rid \r\nof them. ",
        "Kevin: I think it's for the best. ",
        "Lucy: I guess we missed our moment again, doc. ",
        "Kevin: We never can seem to get it right. ",
        "Alison: I, for one, love a challenge, and I'm very good at playing \r\nmatchmaker. ",
        "Rafe: So you really want to help? ",
        "Alison: Yes, of course i do. They are my friends, and you are my friend, too.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Ok. So the thing is, we got to be smart about this. It's not like we \r\ncan just shake some love dust around and expect them to fall into each other's \r\narms. ",
        "Alison: Wait, wait. Is there such a thing as love dust? Is there? ",
        "Rafe: Would you get real, please? ",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sorry. I'm talking to an angel in my apartment. It's a \r\nlittle hard. I will try. ",
        "Rafe: Alison, no love dust. ",
        "Alison: Ok, fine. So, you said you had a plan, so what is it? ",
        "Rafe: A party. ",
        "Alison: A party? ",
        "Rafe: And you're invited. ",
        "Alison: Hmm. Ok. ",
        "Alison: Kevin and lucy are having a christmas party? Do they know about this?\r\n",
        "Rafe: Not yet. ",
        ">> Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"port charles: Miracles happen.\" ",
        ">> On the next \"port charles\" -- ",
        "alison: When exactly is valerie coming over? ",
        "Jamal: Well -- ",
        "[knock on door] ",
        "serena: How come you and kevin didn't tell me you guys were having a \r\nchristmas party? ",
        "Livvie: I'm going to go talk to jack, and maybe there is a chance for all of \r\nus. "
