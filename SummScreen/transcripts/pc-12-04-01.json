I've been racking my brain, going over and over how to tell you, and i just -- i can't seem to get it to come out. But now obviously is the time. Ok. This thing happened a few weeks ago. I think it -- it started when you moved eve into your home with danny. No, I just -- I didn't know what to make of that, didn't handle that well. And, well, then I told you about christina, that I'd seen my baby, and you really didn't believe me. I think that just about -- it did. It just about killed me and it just -- doc, i went a little crazy at that time, I think. I think it was dark times for everybody, but it was really dark for me. And I was confused and frustrated and angry and i was very, very lonely. Very lonely and -- I -- i slept with ian. And I didn't mean for it to happen. In fact, i'm not sure how it happened, but -- ", "kevin: I already know about you and ian, lucy. I've known about it for a while. ", "Lucy: You didn't say anything to me?

What does that say about me? Well, what does it -- what does that say about you? What does that say about us, our entire relationship? Well, what? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Oh, my gosh. What are you doing here? I thought your work here was done, and I didn't know if maybe you were, like, going back up to heaven or wherever you angels go. ", "Rafe: Wrong again.

", "Alison: Christmas eve? I -- but that's only a few weeks away. ", "Rafe: Yeah. Well, that was always the deal. I had just so much time to help get rid of caleb and then to clean up the mess he left behind, so -- ", "alison: Wait -- mess -- clean up -- how? ", "Rafe: Well, you know, I just have -- you know what? You -- you -- I've told you too much already. ", "Alison: Oh, stop it. Come here. Please, just bend the rules a little bit. Come here and sit down. Tell me. I mean, because I could be really good with cleanup, you know. I could really help you. ", "Rafe: Hmm. I have to reunite the couples that caleb destroyed. ", "Alison: Reunite them? Yeah. Honey, did you see the couples last night? They're not doing so good, and I highly doubt that you're going to sort of get them back together by christmas eve. ", "Rafe: Well, it's tricky, but I have a plan. ", "Alison: Well, you know, at least you don't have to sort of mess with one couple. I mean, jamal and I, we sort of came through it in the end. ", "Rafe: I'm glad to hear that. ", "Alison: Yeah. ", "Rafe: It's good. ", "Alison: Well, it wouldn't have happened, i mean, if you hadn't have straightened me out. ", "Rafe: What are you talking about? ", "Alison: I was a little out of control with the whole valerie and hope thing. You know? I mean, I really could have blown it, but you sort of sat me down and talked me through it and made me stop and think, you know? And so i sort of like to think of myself a little more like you. I mean, I'm not like an angel or anything like that. I mean, I'm really -- I'm far from it. Really far. But, you know, i'm a lot less selfish. And I do have more faith -- faith that, you know, good will always win in the end, just like you say. ", "Rafe: You didn't learn that from me. It's just part of who you are. You're a special person. ", "Alison: Thank you. But I sort of like to think that maybe it rubbed off on me a little bit, you know. ", "Rafe: Yeah, well, maybe you rubbed off a little on me, too.

", "Ian: No, collins isn't here. It's just me and my wife and my son. He's very happy, as you can tell. ", "Suzanne: But, dr. Thornhart, I -- ", "ian: I know what the court said, and I really don't care. We're taking care of our son, he's protected, he's happy.

", "Suzanne: The paperwork's going through as we speak. ", "Eve: What? ", "Ian: So what -- this is over? ", "Suzanne: Yes. ", "Eve: Oh, my god, I can't believe it! ", "Ian: How -- how did this happen? ", "Suzanne: Well, let's just say i saw the light. ", "Eve: Excuse me? ", "Suzanne: That sunrise this morning -- well, silly as it sounds, you know, suddenly in that moment, everything became clear to me. I -- i knew that you guys were no threat to this child and that you deserved to have daniel back with you. ", "Eve: It's really over? We got our son back. Oh, danny. ", "Ian: He's finally home. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: I don't get this. Now you're the injured party? ", "Lucy: Well, I feel so terrible already about sleeping with ian, but it's making it worse that you don't care. ", "Kevin: Oh, oh, I see. You -- you want to feel better? All right. Well, how's this, lucy? When i found out what happened, it nearly killed me. I got falling-down drunk, I made a complete ass out of myself -- oh, and here's one for you. I actually came on to eve. How's that? ", "Lucy: It's terrible. I was right. You are still attracted to her. ", "Kevin: No. You weren't right, lucy. I'm not attracted to eve. I am completely in love with you. Or did you not just hear me say that it nearly killed me when i found out what you'd done? ", "Lucy: I heard you say it doesn't matter, that it's just not -- ", "kevin: And that's the only thing you heard? Wow. There's a shocker. Well, what do you want from me, lucy? You want me to yell? You want me to scream? You want me to throw things? Fine! How's that? You feel better now? You satisfied? Do you understand that i am hurt and I'm angry? But you know what hurts the most? Actually, you know what hurts the most. It's that we've been down this road before. And I was actually idiot enough to think that -- never mind. Don't say anything. We've all been through too much, lucy, and right now my daughter is going to need all the help she can get, and i intend to be there for her, ok?", "Lucy: Ok. Yes, i understand. She should be your number one priority. I get that completely. ", "Kevin: Yes. ", "Lucy: And serena's mine. I need to spend some time with her, and I need to find a way to get those images of christina out of my head. ", "Kevin: Well, that's settled. So now what? ", "Lucy: I guess we just take a break. ", "Kevin: Good idea. We need a break. ", "Lucy: Right. I hate to bring this up. It's very inappropriate, but I have to because of the timing. ", "Kevin: What? ", "Lucy: The christmas party we were planning. Our -- our surprise wedding. What happens to that? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Valerie: Jamal, thank god you're here. ", "Jamal: Hey, you ok? ", "Valerie: No. I just got kicked out of the retreat. ", "Jamal: Oh, man, valerie. ", "Valerie: I don't know what i'm going to do. I don't have anywhere to go, I don't have any money, I don't have any family. ", "Jamal: You're not going to be on the streets, so just calm down. Just crash at me and ali's place until you get things together, ok? ", "Valerie: Are you sure alison's going to be ok about it? ", "Jamal: Hey, trust me. Everything between me and alison's cool now, all right?", "Valerie: All right. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Can you believe it? No more hiding and sneaking around. ", "Eve: I know. Isn't it great? Listen, I'm going to go tell kevin the great news, and I'm going to get danny's things, ok? ", "Ian: Yeah. This is something, isn't it? ", "Eve: Mm-hmm. ", "Ian: You, me, the baby -- we'll be together again. ", "Eve: Will we? ", "Ian: Well, that's the question, isn't it? ", "Eve: We have to decide. Do we still have a marriage or don't we? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Well, I guess given where we are -- where everybody is -- the christmas party doesn't seem like such a good idea. ", "Lucy: Right. Right. If everybody's where i am, they just want to curl up under a blanket and wait till this year is over. ", "Kevin: It's pretty much how i feel. ", "Lucy: Ok, well, I have the invitations at home and I'll go home and get rid of them. ", "Kevin: I think it's for the best. ", "Lucy: I guess we missed our moment again, doc. ", "Kevin: We never can seem to get it right. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: I, for one, love a challenge, and I'm very good at playing matchmaker. ", "Rafe: So you really want to help? ", "Alison: Yes, of course i do. They are my friends, and you are my friend, too.", "Rafe: Ok. So the thing is, we got to be smart about this. It's not like we can just shake some love dust around and expect them to fall into each other's arms. ", "Alison: Wait, wait. Is there such a thing as love dust? Is there? ", "Rafe: Would you get real, please? ", "Alison: Well, I'm sorry. I'm talking to an angel in my apartment. It's a little hard. I will try. ", "Rafe: Alison, no love dust. ", "Alison: Ok, fine. So, you said you had a plan, so what is it? ", "Rafe: A party. ", "Alison: A party? ", "Rafe: And you're invited. ", "Alison: Hmm. Ok. ", "Alison: Kevin and lucy are having a christmas party?
