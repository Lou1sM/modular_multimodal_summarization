        "Stephen: Of course. ",
        "Elizabeth: I can't believe that \r\nI have just given up millions and millions of dollars and I don't even care \r\nabout it. Everything in my life has just changed so much since you. ",
        "Stephen: Hopefully in good \r\nways. ",
        "Elizabeth: Wonderful ways. I \r\njust wish I could figure out why I get so sick sometimes, though. I mean, it's \r\nreally hard to explain. It's like I'm -- like I'm hungry for something. \n",
        "Stephen: Well, I told you, you \r\nknow, I'm flying in a specialist to give you a complete examination. ",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm. When? \n",
        "Stephen: Soon. In the meantime, \r\nyou just keep drinking the water. It'll make you feel better, ok?\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: Mm-hmm. Hey, hey, \r\nhey, hey. Are you going to be long? ",
        "Stephen: Excuse me? ",
        "Elizabeth: Here, playing?\r\n",
        "Stephen: Playing? No. This is \r\nworking. This is my work. ",
        "Elizabeth: I mean -- that's \r\nwhat I meant. I was just hoping that, you know, we could spend the day together, \r\njust the -- ",
        "Stephen: What did I just say to \r\nyou? Didn't I just say I'm working? ",
        "Elizabeth: Yes, you did. Sorry.\r\n",
        "Stephen: Hey, look, I'm sorry I \r\nyelled at you, you know. The music's important. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I know. I know \r\nit is. I shouldn't have said anything like -- I just keep finding it so hard to \r\nkeep my hands off of you.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: The sooner I get \r\nstarted, the sooner I'll get done. ",
        "Elizabeth: I guess you're \r\nright. Well, get started. Get started. I'll see you soon. ",
        "Stephen: Don't forget -- if you \r\nstart feeling -- ",

        "Jamal: You're going to get \r\nsomething to eat, ok, and then you're going to spend some quality time with your \r\nman. And that's what you're going to do. And I know you can't resist that, \r\neither. ",

        "Marissa: And you know, I proved \r\nthat to you last night. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, there's nothing \r\nwrong with proving it again. Hey -- you're not still mad at me for making you \r\nquit the band, are you? ",
        "Marissa: No. Why would you even \r\nsay that? ",
        "Jamal: I don't know. I've been \r\nthinking about it a lot, you know? I just -- it was just kind of -- you know, \r\nit's a lot to ask and -- but every time I think about Stephen, it's just --\r\n\n",

        "Livvie: Yeah, and I was just \r\nwondering -- I mean, I was hoping that maybe you could help us reconnect. I miss \r\nher friendship so much. I'm sorry -- did I say something wrong? ",
        "Elizabeth: I was wondering how \r\nlong it was going to be till I had an opportunity to meet you, Livvie. You \r\ndidn't for one minute think that Alison and I were close, did you? ",
