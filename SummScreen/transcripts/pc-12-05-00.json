        "Jack: What's wrong? ",
        "Livvie: Look, we have to talk. ",
        "Jack: Why? I'd rather do this. ",
        "Livvie: No, I'm serious. I'm serious. I want to know more about you, Jack, \r\nand not just that you're a great kisser. ",
        "Jack: Oh, more about me. Okay. So, what do you want to know? ",
        "Livvie: Well, I want to know who you are, Jack, and why you came to Port \r\nCharles. ",

        "Chris: Hey, new record for a successful triple-bypass -- five hours, 32 \r\nminutes. ",
        "Colleen: Congratulations. ",
        "Chris: Where is everybody? I know this is the graveyard shift, but this is \r\nridiculous. ",
        "Colleen: You haven't heard? ",
        "Chris: Heard what? ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Colleen: Just -- sixth floor nurses' desk. Yeah, let me check. ",
        "Chris: Never mind. ",
        "",
        "Karen: They're sure it was a car bomb? ",
        "Frank: Well, I don't think anything's been confirmed yet. ",
        "Gabriela: It's a wonder more people weren't seriously injured. ",
        "Karen: But two people are dead. They know that much, right? ",
        "Joe: Yeah. Two bodies were found in the car. ",
        "Karen: It was them -- I mean, the thought of Ian and Eve being -- ",
        "Gabriela: Hey, let's not even go there, okay? Like Frank said, nobody knows \r\nanything for sure yet. ",
        "Joe: We know it was Ian's car, and nobody's seen either one of them since.\r\n",
        "Karen: You know what? That doesn't mean anything. They could be anywhere. ",
        "Frank: Eve never showed up at the hospital, Karen. They called her. She said \r\nshe was on her way. ",
        "Karen: You know what? I don't care what any of you say. Until I see proof, I \r\nwon't believe it. ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, neither will I. ",
        "Joe: Look, I don't want to believe it any more than you guys -- ",
        "Frank: But the fact is it doesn't look good. ",
        "Chris: Somebody want to tell me what's going on around here? What is a nurse \r\nand a paramedic doing in the on-call room? I hope you two have a good reason.\r\n",
        "Frank: Ian Thornhart and Eve Lambert might have been killed tonight. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: This is hers. It's -- it's Eve's wedding ring. ",
        "Mac: We found it in the car. It was all that was left of the explosion. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no! No! No! ",
        "Kevin: This can't be true, Mac. This has to be some kind of a mistake. ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Kevin: It's not true! ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Mac: Lucy! Lucy! Lucy, let him go. It's okay. Let him go. ",
        "Lucy: Mac -- Mac, who would do such a thing, and why would they do this? ",
        "Mac: I don't know, Lucy, but I'm going to find out. ",
        "Victor: Something happened. What happened? ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Victor -- listen -- they found Eve's rings. ",
        "Victor: Found it where? ",
        "Kevin: In the car, Victor. In the car -- what was left of it. ",
        "Victor: I'm so sorry. Son, I'm so sorry. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Mac: Scorpio. All right, yeah, I'll be there. Bomb squad's on their way. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Mac, we got to pray they find the answer because Doc's going to \r\nneed that so much. ",
        "Mac: Victor, can I talk to you a minute? ",
        "Victor: What is it? ",
        "Mac: Bomb squad's on their way. I don't think Kevin should be here. ",
        "Victor: Well, that's not going to be easy to get him to leave now. ",
        "Lucy: I'll take him home. I'll do it. ",
        "Victor: I'll go with you. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Mac: No, no, I -- actually, I'd like you to stay. ",
        "Victor: He needs me. ",
        "Mac: Yes, he does, but he also needs answers. ",
        "Victor: You want me to help you find out who did this? ",
        "Mac: I want you to check with the Agency. If this wasn't local, we have to \r\nmove fast. ",
        "Victor: His life is falling apart. ",
        "Lucy: Victor, listen, I think Mac is right. What Kevin needs more than \r\nanything else right now is to find out who did this, so you stay and help Mac \r\nand I'll take him home. It's ok. I'll take him home. ",
        "Lucy: Hey, Doc, I'm going to take you home. ",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Lucy: It -- it's okay. ",
        "Kevin: I said I'm not going. ",
        "Lucy: I know. ",
        "Kevin: I'm not going. ",
        "Lucy: But there's nothing else we can do here. We need to go home. ",
        "Victor: Monk, she's right. ",
        "Mac: Kevin, we will let you know the minute we find out anything -- anything.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. ",
        "",
        "Chris: I mean, you only think they died in a car bombing? You got to be \r\nkidding. How is this possible? Could someone explain it to me, please? Why isn't \r\nanyone saying anything? Okay, fine, I know I'm not everybody's favorite person \r\nhere, but don't shut me out, okay? ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Chris: Because if this is true, then we need to -- ",
        "Frank: Yeah? Yeah. Thanks, Mac. ",
        "Karen: What? ",
        "Frank: Mac found Eve's wedding ring in the burned-out car. ",
        "Chris: I can't believe they're gone. ",
        "Frank: Like you care. ",
        "Chris: Of course I care. ",
        "Frank: Well, where do you get off even pretending that you give a damn? ",
        "Chris: Not that I have to explain myself to you, but Eve was my friend -- my \r\nbest friend. ",
        "Karen: You sure had a funny way of showing it. ",
        "Chris: And Eve knew how I felt about her. We may not have been as close as we \r\nonce were, but she knew how I felt about her. And as for Thornhart, sure, we \r\ndidn't exactly get along. ",
        "Joe: You made his life a living hell every chance you got. ",
        "Chris: Doesn't mean I wished him any harm. My God, no one deserves this. ",
        "Frank: Oh, save it. ",
        "Joe: Why don't you just leave, Ramsey? You don't belong here anyway. ",
        "Chris: Well, this is the on-call room, and the last time I checked, I'm the \r\nchief resident. ",
        "Joe: And everybody knows it should have been Eve. ",
        "Chris: We all started out together -- you, me, Eve, Karen. We started out as \r\na team. ",
        "Joe: We may have started out that way, but you stopped being one of us a long \r\ntime ago. ",
        "Chris: Maybe I did. Gabby, Livvie was at the Recovery Room earlier, right?\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Yeah, I saw her at the party. ",
        "Chris: Well, is she okay? ",
        "Gabriela: I think she left before the explosion, but I didn't see her \r\nafterwards, so I don't know. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Oh. Oh, man. Now, that's a tough question. ",
        "Livvie: Then let's just start with something a little bit easier, okay? ",
        "Jack: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: How is it that you keep showing up in my life every time I need you \r\n-- someone? ",
        "Jack: Livvie -- Livvie, Livvie, Livvie. Can't you see that we have this \r\nincredible connection? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but we barely even know each other. ",
        "Jack: Well, I mean, maybe it's because we've been through a lot of the same \r\nstuff. ",
        "Livvie: Like what? ",
        "Jack: Like -- okay. You lost your mom, right? Well, I lost my mom, too. Only \r\n-- ",
        "Livvie: Only what? ",
        "Jack: Well, she died. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea. ",
        "Jack: And that's what draws me to the water, which is another thing we have \r\nin common, you know, the water. We're both drawn to it. ",
        "Livvie: Okay. So why are you? ",
        "Jack: Ooh. ",
        "Livvie: Jack? ",
        "Jack: It was the river, a lot like the one we go to, where I scattered my \r\nmom's ashes. ",
        "Livvie: Wow. Were you close to her? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, for the short time we were together. ",
        "Livvie: What, you mean she died when you were little? ",
        "Jack: No, see, we were separated for most of our life. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, why? ",
        "Jack: Well, that's kind of complicated, but the point is, is by the time we \r\nfinally found each other, it was too late. She was dying. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Jack. ",
        "Jack: Hey -- ",
        "Livvie: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Jack: I always thought that if we could have found a better doctor, then \r\nmaybe he could have saved her. But -- we were so poor, it didn't even matter. We \r\ndidn't have the money to afford insurance or another doctor, so -- ",

        "Jack: Go ahead. Answer it. ",

        "Livvie: Yeah, it was so weird. What happened? ",

        "Chris: Livvie, it's me again. Please call me the minute you get this. \r\nSomething's happened, okay -- something I'd rather not get into over the phone, \r\nespecially on the machine, so just call me, okay? I need to see you. ",
        "[Answering machine beeps] ",
        "Jack: Sounds important. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, it can wait. I feel bad bringing up your mom and all that \r\nstuff. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, look, it's no big deal, all right? ",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm not going to push you anymore. But if you ever want to talk \r\nabout it, or anything -- ",
        "Jack: All right. You're my girl. So, who's the guy who keeps on calling? ",
        "Livvie: A friend, Chris. ",
        "Jack: Right. Pizza Shack Man. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, that's the one. ",
        "Jack: Well, I could be wrong, but I think Pizza Shack Man wants to be a \r\nlittle more than friends. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I don't care what Pizza Shack Man wants. What matters is \r\nwhat I want. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: It's hard to believe we'll never see them again. ",
        "Karen: I just spoke to Eve earlier today. We were going to go shopping at \r\nthat new outlet mall on the way into the city. ",
        "Gabriela: She really liked to shop. ",
        "Karen: She did. It was more that drive there and back, you know, when you \r\nreally got to talk about everything. ",
        "Gabriela: You guys were close. ",
        "Karen: Well, if it wasn't for her, I don't know if I would have survived this \r\npast year. ",

        "Lucy: Ok. I will. I'll call you a little later. Bye. ",
        "Kevin: What are the leads? ",
        "Lucy: The bomb squad has concluded that it was a professional job. ",
        "Kevin: What else? ",
        "Lucy: They've ruled out Rachel as a suspect. ",
        "Kevin: And who do they suspect? ",
        "Lucy: Victor said he and Mac have a couple theories. One is maybe Eve and Ian \r\nmade some enemies during their investigation, and the other is possibly \r\nsomething from Ian's past. ",
        "Kevin: Ian's past. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. As you know, he worked in a lot of tension-filled areas before he \r\ncame to Port Charles, and, you know -- you knew -- you knew how he liked to -- \r\nyou know, he had a way of stirring things up. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, he also had a way of dragging my wife into it! You \r\nknow I talked to him just today? And I thanked him for saving your life. And you \r\nknow what he said? \"Well, Kevin, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for putting Eve into \r\ndanger. I'm so sorry for putting Eve on the line.\" He was sorry! Well, I \r\nhope he rots in hell. You know why? Because he should have left when he was \r\nsupposed to! And something else -- why did he have to have to come to this town \r\nin the first place? He never should have come here. And I wish he had died \r\nalone. Why did he have to take my wife with him? ",

        "Gabriela: I will never forget my first day in the E.R. I was a nervous wreck, \r\ncouldn't even start a simple I.V., and Ian -- well, let's just say he didn't cut \r\nme a whole lot of slack. But, you know, it was the best thing he could have done \r\nbecause I learned real quick. And I went on to learn a whole lot more from both \r\nof them. ",
