        "Scott: Hey, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Hey. ",
        "Scott: I got here as soon as I could. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Where's Serena? ",
        "Scott: Um, she's at school. Gail's picking her up. She should be along pretty \r\nsoon. What's up? ",
        "Lucy: Um -- there was an explosion. ",
        "Scott: Yeah. I heard about that. Some car blew up outside the Recovery Room.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Pal, it was Eve and Ian. ",
        "Scott: I -- are you sure? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it -- it was Ian's car. And they both died in the explosion. ",
        "[Scott sighs] ",
        "Scott: You know, I didn't know him very well, but he saved your life. He was \r\na friend of yours, right? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, he's a very -- was a very special man. ",
        "Scott: And Eve, I mean, she was terrific. She was always, you know, out \r\nthere. She had so much life in her. She was always embracing her world. ",
        "Lucy: And, you know, maybe that's what she did a little too much of -- \r\nembrace not just life. ",
        "Scott: What are you talking about? ",
        "Lucy: I think that's what killed her. I think that's probably what killed \r\nboth of them. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: Hi. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I know I should've called first, but when Chris told me, all I \r\nknew is I wanted to see you. ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- uh, come in. ",
        "Livvie: How are you? I mean, I know how you are. I just -- I don't -- I don't \r\nknow what to say. I wish I did, but -- ",
        "Kevin: There is nothing to say. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Kevin, I am so sorry. That's all. I really mean that. I am just \r\nso sorry. ",
        "",
        "Ian: What the hell is this? Oh, God. Eve? You all right? Eve? Eve, wake up! \r\nHey. Rise and shine. Come on, I need your help. ",
        "Eve: What's -- what's going on? ",
        "Ian: Don't ask questions now. Please, I need your help here. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "Ian: If your fingers are loose, try to untie me. ",
        "Eve: Okay. Oh! ",
        "Ian: Wherever we are, we're not staying. And whoever's responsible -- ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "Ian: We don't want to meet them. There! Got it. ",
        "Eve: Okay. Get mine. Get mine. Oh. Ow! ",
        "Ian: Get up. Come on. We got to get out of here. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my head. Oh, my head. Ow. All right. Okay. ",
        "Ian: Whoo. ",
        "Eve: Ian, my -- my wedding rings are gone. ",
        "Ian: We don't have time to look for them now. We got to go. Come on. ",
        "Eve: Okay. ",
        "[Footsteps] ",
        "Ian: Sit down, get down. ",
        "Eve: What -- okay. All right. ",
        "Ian: Put your hands back. Put them back. Ah! ",
        "Man: Hello, Ian. It's been some time. Long time. Much too long. ",
        "Eve: No, Ian! No! No! No! Ian! ",
        "Man: Comforting to know that you can still depend on some things in this \r\never-changing world. And, Eve -- ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "Man: You're even more beautiful than your pictures. ",
        "",
        "Scott: Come on, Eve's dead and may not -- I know you never liked her from the \r\nminute you met her and you were always giving her sort of a hard time. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you -- you know what? Now I realize I was treating her the way \r\nshe deserved to be treated. ",
        "Scott: Then I guess I saw a different girl. ",
        "Lucy: Eve was not faithful. ",
        "Scott: Lucy, I -- I -- ",
        "[Scott sighs] ",
        "Scott: You're angry. I mean, a lot of stuff has happened to you this year.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I'm just tired of it. Don't you see, this is a horrible thing. \r\nI'm so tired of being sad and angry all the time. ",
        "Scott: I know, but you got a lot to be angry about. I mean, I think a lot of \r\nyour anger is still somewhat directed at me for the things that I did wrong. ",
        "[Scott sighs] ",
        "Scott: I don't know. Do you want to slug me about it? I don't know. Will you \r\nfeel better to take -- ",
        "Lucy: No, I -- no! That won't make -- that's silly. ",
        "Scott: Then why don't you hug me? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I don't know what I want to do. I don't know what I want \r\nto do. I just can't believe this is happening! I can't believe they're gone! Eve \r\nand Ian are gone! I can't believe they're dead. How can Eve be dead? I don't \r\nunderstand! ",
        "Serena: Eve's dead? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I keep expecting Eve to walk through the door any minute. I guess we \r\ncan't do anything about that, can we? ",
        "Livvie: I just -- I feel like such an idiot. You know, you always have the \r\nperfect thing to say, just what I need to hear at just the right time and now \r\nthat I'm here, I don't know what I thought -- ",
        "Kevin: I talk a good game, Livvie. I just talk a good game. It's my job. But \r\nno one knows what to do when it comes to death. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Look, I'm -- I'm really sorry. I probably shouldn't have come. \r\nI just thought that because -- well, maybe because I'm -- ",
        "Kevin: Because you're my daughter? ",
        "Livvie: I'm really sorry. I should probably leave. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, don't go. Stay. Please? ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: I can't believe Eve and Ian are gone. ",
        "Gabriela: Something like this happens and it makes me realize that a part of \r\nme has never grown up. And even with everything we see at the hospital, in my \r\nheart, I still believe that everything's going to turn out okay. I mean, \r\neverybody I know, they find somebody to love who loves them back and they live \r\nhappily ever after. ",
        "Joe: Guess a part of me hasn't grown up, then, either. ",
        "Gabriela: At least Eve knew what it felt like to have love in her life. ",
        "Joe: And Ian? ",
        "Gabriela: He never really got a chance to know what it feels like. ",
        "Joe: That's not true. He found somebody, Gabby, just before all this \r\nhappened. Ian fell in love. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Hardheaded fool. Although, I have a feeling you would do the same thing \r\nagain if the occasion arose. ",
        "Ian: Hmm -- ",
        "Eve: Oh -- shh. Wait, wait, wait. Lie still. ",
        "Ian: Eve, I -- ",
        "Eve: Lie still. Lie still. You may not have a concussion, but you've got a \r\npretty deep gash, okay? Shh. ",
        "Ian: What are you using? ",
        "Eve: Soap and water. It's the only thing I could find in this place, in this \r\nthing they think passes for a bathroom. ",
        "Ian: Welcome to my world. ",
        "Eve: Hey. ",
        "[Ian groans] ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: I'm sorry you're here. ",
        "Eve: You know what I wish you would tell me is who your friend is, the guy \r\nwho looks like he's straight out of a really bad spy movie. What's his name, \r\nIan? How does he know you? And better yet, how does he know me? ",
        "Ian: He can find out whatever he needs to. He's a monster, Eve. He's a \r\nwalking nightmare. And his name is Harris. And once upon a time, I thought I'd \r\nkilled him. ",
        "",
        "Scott: Serena, listen. See, it was an accident. ",
        "Lucy: Eve was in Dr. Thornhart's car. And the police believe somebody was out \r\nto hurt Dr. Thornhart, and Eve got caught in the middle of it. ",
        "Serena: Caught how? ",
        "Scott: Serena, the car -- it blew up. ",
        "Serena: With them in it? ",
        "Lucy: I'm so sorry, sweet pea. I am so sorry. ",
        "Serena: But what about Kevin? ",
        "Scott: Well, he's going to be sad, you know, like you and me are. ",
        "Serena: I want to go see him. I want to go see him. ",
        "Lucy: If you want to go see Kevin, okay, fine. We can take you. ",
        "Serena: Can we stop by the firehouse on the way? There's something I have to \r\nbring. I know it will help him. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Hot chocolate. ",
        "Livvie: I figured you must like it because -- ",
        "Kevin: Because we have a whole cupboard full of different kinds. Every time \r\nEve goes to the store, she buys -- she bought chocolate. ",
        "Kevin: I know you don't like her, but, you know, you give her a chance and -- \r\nshe changed my life, Livvie. I mean, I know Eve's not perfect. I -- I know all \r\ntoo well how exasperating she can be, but that is when she's not being \r\ncompletely irresistible. ",
        "",
        "Eve: You actually tried to kill Harris? ",
        "Ian: I thought I had killed him. ",
        "Eve: How do you know him? ",
        "Ian: Met him at a dinner party in London. He was introduced to me as a \r\nwell-known philanthropist. ",
        "Eve: So he's a really rich guy? ",
        "Ian: Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's a multibillionaire. What he's really after is \r\nunlimited power. I had to run into him a couple of times before I saw what kind \r\nof a man he really was. And then every time I turned around, there he was on the \r\nother side of a deal I was trying to make for the program. ",
        "Eve: Doctors Without Limits, right? ",
        "Ian: Right. I tried to get around him. I did. ",
        "Eve: What happened? ",
        "Ian: You know, I can't do this right now. ",
        "Eve: No, Ian, please. You have to. Please. Explain all of this to me. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: So Eve was your patient? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Kind of a crisis counseling thing. It's a long story, but all \r\nthe interns had to see me. ",
        "Livvie: I guess it wasn't easy to keep that doctor/patient distance. ",
        "Kevin: Not once I got a look at those legs. And that face. We -- we started \r\nout as friends. Eve's an incredible friend. She listens better than anybody. \r\nDoesn't matter what you say. She hears everything. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Go on. ",
        "Ian: There was the most amazing little village in the world, an African \r\nShangri-la. Until the virus came -- deadly virus that attacked the children. But \r\nI came up with an antidote, and I swear I moved heaven and earth to get the \r\nsupplies we needed. And then finally, the call came. The plane was on its way. \r\nThe children would live. ",
        "Eve: What happened? ",
        "Ian: Harris hijacked the shipment. ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. No. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. ",
        "Eve: What happened next? How did you get the shipment in time? ",
        "Ian: I didn't. ",
        "Ian: I got one bead for every child I lost. One bead so I would never forget \r\nthem. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Her eyes, most of all. I tried to paint them once, but there's just no \r\nbrush stroke or color. All that compassion and kindness and -- ",
        "Livvie: And? ",
        "Kevin: And all you can do is love her. That's all, just love her. ",
        "",
        "Ian: There was nothing I could do. I held them in my arms, and I watched over them until they slipped away. And they looked so confused, Eve. And they \r\nnever said a word. There was no blame. ",
        "Eve: It wasn't your fault. ",
        "Ian: I promised them, Eve! I promised life to 13 innocent faces, and I lost \r\nthem all. One by one. One by one. ",
        "Harris: How touching. ",
        "Eve: Oh -- ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: Just give me a name. Come on. ",
        "Joe: Just let it go, Gabby. ",
        "Gabriela: Why can't you tell me who Ian was in love with? ",
        "Joe: Because it doesn't matter now. ",
        "Gabriela: You're right. It doesn't matter now. What does matter is that we \r\nwere wrong, both of us. ",
        "Joe: About what? ",
        "Gabriela: Not celebrating the magic of life, what we mean to each other. ",
        "Joe: Look, Gabby, we've -- we've been through this. Okay? We've talked about \r\nthis before. ",
        "Gabriela: I want to make love with you. ",
        "Joe: And I want that, too. But until I get that last okay, waiting is the \r\nonly thing that makes sense. ",
        "Gabriela: But the sensible thing isn't always the right thing, not for the \r\nheart. And just being alive isn't living. Look, there are all kinds of \r\nprecautions that we can take. Would you just think about it? ",
        "Joe: I've thought about it. ",
        "Gabriela: And? ",
        "Joe: And if you're free for this weekend, I know this little place that we \r\ncan go. ",

        "Serena: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Here you go. ",
        "Serena: Eve gave this to me when I was really little. Remember when I was \r\nblind? I want you to have it. Her name's Ellie the Elephant and what you have to \r\ndo is you have to fall asleep with her in your arms and Eve will come and find \r\nyou in your dreams. I know she will. I promise. You just have to believe in it.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I do. Thank you. You're right. Eve will always be in my dreams. ",
        "",
        "Harris: There's nothing an Irishman loves more than telling stories. I bet \r\nhe's been telling some great ones about me. ",
        "Eve: Enough to know that life was better before I knew you existed. ",
        "Harris: Did he mention he tried to kill me? ",
        "Ian: I mentioned that I thought I had killed you. ",
        "Harris: Oh, you always hated being wrong, didn't you? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, more than you can imagine. Now what do you want? Let's get down to \r\nbusiness. That's all it is with you. It's never human value. ",
        "Harris: You tried to kill me. You failed! Now it's time to pay the penalty in \r\nhuman value. ",
        "Ian: You keep your flipping hands off her. ",
        "Eve: No -- no, Ian! Ian -- ",
        "[Ian groans] ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. ",
        "Harris: That's even beyond my willpower. Ian -- Ian, look at her. She's such \r\na beautiful woman. ",
        "Harris: I was hoping you'd want to play rough. It adds a certain kind of \r\nintensity. Don't you think? ",
        "Eve: Try it! ",
        "Harris: I intend to. But not with an audience -- not this time. ",
        "Ian: Damn you, Harris! ",
        "Harris: Get him out of here now. Come on, come on. ",
        "Eve: Ian? ",
        "Harris: If you don't crave disfigurement, I would stay right there, Doctor.\r\n",
        "Ian: I swear I will kill you before God Almighty. ",
        "Harris: Shut up! ",
        "Eve: Oh, God! ",
        "Harris: When one swears before God Almighty, failure breeds punishment as \r\nwell as contempt. Get him out of here. ",
        "Eve: Don't hurt him. Please, I'm begging you. ",
        "Harris: Begging? That sounds promising. Keep practicing, Eve. I'm coming back \r\nfor more begging, very soon. ",

        ">> On the next \"Port Charles\" -- ",
        "Alison: All I care about is being with you. ",
