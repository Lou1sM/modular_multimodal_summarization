        "Serena: I'm going to see if I can find the ornament that Christina chewed on, \r\nokay? ",
        "Lucy: That's a great idea. It's probably in the box in that back closet, \r\nokay? ",
        "Serena: Okay. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks, sweet pea. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Lucy: Oh, boy. ",
        "Chris: Lucy, hello. ",
        "Lucy: Hello. ",
        "Chris: Is Livvie here? ",
        "Lucy: No, she's not. ",
        "Chris: Okay. Do you have any idea where she might be? ",
        "Lucy: You know, she could be any number of places -- shopping, maybe the \r\nhospital, the water park this time of year's nice, I hear. ",
        "Chris: Ok, so I should just track her down on her cell phone, I guess. ",
        "Lucy: You know, you probably shouldn't even do that because she's with a \r\nfriend enjoying a pizza. And if you had any class or brains, you'd just leave \r\nher alone. ",
        "Chris: If I had any class or brains? Okay. I'll remember that. ",
        "Lucy: Good. Keep it in mind. Ta. ",
        "Chris: Pizza. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I don't want your machine, Doc! I want you. I want a real \r\nhuman voice, your voice. I don't want -- I've left a message three times. I \r\ndon't want the beep! There's the beep. Ugh! ",
        "Serena: Is something wrong with Kevin? ",
        "Lucy: No. I -- You know what happened is I thought he was going to be home by \r\nnow, and obviously I just -- I sort of misunderstood. ",
        "Serena: Something's wrong with Kevin, and you're not telling me. ",
        "",
        "Joe: What -- ",
        "Joe: Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: Go away, Joe. I'm busy. ",
        "Joe: Jeez. It looks like this place -- ",
        "Kevin: The place got hit by a bomb? Don't worry. I've barely even started \r\nyet. ",
        "Joe: What are you looking for? ",
        "Kevin: I'm looking for a reason -- I'm looking for a reason that my wife had \r\nto die. And as for you, you can either help me or get the hell out. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Well, I would call this cozy, but that'd be kind. Don't suppose it \r\nopens, huh? No, too much to hope for. ",
        "Ian: Okay. ",
        "Ian and Eve: Sorry. ",
        "Ian: Hey, why don't you pace on the other side of the bed? ",
        "Eve: You pace on the other side of the bed. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: The good news is that once we save this guy's life, we can get out of \r\nthis little resort. ",
        "Eve: And if we don't save his life, we're dead. ",
        "Ian: Try to stay positive, please. ",
        "Eve: Okay, I am positive that this guy has a very rare disease. ",
        "Ian: Chromos. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. I am also positive that finding a cure for that very rare \r\ndisease in conditions like this is damn near impossible. So you tell me that we \r\ncan save this bastard's life and make it back to Port Charles alive. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: It gets cold here in Port Charles, doesn't it? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I don't think we've seen anything yet. ",
        "Livvie: Last year at this time I was back in Arizona and everything was all \r\nwarm and sunny all the time and -- ",
        "Jack: And now it's -- ",
        "Livvie: Now I look in the mirror and I recognize my face, but I don't \r\nrecognize my life anymore. ",
        "Jack: You're cold, aren't you? I'm going to warm you up. ",
        "Livvie: I mean, I thought I had a father who my mother had loved. A father that died when I was a baby. And now I have \r\nKevin, who didn't even know I existed. Kevin tried to be so nice when Rachel -- \r\nwhen everything happened. And now that his life is totally shattered, I don't \r\nknow what to do. ",
        "Jack: Well, I bet no one could help him right now. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but he's my father. I think I should be able to comfort him \r\nsomehow. But I just -- ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey, hey -- ",
        "Livvie: I don't even where to start. ",
        "Jack: You know what? You need to give yourself a break. ",
        "Livvie: God! ",
        "Chris: Keep your hands off her! ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I realize you're very worried about Kevin, but I promise you nothing \r\nbad is going to happen to him. It's just he's very, very sad about Eve. ",
        "Serena: How can we help him? ",
        "Lucy: Well, it's hard, but, you know, for starters, we could just remind him \r\nthat no matter how awful life gets, that it does go on. So we need to show him \r\nby having our lives go on, you know, and maybe just remind him how precious \r\nevery day is. ",
        "Serena: Hey, we could make our memory ornaments. ",
        "Lucy: That's a great idea. I love traditions. That is a super idea. Let's do \r\nit. Oh, and guess what. I have already thought about what I want to put on my \r\nfirst memory ornament. Know what my most special, amazing, important memory this \r\nyear was? The day that your adoption became officially done deal, final. That \r\nwas it. ",
        "Serena: That was one of my favorites, too. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, okay, wait. Get your pen. You're going to have to write one for \r\nyourself, then, too. ",
        "Serena: Yeah. Oh -- and my second favorite was being a bridesmaid for Kevin \r\nand Eve. ",
        "Lucy: That is an absolutely wonderful memory to have. ",
        "Serena: Mom, I know you're trying to make me feel better, but I just don't \r\nfeel like laughing right now. Eve just died. Kevin's just so sad. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, look, I promise you I'm never going to ever make you believe that \r\nyou have to feel a certain way or hide something, okay? So when your heart's \r\nbreaking, like it is now, it's okay to show it. I want you to be able to do \r\nthat. But in the back of your mind, remember that hearts are good because even \r\nif they break, you can always put them back together. ",
        "Serena: I don't really think so. I haven't felt this sad since -- since \r\nChristina was taken. ",
        "Lucy: I understand. You know, I know exactly what you mean because remember \r\nit was pretty scary when I was so angry and sad? And remember I was mad and I \r\ntold that old sun, \"I dare you. You don't have the nerve to come up each and \r\nevery day and set at night. I dare you.\" Remember? ",
        "Serena: I remember. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, I guess I believed that if the world would just stop \r\nturning, then maybe I would stop hurting so much. But that's not what happened, \r\nis it? You -- you pulled me right back out of that dark place into the sunshine. You \r\nand your daddy and Kevin and Ian -- Ian. But you know what you all did? You \r\nproved I was wrong and you were right because you did pull me back into the \r\nsunshine, and I realized that I loved all of you so much. And the way to keep on \r\nhonoring the people we love is to go on laughing and living and loving them to \r\nthe best of our ability. So we have Christina in our hearts that way, don't we? \r\nAnd that's the way that Kevin is going to keep Eve with him, in his heart. ",
        "Serena: We just have to keep on reminding him. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Each and every day. Okay, you, did you happen to find the \r\nornament that Christina chewed on last year? ",
        "Serena: Yes, I did. Where is it? Oh -- oh, here it is. See it? See the little \r\nteeth marks? Can't wait to show it to Kevin. ",
        "Lucy: He'll love it. ",
        "",
        "Joe: You know, the police already did a pretty thorough search of this place.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, they don't know what they're looking for, now, do they? \r\nNobody does. But somebody did this -- made a choice to kill Ian and my wife. And \r\nI'm going to find them. And when I do, I'm going to tear them apart one limb at \r\na time. ",
        "Joe: Kevin, what makes you think that there'd be any clues here in Ian's \r\napartment? ",
        "Kevin: Because Mac told me the explosion was done by professionals. And I \r\njust don't believe that anyone would want to kill Eve. That leaves your friend, \r\nIan Thornhart. All I have to do is find his enemies. ",
        "Joe: Look, Ian knew a lot of people, all over the world. That's a lot of \r\nlooking. ",
        "Kevin: Don't think I can't do this, Joe. ",
        "Joe: Kevin, just -- that looks like Ian's writing. ",
        "Kevin: \"Dear Eve, from the moment we kissed --\" ",
        "Kevin: \"From the moment we kissed --\" ",
        "Joe: Look, I'm sure that that's just -- that's a mistake, all right? Just \r\nfinish it. ",
        "Kevin: It is finished. There is no more. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I'm right, aren't I? We're never getting out of here. ",
        "Ian: I didn't say that. ",
        "Eve: You don't have to. We're never going home. I'm never going to see my \r\nhusband again. We're sitting in our tomb. ",
        "Ian: Never took you for a quitter. ",
        "Eve: I -- fine. You tell me how we get out of here. Tell me how we get out!\r\n",
        "Ian: Harris believes we're his only chance at life, that's how. ",
        "Eve: We could find a cure, save his life, and he would still kill us. ",
        "Ian: You're forgetting something. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Me. I'm not going to let you get hurt. I got you into this, I'll get you \r\nout. You have to know that. ",
        "Eve: I do. I believe you. ",
        "",
        "Chris: I told you to stay away from her. ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Chris: Guy's working an angle, Livvie. You can spot it a mile away. ",
        "Jack: Shut the hell up, man. You don't even know me. ",
        "Chris: You want to take your best shot, that's fine with me, but you leave \r\nher out of it. ",
        "Jack: You're not even worth it. ",
        "Lou: Hey, hey, break it up! ",
        "Livvie: Guys, stop it! Both of you, stop it! ",
        "Jack: Give me that. ",

        "Kevin: Eve and Ian -- ",
        "Joe: Kevin. It's an unfinished note. Don't read anything into it. ",
        "Kevin: I don't have to! It's all right here! ",
        "Joe: Well, look around, Kevin. Ian was leaving town, all right? If there was \r\never anything -- and I mean if -- it wasn't going anywhere. ",
        "Kevin: You're holding out on me. Do you know anything about this? ",
        "Joe: No. No, I don't. ",
        "Kevin: I know how to spot a bad liar, Joe. ",
        "Joe: All right, look, I'll tell you what I know. But it's not much. I think \r\n-- I think Ian had feelings for Eve. But he knew she loved you, right? He knew \r\nand there was nowhere for it to go. No place for him. ",
        "Kevin: What about this -- this kiss? Do you know anything about that, Joe?\r\n",
        "Joe: No. ",
        "Kevin: Well, there's a lot not to know, isn't there, Joe? Like what happened \r\nafter the kiss. Was there an affair? Were they in love with each other? Were \r\nthey making plans? Is that why they were in the car together? ",
        "Joe: All right, look, you've got no reason to suspect anything. You two loved \r\neach other, right? You were happy together. It'd be different if you were having \r\nproblems, but -- no, I don't believe it. ",
        "Kevin: Isn't it funny how people can fool you, Joe? ",

        "Ian: I meant what I said. I'm not going to let him hurt you. ",
        "Eve: I got to get cleaned up. ",
        "Ian: Well, look at that. At least Harris left some clean clothes. ",
        "Eve: Wonderful. Thanks. Not quite used to these close quarters. ",
        "Ian: Well, you're doing okay, considering. ",
        "Eve: Considering what? ",
        "Ian: You're with me. I can be a real pain sometimes. ",

        "Ian: Tomorrow I should see what kind of a lab he's got set up for us, see if \r\nwe can work with it. ",
        "Eve: Hey, I've got an idea. What about we treat him with rat poison? ",
        "[Eve laughs] ",
        "Eve: Well, actually, on second thought, he probably drinks that for breakfast \r\nin the mornings, so never mind. Ian? ",
        "Ian: Sorry -- just thinking about stuff. ",

        "Livvie: Please! Stop it! Both of you! You just give him his picture back! ",
        "Chris: It's not his picture! It's mine! This is a picture of me and my kid \r\nbrother. So you want to tell me what you're doing with it? ",
        "Jack: It's me. ",

        "Ian: Hmm. ",
        "Eve: But let's just flip for it, how's that? ",
        "Ian: No, it's all right. When I was in El Salvador I slept on a floor -- ",
        "Eve: Ok, please, save the war stories, okay? I got it. ",
        "Ian: All right. Okay. ",
        "Eve: All right, hold on, this is driving me nuts. Look, ahem -- we both have \r\nto be on our game to try and plan a cure for Harris tomorrow, so why don't I \r\nsleep underneath the covers and you just sleep on top of the covers? ",
        "Ian: You sure? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. We're both adults, right? ",

        "Kevin: That's for you, my sweet. Just a little shrine to our perfect love. \r\nYou remember that wine auction we went to? 1982 Mouton Rothschild. Promised to \r\nsave it for a special occasion. Even though I'm not much for red wine anymore. \r\nSorry you never had a chance to enjoy it. ",
        "Kevin: It's a little thin. Guess we shouldn't have waited. Just goes to show \r\nyou -- don't put off the things that give you pleasure. Apparently, you already \r\nknew that. ",
