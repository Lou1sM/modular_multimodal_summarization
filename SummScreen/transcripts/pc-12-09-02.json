        "Alison: I don't even believe \r\nwhat I'm hearing. Please tell me you didn't do this. Please tell me you did not \r\nactually crawl inside my head and give me this nightmare of Stephen being Caleb. \r\nPlease tell me this, rafe.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. ",
        "Alison: I dreamt that he bit me \r\nand that he killed me. ",
        "Rafe: I know. I'm sorry. \r\nSomething went wrong. It wasn't supposed to happen this way. The dream -- that \r\nwas supposed to help you. ",
        "Alison: How, by scaring me half \r\nto death? ",
        "Rafe: No, I just wanted you to \r\nsee -- I wanted you to see who Caleb is. He's -- he's not your friend. That is \r\nCaleb. He's not Stephen, ok? ",
        "Alison: So -- so let me get \r\nthis straight. You put some sort of spell on me. ",
        "Rafe: No -- ",
        "Alison: You put some sort of \r\nspell on me with your magical powers that I thought you didn't have anymore.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: No, I don't -- I don't! \r\nAt least most of the time. ",
        "Alison: What does that mean?\r\n",
        "Rafe: I don't know. I can't \r\nreally explain it, but it seems like when it comes to you -- ",
        "Alison: What about when it \r\ncomes to me? What? ",
        "Rafe: It -- it seems like when \r\n-- when it comes to you, when I have really strong feelings, you know, like love \r\nor concern or anything like that -- when they're really strong, I can tap into \r\nit. I can tap into the magic. And I thought it was just a fluke at first. I \r\nturned a yellow rose into a pink one without even trying. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Rafe: And then when your father \r\ndied, I -- I told you I --\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Yeah, I dreamt of him \r\nin that way and that was all because -- because of you. Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: You were so upset, and I \r\njust -- I wanted to be there for you and I wanted to make you feel better, and \r\nit worked. But this time -- ",
        "Alison: What, you thought maybe \r\nI needed some sort of wake-up call or what? ",
        "Rafe: No, I just wanted you to \r\nsee Stephen like I do. He is Caleb, and I need you to stay away from him! \n",
        "Alison: And you think that that \r\nmakes everything ok, by manipulating me? I can't wait to see what happens when \r\ndown the road you and I get into a disagreement. Are you going to crawl back \r\ninside my head and make sure that I see things the way you do?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: No. No -- ",
        "Alison: Yeah, \"no\" is right \r\nbecause that is brainwashing and controlling. And I'm sorry, but if that is the \r\nway our future looks, I don't want any part of it. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I have to stop it. I have \r\n-- I've got to stop thinking about him. I've got to stop worrying about Ian. \r\nHe'll be fine. He's going to get through this. He's going to get over everything \r\n-- over me and move on. That's the way it has to be because I am putting my life \r\nback together with Kevin. That's all there is to it. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Lucy: Doc? Kevin? Doc? That's \r\nfunny. I really thought he should be home by now.\r\n\n",

        "Woman: Hey, love, looking for a \r\ndate? ",
        "Kevin: As a matter of fact, I \r\nam. A date that's long overdue. ",
        "Woman: No! No, no! Mister, we \r\ncan work this out! Please! ",
        "Kevin: Quiet! ",
        "Woman: Please, please, don't \r\nhurt me again! ",
        "Please! ",
        "Kevin: Quiet. ",
        "Woman: I'm begging you! \n",
        "Kevin: Quiet! Shut up. \n",
        "Woman: Let me go! Let me go.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I can't do that. \n",
        "Woman: Let me go. ",
        "Kevin: I can't do that. You \r\nsee, I'm just getting my life back together, and going to jail -- well, that \r\ndoesn't fit into my plans.\r\n\n",

        "Livvie: What's the matter, \r\nStephen? Come on, this can't be the first time a big rock star like you has come \r\nhome to find a naked woman in his bed. ",
        "Stephen: You are full of \r\nsurprises, aren't you? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I'm just one big \r\nsurprise after another, so why don't you join me and I'll show you. ",
        "Stephen: Look, Livvie -- \n",
        "Livvie: No, no. Please, don't \r\ncall me that. Call me what you always have, what you called me earlier. The \r\nminute you said it, that's when I knew it was you, Caleb. Call me Olivia. Your \r\nsweet Olivia. ",

        "Alison: No -- ",
        "Rafe: Please -- ",
        "Alison: No, Rafe, you -- you \r\nneed to listen to me. This obsession that you have with Stephen being Caleb has \r\ngot you so turned around, you can't even see how insane your behavior is. \r\nThere's nothing that can justify what you did. ",
        "Rafe: I know. I know that now, \r\nall right? I -- I'd rather cut off my arm than put you through that nightmare, \r\nok? I would! ",
        "Alison: I'm not just talking \r\nabout the nightmare! ",
        "Rafe: What do you mean, then?\r\n",
        "Alison: Don't you remember the \r\npromise that you made to me the night that you came back to me on that train? Do \r\nyou remember? You told me that we were through with the magic. We were just \r\ngoing to put it aside and you and I were going to be a normal couple, like \r\nnormal people. We were going to do normal things. Do you remember that? Do you \r\nremember that promise?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Alison: Good, because I do, \r\ntoo, and I cherish that promise because it's -- it's about everything that we're \r\nworking towards -- our future, our life together, our marriage. And now I feel \r\nlike the whole thing has just crumbled into a thousand pieces and all I'm left \r\nwith is a bunch of chaotic images of Caleb that my own fiance put into my brain.\r\n",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. ",
        "Alison: I don't want you to be \r\nsorry. I just want you to tell me because I honestly -- I don't know. How do you \r\nand I move on? How do you and I ever have \"normal\"? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: I knew it. I knew you \r\nwouldn't be able to resist me any more than you can go on denying your love for \r\nme. Don't stop, my darling. Please don't stop.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Tell me why you want \r\nthis. ",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Stephen: You tried to kill me. \r\nWhy do you want me back now? ",
        "Livvie: Because I know now. I \r\nfinally realize -- ",
        "Stephen: Realize what? \n",
        "Livvie: That you're the only \r\nman who's ever truly loved me for who I am, who accepts me good, bad, and no \r\nmatter what. ",
        "Stephen: You betrayed me. You \r\ndestroyed me. I can't forget that. I won't forget it. ",
        "Livvie: No, Caleb. Please, \r\nwait, please. I need you. I need things to be the way they once were. \n",
        "Stephen: It's not possible. \r\nThey can never be the way they were.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Yes, it can. Come on. \r\nWith you, anything is possible. Just tell me -- what do I have to do to win your \r\nlove again, to have you back completely? ",

And -- oh, I bet \r\nhe's going to be starving when he comes home. I will order takeout from that \r\nlittle Italian restaurant he likes. You know, I have a menu in here somewhere. I \r\nknow I do. I got -- oh, goodness' sake. I got one. What, what -- what am I \r\ndoing? I'm acting silly. That's what I'm doing. This is ridiculous. This is not \r\nlike a first date. This is my husband coming home, and everything's going to be \r\njust fine. If I want things to get better, I can't force it. I just have to let \r\nit happen. If we're going to get together, then it --\r\n\n",

        "Kevin: Yeah, and you sure did. \r\nThe place looks great. ",
        "Lucy: Good. Thanks. ",
        "So, where were you? Spent all \r\nthis time with Victor, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Most of it, yeah, and \r\nthe rest of the time I was tying up some loose ends. ",
        "Lucy: \"Loose ends\"? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, things don't look \r\nvery good. I mean, Victor's tried, but --\r\n\n",

        "Lucy: Ok, I'll try. I'm trying. \r\nIt's just I want to do something. You know me -- I got to do something, and I \r\njust wish I could go to the woman and say, \"Look, you don't understand. When \r\nKevin attacked you like that, it was because he wasn't himself,\" that you're all \r\nbetter now. ",
        "Kevin: But the fact is I did \r\nhurt her, Lucy. And I have to pay for that, one way or the other. ",
        "Lucy: Then I guess what we will \r\ndo is just hope for some sort of miracle, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Whatever happens, I love \r\nyou. Don't ever forget that, ok?\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Of course not. Doc, what \r\n-- what happened? Your wrist -- it's all scratched. What -- how did you get \r\nthose? ",

        "Kevin: I don't know! I'm sorry, \r\nI'm -- I'm sorry, Lucy. It's just been a very difficult day. ",
        "Lucy: Why -- why don't I get \r\nsome antiseptic and I'll clean that up. It looks pretty bad. ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no. Actually, \r\nthere's something -- something I want to say. ",

        "Lucy: You're my husband, I am \r\nyour wife, and I love you. And all I want out of any of this is just to get our \r\nlives back. I want it to be like it was before all this happened. ",

And you're right \r\nabout something else. You know, if we're going to have a future together, if \r\nwe're going to have a life together, then the last thing I want is for you to be \r\nscared and worried every time you close your eyes and go to sleep. And you're \r\nnot going to have to be, I promise, because what happened today will never \r\nhappen again.\r\n\n",

        "Livvie: Ever since you came \r\nback to Port Charles, I've been hit with all these memories of what it was like \r\nto be with you. I tried fighting them, fighting the constant pull to you that \r\nevery day would just get stronger and stronger. But I couldn't. And I still \r\ncan't. Caleb, you told me that love in this world is fleeting and temporary but \r\nyour love was infinite and forever. So if that is true, then it must also be \r\ntrue that you still love me, that you still long for me the way I long for you. \r\nSo I am begging you, take me. Make me your bride again, and I will never, ever \r\nbetray you again.\r\n\n",

        "Victor: All she told the police \r\nwas that she wanted to put this behind her, get on with her life. As a matter of \r\nfact, she's leaving Port Charles tonight for good.\r\n\n",
