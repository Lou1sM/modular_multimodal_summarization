        "Rafe: Well, I am desperate! I \r\nmean, look at me. I went and got my hair cut, shaved my beard. I mean, obviously \r\nthat's not going to work. I need some advice.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Well, my advice is you \r\nlook really good. No, wait, wait -- what do you mean you want advice from me, \r\nwho -- I live through my vibes, I talk to the universe. I talk to my pet duck. I \r\nhave a pet duck. ",

        "Lucy: Stephen is really Caleb.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Exactly, exactly. I \r\nwanted her to see that, fangs and all. So -- so I put them together in her \r\ndream, and it just kind of got out of hand. And in the dream, Caleb killed \r\nAlison.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Oops. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, \"oops.\" How could I \r\nhave done something so stupid? ",
        "Lucy: Well -- well, because -- \r\nbecause that's what you're used to doing. I mean, you know, you once did live \r\nthat existence -- ",

        "Lucy: Well, I know that your \r\nheart was in the right place, right? ",
        "Rafe: It doesn't matter. It \r\ndoesn't matter. Alison doesn't want to be with somebody who's waving around \r\nmagic wands. She just wants -- ",

        "Marissa: No. No, no, no, no, \r\nthat's not what this is about. This is not about ego. This is about being heard. \r\nThis is about counting for something, making your mark in this world.
