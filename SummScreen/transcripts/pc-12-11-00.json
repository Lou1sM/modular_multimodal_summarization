        "Livvie: Please, Chris, just give him his picture back. ",
        "Chris: It's not his picture. It's mine. It's a picture of me and my kid \r\nbrother, so you want to tell me what you're doing with it?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'll tell you. It's me. ",
        "Chris: What? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's me and my brother. ",
        "Chris: You -- you're -- ",
        "Jack: Yeah, Jack, yeah. I don't believe this. ",
        "Chris: Neither do I. ",
        "Livvie: What, you didn't have any clue? ",
        "Jack: You think I'm lying? ",
        "Livvie: Jack, I don't know. I mean -- you kept asking so many questions about \r\nChris. ",
        "Chris: Questions? What kind of -- what? About my finances? Huh? Because I have \r\na lot of money. It's no secret. And there are a lot of people who'd like to get \r\ntheir hands on it. ",
        "Jack: Peanut butter and banana sandwiches. You remember that, Chris? You used \r\nto make those for us every night -- when Dad was too blitzed and Mom couldn't \r\nget out of bed. Saturday morning cartoons. You remember Saturday morning \r\ncartoons? You used to watch those with me every Saturday morning until our old \r\nman took the TV away to pay off his bookie. ",
        "Chris: Anybody could find that out. ",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah? What about this? Hmm? ",
        "Chris: Where did you get that? ",
        "Jack: From you on my fifth birthday, Chris. You sold your Mark McGuire rookie card for it. It wasn't worth \r\nmuch then, but the point is it was your favorite card. But you know what was \r\nspecial about this was my name. Right there. Now, you took a kitchen knife and \r\ncarved it in there so that I knew that it would be mine. ",
        "Chris: Nobody knew that. ",
        "Jack: Only your brother. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian? ",
        "Ian: Hmm? ",
        "Eve: Before Harris' men grabbed us, when we were in your car -- ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm? ",
        "Eve: You said that you had something to tell me, something that was \r\nimportant. ",
        "Ian: That was a long time ago. ",
        "Eve: What was it? What were you going to say? ",
        "Eve: I want an answer. ",
        "Ian: It's late. Let's talk about it in the morning. ",
        "Eve: No. No. Let's talk about it right now. I was on my way to the hospital \r\nwhen I saw you outside and I asked you why you were leaving Port Charles. And \r\nnow all of a sudden I find myself being held prisoner by some lunatic who has a \r\nvendetta against you. The least you could do is tell me what it is you were \r\ngoing to say. Damn it, Ian, don't you think I deserve the truth? ",
        "Ian: All right, you want the truth? I'll tell you. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Answer the phone, Kevin. Answer the phone. Just pick up the phone! Pick \r\nit up! Oh, my -- gosh, I know something's wrong. I just -- I know it. Keys. \r\nKeys, keys, keys. Where are my keys? Keys -- keys, keys, keys -- oh, damn \r\nyou, Doc! ",
        "Lucy: Hmm, hmm, hmm. There you are. Thank you, God -- Goddess. Goddess, God \r\n-- thank you, whoever you are. Thank you. All right, Doc, here I come. ",

        "Livvie: Chris, it really does look like Jack's your brother. Aren't you going \r\nto say anything? ",
        "Chris: How'd you find me? ",
        "Jack: I didn't. I didn't even know it was you. ",
        "Chris: What, you're telling me this is just a big coincidence? ",
        "Jack: Hey, man, I'm just as blown away as you are. I mean, here all along \r\nI've been bumping into my own -- ",
        "Chris: More like bumping up against him. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, but if I'd have known, then -- I mean, look, we're brothers, man.\r\n",
        "Chris: Brothers. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. And I guess I don't have to ask how you've been. I mean -- yeah, \r\nlooks like you're doing great -- you know, doctor and all. ",
        "Chris: How about you? ",
        "Jack: Okay. After I got out of the foster homes. Hey, man, it's not your fault \r\nDad dumped me there. Then Mom found me. ",
        "Chris: Mom? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, she didn't die like the old man said. ",
        "Chris: So you've been living with her? ",
        "Jack: Up until a little while ago. See, when Mom found me, she was sick. She \r\nwas dying. Except for real this time. ",
        "Livvie: God, that must have been so hard for you. ",
        "Jack: And then I heard about this treatment. You know, that would've helped her \r\na lot, but we didn't have any money or any insurance. I mean, good luck trying \r\nto find a doctor when you have none of that stuff. So, I looked around and I got \r\nher into this free clinic. But by that time it was too late. ",
        "Chris: Then she's gone? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah. She's gone. ",
        "Livvie: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Chris: It was a shame you didn't find me sooner. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, we looked. But, you know, I mean, Mom, she got so sick that \r\nshe couldn't travel. But -- but, hey. You know what? I wish she could see us \r\nnow. I mean, you don't know how happy this would make her. ",
        "Chris: So -- you didn't come looking for me. You just -- came to Port \r\nCharles. How did you get here? Why? ",
        "Jack: I don't know. I just kind of been drifting around. ",
        "Chris: Just sort of drifted here. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Or maybe it's fate. ",
        "Chris: Fate. Yeah, maybe it is. Because I believe in fate. Just not this \r\ntime. ",
        "",
        "Eve: I'm not going anywhere. ",
        "Ian: What difference does it make what I say? ",
        "Eve: I already told you. ",
        "Ian: Okay. Okay. It's a computer disk with all of Rachel's research on it -- \r\nI thought you should have it. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. And all the notes that we took when we were trying to save Lucy. I \r\nwanted to get it to you. ",
        "Eve: All this is over some stupid computer disk? ",
        "Ian: Yep. What did you think it was about? ",
        "Eve: Anything but that. I already told you I made a copy of that computer \r\ndisk. ",
        "Ian: Oh, no, that's right, you did. Must've forgot with all the packing going \r\non and all that, but, well, it's a good thing because I don't think my disk \r\nsurvived the bomb blast. ",
        "Eve: I can't believe this. ",
        "Ian: Can't believe what? ",
        "Eve: You said that this was serious. ",
        "Ian: It is serious. What if somebody else comes in with the same symptoms, \r\nI'm not here, and you didn't have the treatment for them? ",
        "Eve: Ian, you know what I'm talking about. ",
        "Ian: I don't have a clue. ",
        "Eve: That night at the Recovery Room when I went outside to ask you why you \r\nwere leaving, I had a feeling that you were just about to tell me -- ",
        "Ian: I did tell you. I was leaving to find a new life for myself, a new \r\nbeginning, with new challenges. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, and you were going to tell me the real reason. What's the real \r\nreason? ",
        "Ian: That's it! That's it. Good night. ",
        "Eve: For God's sake, Ian, we almost died! My friends and family, the people I \r\nlove, my husband included, thinks that we're dead! We still could be. And for \r\nwhat? For what? For nothing! ",

        "Kevin: Yeah! Let it all burn! ",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, you're just drunk. You're drunk. That's why you're saying \r\nthat. Please come with me, Doc. You got to -- you got to come with me. Oh, my \r\nGod. Oh, my God. Doc -- oh -- oh, my -- ",

        "Jack: Finally run into your long lost brother and you think it's a scam. \r\nThat's sad, man. ",
        "Chris: You know something? I could almost buy it -- the idea that we're \r\ncoincidentally in the same place. But with the same girl? I don't think so. It's \r\na little too convenient. You can see that, can't you, Livvie? ",
        "Livvie: What I see are two brothers who are a lot alike, and maybe it wasn't \r\neither of you who found me. Maybe it was me who found something in the both of \r\nyou, something that was the same because you are so much alike. ",
        "Chris: The same? The same? He's nothing but a con artist. I knew it \r\nthe minute I saw him, before I even knew who he was. He's after something. I \r\njust don't know what it is yet. ",
        "Jack: You know, I take it back, about what I said before -- wishing Mom could \r\nsee us. All she wanted, Chris, was to find you. That's all she talked about at \r\nthe end -- was being a family again. But this? No. No, this would've broke her \r\nheart. ",

        "Eve: Why did you even come to the Recovery Room that night? You must've known \r\nthat I would be there with my husband and my friends. How could you even think \r\nto barge in on it? ",

        "Eve: All for some stupid computer disk. ",
        "Ian: I was -- ",

        "Ian: If I could -- ",
        "Eve: God, when I think of what my friends and my family are going through \r\nright now, when I think of what this is doing to Kevin -- what I would do if it \r\nwere -- you know what? I've had a hard life. But I managed to pick myself up and \r\nbecome a doctor and marry the most wonderful, caring man I've ever met, the kind \r\nof man that I would never have thought could love me. ",
        "Ian: Don't sell yourself short there, Lambert. ",
        "Eve: Oh, I don't. I don't because of Kevin. Because he made me believe that I \r\nwas special. And I must've been to have someone like that love me. And now I \r\ncould lose it, all of it, everything that's important to me because of you \r\nand some stupid computer disk! ",
        "Ian: If I could do it over again, I swear -- ",
        "Eve: Oh, I don't want to hear it, okay? I don't even want to hear it. You \r\nwere right when you said you were going to leave G.H. without saying goodbye. I \r\nwish you had just kept on going! What the heck is wrong with you? ",

        "Frank: It's a good thing you showed up when you did. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, we have sort of this uncanny ability to show up and help each \r\nother out when we most need it. It's just -- this was different this time, \r\nFrank. It was kind of weird because he didn't really want my help. He didn't \r\nwant me to get him out of there. ",
