        "Livvie: Please, Chris, just give him his picture back. ",
        "Chris: It's not his picture. It's mine. It's a picture of me and my kid \r\nbrother. So you want to tell me what you're doing with it? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'll tell you. It's me. ",
        "Chris: What? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's me and my brother. ",
        "Chris: He's after something. I just don't know what it is yet. ",
        "Jack: You finally run into your long-lost brother, and you think it's a scam. \r\nThat's sad, man. ",
        "Chris: You know something? I could almost buy it, the idea that we're \r\ncoincidentally in the same place. But with the same girl? I don't think so. It's \r\na little too convenient. You can see that, can't you, Livvie? ",

        "Ian: Okay. Okay. It's a computer disk with all of Rachel's research on it. I \r\nthought you should have it. ",
        "Eve: Why did you even come to the Recovery Room that night? You must have \r\nknown that I would be there with my husband and my friends. How could you even \r\nthink to barge in on it -- ",
        "Ian: Eve, I was leaving it. ",
        "Eve: All for some stupid computer disk? ",
        "Ian: I was -- ",
        "Eve: You could have mailed it. You could have left it at G.H., anything. But, \r\nno, you had to come deliver it in person so I could get in the car with you and \r\nblow up. ",
        "Ian: That's enough! I know you want this to be my fault, I understand that, \r\nbut maybe it isn't. ",
        "Eve: You think this is my fault? ",
        "Ian: I came looking for you. That's all I did. I was looking for you, and I \r\nsaw you through the window with your husband, and I didn't want to interrupt, so \r\nI left. You came after me, so you tell me why. ",

        "Chris: Hey. Look, I'm sorry if I came on a little strong. I guess we have a \r\nlot to talk about, so, why don't you come back to my place and sit down and \r\ncatch up? ",

        "Lucy: I'm talking about this. ",
        "Kevin: Where did you get that? ",
        "Lucy: It was in your jacket. I was just trying to brush some of the soot off. \r\nDoc, I wasn't snooping. It just sort of popped out of the pocket. ",
        "Kevin: Sure, it did. ",
        "Lucy: It did. This is what this is all about, isn't it? This is why you \r\ndidn't want to come out of the fire, isn't it, Doc? ",
        "Kevin: The whole time she said she was working with Ian. I'm an idiot, Lucy.\r\n",
        "Lucy: You're not. Maybe you're reading a lot more into this than there was.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No, I'm not. They kissed. It says so right here. Maybe she was in that \r\ncar because they were planning to go away together. ",
        "Lucy: No, no. That's not a possibility. ",
        "Kevin: And you said yourself you saw them together. Did you know, Lucy? Did \r\nyou have any idea this was going on? ",
        "Lucy: I knew that you and Eve were having trouble, and, Doc, I also know that \r\nshe loved you very much -- you and only you. ",

        "Alison: Your Jack -- who's actually our Jack, who's my Chandler -- is Chris \r\nRamsey's brother? ",
        "Livvie: Except I just wish that the two of them could get along because I \r\njust like them both so much. ",
        "Alison: Because they're both, you know -- both pretty hot. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, Chris and Jack are both cute. That's the easy part. ",
        "Alison: Okay, so how did you guys hook up in the first place? What, your face \r\nis turning red. What is that? ",
        "Livvie: I didn't know he was in the river, and he didn't know I was on the \r\nshore, and when he came out of the water, he was totally naked. ",
        "Alison: What? Oh, my God! Shut up. Are you serious? ",
        "Livvie: It's not like I saw anything. I mean, I just -- I closed my eyes and \r\nturned away, and all I wanted to do was run. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, like towards him. But you didn't, did you? ",
        "Livvie: No, I didn't. He was so sweet and -- ",

        "Alison: No, you don't have to because Jamal and I have the same thing, so I \r\ntotally understand what you're talking about. ",
        "Livvie: But, on the other hand, Chris is, like, totally freaked out. He \r\ndoesn't trust Jack at all. ",
        "Alison: But they're brothers. ",
        "Livvie: Well, they don't act like it. I mean, I'm an only child, and I always \r\nthought having a brother or sister meant having someone you can count on \r\nforever. ",

        "Jack: You know, all those years I always wondered what it would be like when \r\nwe finally came back together again. Got to tell you, it was nothing like this.\r\n",
        "Chris: Sorry to disappoint you. ",
        "Jack: You don't give a rat's ass. You made that clear from the moment you saw \r\nme and you didn't recognize who I was. And you still don't know me. ",
        "Chris: You're a small-town punk hustler who's just working an angle. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I used to. And that's how I got through. And then Mom and I found \r\neach other again and we became a part of something, a family, and that changed \r\neverything. That's all she wanted for us, was to \"find your brother.\" \r\nThat was her \r\ndying wish -- was \"Find your brother. Be a family again.\" Well, here I am, \r\nChris. Now it's your move. ",

No. I can't handle it, okay? ",

        "Chris: It's in our genes, Jack. Trust no one. ",
