Get out of karen's life, she lives. You don't, she dies. ", "Frank: You actually think by getting rid of me, karen will fall in love with you? ", "Chris: She's already falling in love with me, frank. ", "Frank: You're crazy. ", "Chris: And you're a distraction that neither of us need. So what is it going to be? ", "Rafe: No, no, don't do it, frank! ", "Frank: I'll back off. ", "Chris: What's that? ", "Frank: I said i'll back off. ", "Chris: Good choice. ", "Rafe: Oh. When is this going to get easier? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: What's going on? ", "Eve: Hey, thornhart, get your coat and hat. We're going on a family outing. I thought we'd take danny on his very first sleigh ride. ", "Ian: Eve, i've -- ", "eve: Yeah, come on, it's my turn, thornhart. After the gesture you made with the christmas tree, you know, it's my turn. I want to do something. That's what the holidays are all about, right? ", "Ian: Right. ", "Eve: And you said we should be celebrating. And we should be celebrating the fact that things are finally back to normal. ", "Ian: Hang on a second. I appreciate what you're trying to do here, and I'm trying very hard to find the christmas spirit. But you can't possibly think that things are back to normal. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: Oh, my, goodness! This is perfect. Look at this. Don! Don, these little pompons match that suit I bought for my trousseau perfectly. Don, get over here! Look at these pompons! These are great! ", "Don: For the love of vogue, have mercy. ", "Lucy: What, do you think i've gone a little overboard? ", "Don: Oh, oh, is that my back breaking? ", "Lucy: Well, maybe. I mean, I'm not supposed to know that my wedding's back on. I have to be nonchalant, casual, right? ", "Don: Exactly. ", "Lucy: Right. But you know what? I tend to go overboard for just regular parties, right? ", "Don: Oh, no, no. No, please, don'T. ", "Lucy: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, but I have to handle myself calmly, cooly, be nonchalant. I can do it, but it's going to be hard. ", "Don: Yeah. ", "Lucy: Oh, don, doc is just being so darn cute with this. Don't you think it's cute and so romantic? ", "Don: Yeah, well, I'm going to sit down now. ", "Lucy: Good idea, don. There's a little bench right in that corner, right over there. ", "Don: Oh, thanks. ", "Lucy: But doc is being very sneaky, really, but it is so romantic. I saw that scarf first. I saw it. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Phone rings] ", "kevin: Hello. Actually, I was just on my way to see you. I just had to make a stop first. Well, I just wanted to stop and pick up something for you. Yes, i know I don't have to, but it's the least i can do for you since everything you've done for me coming back here. I'll be there soon. Ok. Oh, miss? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Clerk: Yes.

", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "eve: I know that our marriage is strained, but i thought that when you changed your mind about the christmas tree that that was your way of saying that you were ready to move on. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: I want to get past this as much as you do, but it's going to take a little more than waving a magic wand and buying a christmas tree. There's a lot of damage been done in both camps, and we can't pretend it didn't happen. ", "Eve: Ok. ", "Ian: Well, here it goes. I'm -- i'm having a hard time getting -- getting past the fact that you believed all those lies about me, and I'm having a hard time knowing that I broke your trust in me when I went and found comfort in another woman's arms. Now, are you saying that you can forgive me for that? ", "Eve: I'm trying. I really am. In fact, that's where I went last night when I left here. ", "Ian: You went where? You went to see lucy? ", "Eve: Yeah, I did because lucy and kevin are having this big christmas party, and i wanted to go over there in person and tell her exactly where she could stick her invitation. I -- i guess i'm not as over it as i thought i was, right?", "Ian: So much for the christmas spirit. ", "Eve: Well, she did say something that actually made me think about some things. ", "Ian: What's that? ", "Eve: She told me that i should take a look in the mirror and accept some of the responsibility for what happened. I mean, I've been going through the motions with you and i've been saying some of the words, but I haven't said the words that are the most important. I haven't said that I'm sorry. ", "Ian: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you. A lot of time to get to this place, didn't it? And it's going to take a lot of time to get back, but, god willing, we have it. But for now, what do you say we take a curious little boy on his first sleigh ride? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Karen: Hey. I thought you'd be long gone by now. ", "Chris: Well, I wanted to stick around and see how you were reacting to the medication. ", "Karen: Better, definitely, but nowhere near 100%. ", "Chris: Well, we will get you to 100% in no time, and I am going to stay here by your side to make sure of it. ", "Karen: No, you don't have to do that. I've got frank to take care of me now.", "Rafe: No. Don't push her away, man. You may think you're doing the right thing, but you're not. You can hold on to her. Trust that, come on. ", "Frank: Yeah, actually, chris really should be the one taking care of you. ", "Karen: What? ", "Frank: Well, you need a doctor around who knows exactly what's going on with you. ", "Karen: Yeah, and he'll be coming by regularly to check up on me. I thought that was the plan. You don't have to be here around the clock. ", "Chris: Well, not necessarily, but I think someone should be here all the time just to make sure. ", "Karen: Right. Frank. You said you could take time off work, right? ", "Frank: Yeah, I can. Actually, I did, but for a different reason. ", "Karen: What are you talking about? ", "Frank: I'm not going to be around, karen. ", "Rafe: No! Tell her the truth! Don't let her think you don't care! ", "Karen: You're not going to be around? Where are you going? ", "Frank: Well, when we were broken up, i made plans to take a trip with neil to visit joe, and I don't want to disappoint him and not go. ", "Karen: How long will you be gone? ", "Frank: I don't know. It could be a while. ", "Karen: You found out yesterday that i was dying. I may be recovering, but i know you wouldn't leave right now. ", "Frank: Chris says you're out of the woods. ", "Karen: You didn't postpone your trip till you were sure. I know you. Something else is going on here, and I want to know what it is and I want the truth. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: So who is that lucky lady in your life? ", "Kevin: I was going to surprise you for christmas. ", "Lucy: Oh, doc, you know me so well. I was just looking at that exact same scarf. ", "Kevin: How about that? Well, what do you know? ", "Lucy: And, you know, this -- I couldn't even be more surprised, actually, because not just the fact that i was looking at the same scarf, but i'm really surprised that you're doing your christmas shopping for me so early. You don't usually do that. ", "Kevin: Well, I wasn't. I -- i haven't, but -- well, I was here and -- you know -- ", "lucy: Yeah. ", "Kevin: Yeah, yeah. ", "Clerk: Here you go, sir. ", "Kevin: Oh, thank you so much. Thank you very much. Well, merry christmas. ", "Lucy: Oh, doc, thank you. I cannot tell you how much this means to me. Oh.", "Don: Lucy, are we done shopping for your wedding yet? ", "Lucy: Don, you're just such a big kidder. One of our employees is getting married, you. Ha-ha, and he's just kidding me that i'm doing so much for her that it's almost like it was my own wedding. Isn't that right? You know, I think you're so funny you could do standup. ", "Kevin: Must be some employee. ", "Lucy: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. What, don, she's been with us for several weeks -- years. ", "Don: Years. ", "Lucy: Years. She's been with us for several years, and i just can't do enough for her. Don, perhaps you need to -- scram -- go. Oh, gosh, wait, here, yes. Ok, here you go. Oopsy-daisy. Off you go. ", "Don: Thanks. ", "Lucy: Thank you. ", "Don: Uh-huh. ", "Lucy: So, where were we? ", "Kevin: I don't know. ", "Lucy: Oh. I know. I was just going to ask you if maybe we could get together to talk later. ", "Kevin: Today? Oh, no, not today. I have a patient. Maybe tomorrow. ", "Lucy: Is everything ok? ", "Kevin: Yeah, sure. Why? ", "Lucy: No reason. You just seem a little different. ", "Kevin: I'm tired. Maybe that's what it is. ", "Lucy: Oh. Well, you know, last night, I did try and call you several times, and you weren't home. Why weren't you at -- I'm not asking you that. Hmm, hmm, I'm taking it back inside. I'm erasing that. I didn't mean to sound like a woman who was checking up on somebody, which is as far from the truth as it could be.", "Kevin: Lucy, it's ok. I was working late. That's why i'm tired. By the time I got home, it was just too late to call. That's all. ", "Lucy: Right, that's all. I knew -- I knew that. Of course. It makes complete sense. Sorry. Well, maybe we can talk later, maybe. ", "Kevin: Mm-hmm. ", "Lucy: Ta. ", "Kevin: Ta. ", "Lucy: Ok, that was very smooth and nonchalant. Why didn't you just get a christmas light and interrogate him under the bright light? Hey, psst! You, get over here. What are you doing, \"mr. Almost blow everything\"? Also, \"mr. Spoiling a very romantic, sweet moment\" there? What were you thinking? Oh, my gosh, the scarf. I left -- I left the scarf he gave me over there. How rude could i be?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Lucy sighs] ", "kevin: Ouch. Well -- ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "clerk: For another special woman? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kevin: Very special, yes. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Ok, maybe next time. Bye. ", "Ian: What did quartermaine want? ", "Eve: He wanted me to speak at a conference about returning to work after childbirth. ", "Ian: Hmm, and why wouldn't you? ", "Eve: Because it's tonight and it's out of town, and that means I would have to leave right now, and that would ruin our completely special day. ", "Ian: Excuse me. ", "Eve: What are you doing? ", "Ian: Alan, hey. Thornhart. My wife changed her mind. She wants to speak at your conference. She'll be there, i promise you. All right. See you at work. ", "Eve: What are you doing? ", "Ian: I -- i don't know. Just that's us getting back to normal. That's what we want, right? ", "Eve: Right. ", "Ian: So let's do it and get back to being doctors, helping people, speaking at conferences, juggle our lives and our work. We enjoy that. ", "Eve: You're right. You're right. I can't remember the last time that you and i had a conversation about work and about being doctors and babies and -- ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "ian: About normal things. It might take some time, but we'll get back to it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Ok. I'll speak at the conference. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: I -- I really -- ", "chris: This is ridiculous. Just tell her the truth. Go on! Fine. He's got a thing going with gabriela. ", "Karen: What? ", "Chris: Yeah, he hooked up with her right off the rebound with you. See, i thought he should tell you himself, but clearly he's too much of a coward to do that. I thought you should know. ", "Rafe: Blow him out of the water, frank. Come on! ", "Chris: Besides, you've seen for yourself how they're joined at the hip. It was just a matter of time before you found out. ", "Karen: Tell me this is a bad joke of his. ", "Chris: Yeah, frank. Tell her. Tell her. ", "Frank: No, you tell her. ", "Karen: Tell me what? ", "Frank: Chris threatened to let you die if I didn't leave you. ", "Rafe: Ah, yes! Yes! ", "chris: Oh, come on. Karen, you couldn't possibly think I would do something like that. ", "Karen: It's exactly what you would do, chris. You'd threaten anything to get what you want and have things your way, but you know what? I'd rather be dead than away from frank and stuck with you. ", "Chris: Stuck with me. Well, then, fine. You two enjoy your final few days together because that's all you have. How could you be so stupid? ", "Frank: I'm betting even a snake like you wouldn't go so far as to let karen die. ", "Chris: Well, you bet wrong, frank. So you two kids, you can say good-bye to the precious antidote. ", "Rafe: I don't think so, chris. Even people without love in their hearts can have a few seasonal adjustments. You're going to make this right for them. And your punishment for being such a complete jerk is that you will not be able to lie to anyone, including yourself, until I leave port charles. ", "Chris: Oh, you know something, frank? You're right. I am a snake. What? ", "Frank: What? ", "Karen: Chris, what is it? ", "Chris: Hmm? ", "Karen: What's wrong with your face? ", "Chris: You see, karen, it's the truth. I fell in love with you and I was going to do anything to make you fall in love with me, including breaking off your engagement. That's why i planted the cocaine in your purse up at the cabin. That's why i took you to the cave. You see, there you would become terrified and you'd move in with me, you know, to keep up the lie. And here's the kicker -- i was going to keep you strung-out on the medication just so you'd become dependent on me, fall for my shallow act however long it took. ", "Karen: You scumbag. ", "Chris: Yeah, yeah, scumbag, that's me. ", "Frank: Why are you admitting all of this now? ", "Chris: Oh, god, i don't know, but you know what else i'm going to do? ", "Frank: What? ", "Chris: I'm going to give karen the rest of the antidote. ", "Karen: You are? ", "Chris: Yes, i am. I'm going to make you well without any personal gain to myself. This doesn't make any sense to me, either, so don't ask. You know, karen, it's just that i don't deserve you. I don't really deserve anybody -- not that I wish you two well or anything because, well, i don't because I'm too selfish a bastard to give a damn about anyone but myself. Ok? I have to go. ", "Karen: What was that? ", "Frank: I don't have a clue. ", "Rafe: That, my friends, was a true miracle. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lucy: You bought another scarf for another special woman? ", "Kevin: Livvie. That one is for livvie. ", "Lucy: You bought the same scarf you bought me? You bought that scarf for livvie, too? ", "Kevin: Well, why not? You like it. Come on, lucy, you have great taste. ", "Lucy: Oh, boy, doc, haven't you learned anything about fashion since we met?", "Kevin: What? ", "Lucy: Well, you don't buy the same gifts for the women in your life. You know, it's like the cardinal sin of fashion shopping. ", "Kevin: It is? ", "Lucy: Yes, yes. I mean, what if we showed up at the party wearing the exact same thing? That'd be awful. It's like those actresses on the red carpet. When they realize they're both wearing the same thing, they almost get into a huge cat fight. No, no, no, no. It's wrong. You have to treat the women as individuals. You know, we like to be special, that you picked out a certain something just for us. ", "Kevin: Oh, right. Right, right. ", "Lucy: Right. I tell you what -- why don't i help you pick out something else for livvie? ", "Kevin: Thanks. ", "Lucy: Ok. Ok, let's -- oh, no. Oh, yes. Ooh. ", "Kevin: Yeah? You think? ", "Lucy: Yes, don't you think this color would be -- oh, yoo-hoo, miss! Hello! Oh, hi. Thanks. Listen, would it be ok if he exchanges this scarf for the one he just got? ", "Clerk: No problem. They're the same price. ", "Kevin: Ah! ", "Lucy: Oh, that's great. ", "Kevin: Yeah. ", "Lucy: See, now, aren't you lucky I was here? ", "Kevin: This is my lucky day. Well -- love to chat, but I got to get back to the lighthouse. ", "Lucy: The lighthouse? I thought that you had a patient. ", "Kevin: I do. I do, but -- well, that's in about an hour, so i thought i'd just, you know, swing by the house. ", "Lucy: Oh, that's kind of nice. You know, maybe we have time to chat about the party and all. ", "Kevin: What if we hit traffic? ", "Lucy: The lighthouse is, like, 10 minutes from general hospital. You know, if i didn't know better, I'd sort of think maybe you were trying to get rid of me.", "Kevin: No. Of course not. We have time. Let's go. ", "Lucy: You know, I can follow you in my car. ", "Kevin: Ok. ", "Lucy: Ok. ", "Kevin: All right. ", "[Phone rings] ", "kevin: Hello. Yeah, I'm sorry, i'm sorry. I just got held up. I'll be there as soon as i can. ", "Lucy: Doc? ", "Kevin: Coming. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ian: Your mother's off doing something very, very important, but she'll be back tomorrow, and you'll have both of us at your whim again. All right? Hey, listen, I don't want you to worry, ok? Your mother and I have a few problems, but we'll work it out because I do love her very much. And you're right. You know what? I should tell her. I should tell her as soon as she gets back. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eve: Hi. Yeah. This is dr. Lambert. I'm supposed to speak at the conference tonight, and I think that i wrote down the directions wrong, so could you help me, please? Thanks. Then right.
