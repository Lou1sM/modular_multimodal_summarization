        "Alison: I missed you. ",
        "Jamal: What, I've only been gone, like, a few hours. ",
        "Alison: Right. Well, you know, don't let it happen again. ",
        "Jamal: Ooh. ",
        "Alison: So what's in the bag? ",
        "Jamal: Something I never thought I'd be buying for a woman until now. ",
        "Alison: Truffle oil? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. And a whole lot of other things that have never been on my \r\ngrocery list before. I was figuring maybe you could, you know, whip me up one of \r\nthose fancy-shmancy dinners. ",
        "Alison: Wait, wait. We can afford this and rent? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, you know, we can now. Yeah. I mean, I'm not trying to get all \r\nrespectable on you, nothing like that, but you are looking at a man with a \r\nj-o-b! ",
        "Alison: Oh, that's great! ",
        "",
        "Eve: Aside from the fact that we're being held hostage by a raving lunatic, \r\nthis is a lot like those all-nighters we used to pull in med school. ",
        "Ian: At least here we get room service. ",
        "Eve: Oh, great. Just like the roach motel. You can check in, but you can't --\r\n",
        "Ian: Hey. We'll get out of here. Just got to save Harris. What we really need \r\nis -- ",
        "Eve: A telephone. ",
        "Ian: Little bit of hope. Little bit of faith. Didn't you once say we made a \r\ngreat team? ",
        "[Eve sighs] ",
        "Eve: God, you know, it's amazing -- the way this parasite just destroys every \r\nbit of tissue in its path. It's the perfect predator. ",
        "Ian: Not quite perfect -- Harris is still alive. ",
        "Eve: You know what? I want him dead just as much as you do. The only problem \r\nis we have to save his life before we can get out of here. ",
        "Ian: Okay. And then we'll kill him later. Always think positive. ",
        "Eve: Either you're extremely sleep-deprived or you're channeling Pollyanna.\r\n",
        "Ian: I'd channel Brad Pitt if it'd make you feel better. ",
        "Eve: Brad Pitt isn't exactly my type. You know, when I felt bad, Kevin always \r\nused to do this funny thing. ",
        "Ian: He must be missing you terribly. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I want you. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- only you -- only you can make me forget Eve. ",
        "Lucy: Eve. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, no, Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: This is wrong. This is so wrong. ",
        "Kevin: No, Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc, it's so wrong. ",
        "Kevin: No. No. No, no -- ",
        "Lucy: It is. It is so wrong. It's wrong. ",
        "Livvie: Stop it! Stay away from her! ",
        "",
        "Alison: So give me all the details about your job, you know, so I can brag \r\nabout you. When do you get your first raise or promotion? ",
        "Jamal: Just stop, stop, stop. Look, don't go buy me a briefcase or nothing \r\nlike that. It's just a job, that's it. ",
        "Alison: Well, what kind of job? Do you have a female boss who I'm going to \r\nhave to kill? ",
        "Jamal: Stop, all right? Stop asking me all these questions, okay? All you \r\nneed to know is that I'm doing this so we can have a better life. Okay? ",
        "Alison: Oh, that's cool. ",
        "Jamal: I want to do things to you -- oops -- I mean, for you. ",
        "Alison: I love this -- ",
        "Jamal: For us, baby. ",
        "Alison: I love the sound of that. Okay, so I will stop being so nosy. But for \r\nnow, we need to celebrate. So as soon as I catch a break, I will go whip you up \r\nthe best dinner. It would even make Martha Stewart weep. ",
        "Jamal: You know, forget about dinner, okay? I got a better idea how we could \r\ncelebrate. When is your next break? Hmm? ",
        "Alison: It's -- now. It's right now. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Hey, come on. Hey, Victor, will you cover for me for a minute? It's \r\nan emergency. ",
        "Jamal: Big time. ",
        "Victor: Life goes on. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: You know what we need? A change of scene. So I've been thinking \r\nabout our romantic getaway. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, but, Gabby, listen -- ",
        "Gabriela: And Deneice told me about these cabins up at Lake Raines. It would \r\nbe so wonderful to wake up to the sound of birds, to wake up to the smell of \r\ncampfires, just to wake up to you. ",
        "Joe: Gabby, as much as I want to go away with you, I'm sorry, I -- I can't.\r\n",
        "",
        "Ian: You know it's not polite to stare. ",
        "Eve: I know. Sorry. It's just that I owe you a thank-you. ",
        "Ian: For what? Getting you into this mess? ",
        "Eve: No. Not for that. For defending my past when Harris threw it in my face. \r\nThank you. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: We've all had a past. You don't need to apologize, not to anyone -- not \r\nyou, not ever. ",
        "Eve: Well, I think we need a break. Huh? ",
        "Ian: Sure. We're not on the clock. ",
        "Eve: Mm-hmm. So tell me, what's the first thing you're going to do if and \r\nwhen -- when we get out of here? ",
        "Ian: I hadn't thought about it. ",
        "Eve: Oh, come on. You must have at least one -- one fantasy. Tell me what it \r\nis. Please? ",
        "Ian: I don't believe in fantasies. ",
        "Eve: Everybody has one. Just share it with me. One. Come on. ",
        "Ian: Okay. There's this little island just south of Borneo where the water is \r\n25 different shades of blue and the beaches go on forever. And most of all, it's \r\nfar away from civilization. ",
        "Eve: So, what, you'd go live there all by yourself like a hermit? ",
        "Ian: Mm-hmm. I mean, I would extend an invitation to the right person. What \r\nabout you? What do you dream of? ",
        "Eve: Going home, back to the people and the place I love. That's heaven to \r\nme. ",
        "Ian: Well, then the sooner we get you back to Kevin, the better, right? Okay, \r\njust got to figure out why the drugs that work on other people do not work on \r\nHarris. ",
        "Eve: Right. Well, it must be the virulence of the parasite. We need to find \r\nout how to get rid of those little critters. ",
        "Ian: I'll be damned. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Take a look. ",
        "Eve: Oh, my gosh. The level of infection in the tissue sample has decreased. \r\nDoes this mean that maybe -- ",
        "Ian: It means we got to run more tests. ",
        "Eve: Okay. ",
        "Ian: But not now. Let's take a break. My brain's fried. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, that's a good idea. You know, I have got a crick in my neck the \r\nsize of Texas. ",
        "Ian: Is that right? Well, I'll take care of that. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: Put yourself in my hands. ",
        "Eve: Okay. ",
        "Eve: Ian, do you think that you'll ever get to your island and I'll ever get \r\nhome? ",
        "Ian: I promised to get you out of here, so I will. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Oh, Livvie. I didn't expect you to be home. ",
        "Kevin: You said she wouldn't be back till later. We didn't think you'd be \r\nback till later. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, obviously. Lucy, are you all right? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'm fine. ",
        "Kevin: We're fine. ",
        "Lucy: I'm okay. ",
        "Kevin: We're fine. We're dandy. We're fine. ",
        "Livvie: Are you drunk? ",
        "Lucy: No, no -- ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Livvie: What is going on? Lucy, your blouse. ",
        "Lucy: It's just -- it's the snaps, you know. It's shoddy craftsmanship. I got \r\nto talk to that tailor who made this. It's really a poor job. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, it looked like Kevin was -- ",
        "Lucy: No -- I know it did. That's not what it was. ",
        "Livvie: Well, something was going on. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "Kevin: Smart girl. She's a very smart girl. ",
        "Livvie: God, I can't believe you're here like this, drunk and trying to --\r\n",
        "Lucy: Look, no. Livvie, stop. This is not what you think. You don't \r\nunderstand. See, Doc was just having a bad day, and he needed to talk to somebody, \r\nand I was listening, that's all. ",
        "Kevin: You don't have to make excuses for me, Lucy. It's time Livvie saw who \r\nI really am. Livvie, it's time you saw your real dad. ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not time. This is not the right -- ",
        "Kevin: You see, the truth is, Livvie, I'm sorry to disappoint you -- I'm \r\nsorry to disappoint the whole world -- but I'm no knight in shining armor. I'm \r\njust a man. I'm just a man who's fresh out of answers and clean out of clues. \r\nAnd I'm sick and tired of being a role model for everything that's noble and \r\ngood. St. Kevin has left the building. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I see exactly who you are. ",
        "Lucy: No, Livvie, wait -- wait -- ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Every morning I got to tear myself away from you. And when we are \r\napart, all I think about is coming home to you. And taking you in my arms like \r\nthis and showing you how much you mean to me. ",
        "Alison: Why don't you show me again, then? ",
        "",
        "Joe: I'll make this up to you big time. ",
        "Gabriela: You don't have to. I mean, it's not about a trip, it's about being \r\nwith you. ",
        "Joe: And you know how much I want that. ",
        "Gabriela: Maybe there's a way we can have it all. ",
        "Joe: What do you mean? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I know a cozy, romantic spot where we can get away and still \r\nbe close. ",
        "Joe: Where? ",
        "Gabriela: My apartment. ",
        "",
        "Victor: Livvie. I was just thinking about you, about how lucky we are to have \r\nyou in the family. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, no offense, but I don't think I want to be any part of \r\nyour family. One crazy family is enough for this lifetime. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I am trying to help you, but I cannot do that if you're going to be a \r\njerk to me and to poor Livvie. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I don't need this. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Why don't you just go ahead and wallow in your own self-pity, \r\nbut you're going to do it alone, by yourself. ",
        "Kevin: Fine with me. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. ",
        "Kevin: You know, I think having your wife die in the arms of her lover \r\nentitles you to a little wallowing. ",
        "Lucy: You do not know that is what happened. Look at me. What happens when \r\nI'm in trouble? You come to me, and you say, \"Lucy, you get a grip.\" Well, Doc, \r\nthat's what you need to do right now. You have to stop and get a grip. Or are \r\nyou too afraid? Is that it? You're afraid to follow your -- ",
        "Kevin: You're not listening to me, Lucy! The whole time she was with me \r\ntelling me she loved me, she was thinking about another man. Do you have \r\nany idea what that feels like? I'll tell you what it feels like. It's killing \r\nme. And I want to mourn my wife, but I can't because I'm so angry! ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Then be angry. You know, I think you're right. You're -- you're \r\nright. You know, Eve doesn't deserve mourning. She was nothing but a conceited, \r\nself-centered witch who never thought about anybody but herself. ",
        "Kevin: Shut up. Shut up! Don't you dare say that. Don't you dare talk about \r\nher like that. You didn't know her. You didn't know her like I did. She was \r\nkind, she was giving, she was warm. And she was loving. She was so loving. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Boy, you got great hands. ",
        "Ian: It was either be a doctor or be a masseur. ",
        "[Eve laughs] ",
        "Eve: At this point, I'd say you missed your calling. Ooh. ",
        "Ian: I can go all night. ",
        "Eve: Knowing what I do about you, I'm sure that's possible. ",
        "Ian: You think you know me, huh? ",
        "Eve: Not really. I don't know what touches you, what moves you, what you \r\nhate, and what you love. Well? ",
        "Ian: Let me get on with it. ",
        "Eve: Okay. ",
        "Ian: I like single malt Irish whiskey. I like the smell of my father's field \r\nafter a long rain. And I like anything by O'Neill because he infuses everything, \r\neven hopelessness, with the power of passion. ",
        "Eve: So we've got O'Neill, your father's field after a rain, and Irish \r\nwhiskey. What else? ",
        "Ian: Children. They're hope for the future. They make you believe that \r\nanything's possible because to them it is. ",
        "Eve: Yeah, you know, that's true. When I was a kid, I wanted to grow up and \r\nbe something spectacular, really make a difference, be special. ",
        "Ian: Well, you've achieved your goal. You're very special, Eve. ",
        "Eve: I think maybe we should get back to work now. ",
        "Ian: I want you in bed. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Let me fight the evil parasites for a while. You go get some rest. ",
        "Eve: Oh, right. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. ",
        "Ian: I'll wake you if I find anything. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Hey, baby. ",
        "Alison: You know, it's really sweet that you wanted to get a job and take \r\ncare of me and everything, but you do know that you have nothing to prove to me, \r\nright? ",
        "Jamal: Mm-hmm. Well, I'll just take back that little red Corvette I got for \r\nyou, then. ",
        "Alison: I'm serious, Jamal. Look, we have food and a roof over our heads and \r\neach other, and that's, you know, all that we really need. ",
        "Jamal: Okay. Well, we'll see how you feel when those lights get cut off, too.\r\n",
        "Alison: Oh, now, see, it's all in the way that you look at it because there's \r\nplenty of things that we can do in the dark. ",
        "[Telephone rings] ",
        "Alison: And I hope the first thing they do is shut off the phone. ",
        "Jamal: Watch out. ",
        "Alison: Ouch. ",
        "Jamal: Sorry. Hello. It's for me. ",

        "Jamal: I'll take it with you. ",
        "Alison: Okay, well, be quick and meet me in there. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Mm-mm-mm. Give me one second. Look, I told you I was cool \r\nabout starting tomorrow. All right, but come on, call me on my cell phone if you \r\nneed to talk to me. ",
        "[Shower runs] ",
        "Jamal: I don't want my girl to find out what I'm doing, all right? All right. \r\nPeace. ",
        "",
        "Joe: Tomorrow, your place. We start with dinner. ",
        "Gabriela: Maybe we could skip dinner, go straight to dessert. ",
        "Joe: Sounds like a plan. ",
        "Gabriela: The reason my apartment's such a great retreat -- it's quiet, it's \r\ncomfy, and there's no checkout time. ",
        "Joe: Oh. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: And maybe I shouldn't be talking to you about this, but I just walked \r\nin on Kevin practically accosting Lucy, and it really freaked me out. ",
        "Victor: Uh -- well, Kevin and Lucy have a very long history, Livvie. I'm sure \r\nthat he wouldn't be doing anything to hurt her. ",
        "Livvie: No, no, no. But Kevin was so out of control. I've never seen him like \r\nthat before. And I already had one parent go psycho on me. ",
        "Victor: Well, I can understand you wanting your father to be perfect, but -- \r\nand my son's a wonderful person. It's just that the way the world works is that \r\nhe's a human being and that means he's flawed. ",
        "Livvie: I guess I just thought I could have one person in my life who wasn't.\r\n",
        "",
        "Kevin: You don't know who Eve really was, Lucy. You have no clue what she \r\nreally meant to me. ",
        "Lucy: I think I do. ",
        "Kevin: We loved each other. We shared a wonderful life. ",
        "Lucy: So you have to fight for her. You have to fight for Eve, Doc. You have \r\nto fight. You do. You have to fight to try and save all those wonderful, good \r\nmemories you have of Eve. Please don't let them be ruined by some half-written \r\nnote you found in Ian's apartment. ",
        "Kevin: What he wrote about her, Lucy. I mean, it sounded like they were \r\nhaving an affair right under my nose. ",
        "Lucy: You don't know that. Maybe it was just Ian, you know, being Ian and \r\nwriting some crazy limerick because there's a lot of words that rhyme with \r\n\"Eve.\" ",
        "Kevin: I -- I don't believe you're talking about Eve like this. I'm -- the \r\ntwo of you never really even liked each other. ",
        "Lucy: No. But I like you, Doc. I like you very much. So, you see, you can't \r\ndoubt Eve. She would not want you to doubt her. You have to fight -- fight for \r\nthe woman you love. You -- you -- you fight for Eve. ",
