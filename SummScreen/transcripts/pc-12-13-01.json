Oh, and scott, of course -- as usual, scott has not rsvp'd, but I know he's going to come and I know he's going to want to sit with serena, which means he'll probably have to sit with us. It's you and me and scott and serena and victor. I hope that's ok. Doc, is that ok? ", "Kevin: Hmm? ", "Lucy: What are you doing? Are you trying to find a hiding place for that scarf i helped you pick out for livvie? ", "Kevin: Yeah. Hiding. Right. ", "Lucy: Oh. Well, don't tell me. You know how i am. If i know where a christmas hiding place is, i'll just go right to it and find them. You know i can't help myself. Ok, now, this other list of food, i was thinking, should we do the christmas cookies in reindeer shapes? You know, maybe donner -- of course, you can't really tell donner from blitzen. Rudolph you can always tell with the red nose, but you can't -- maybe a sheet cake or a bunt cake or -- you know, maybe a gingerbread house would lend some elegance. Cookies, gingerbread -- hey, what do you think? ", "Kevin: Uh -- sorry. Cookies? ", "Lucy: You're right, cookies. It's got to be cookies. I mean, thanks. You know, it wouldn't be a traditional christmas party without cookies, and you just saved me from talking myself out of something i love so much, and I really appreciate that. Thank you.

I'm just catching up with mary. ", "Mary: Yeah. Tell me, how is that adorable baby of yours? Has he posed for a baby food label yet? ", "Ian: No, no, his mother won't let him audition. ", "Mary: Sounds like she wants to keep all that cuteness at home just for the two of you. ", "Ian: Yeah, well, truth be told, she's not home at all. She's speaking at a doctors' conference and i'm very proud of her. Which reminds me, I'm going to give her a call, see how she's doing. I told her i would.

Come on. ", "Chris: Why on earth would you be nice to me, huh? Huh. No, I mean, haven't you remembered all the lousy things i've done to you since you got to town?

Are you doing some kind of experiment? ", "Chris: No, no, nothing like that. I wish to god I was. Then i'd have an explanation for it all. I just came from the hospital where I told a patient that instead of sending him the bill, I'd like to spend the weekend with his wife. I went into detail.

", "Chris: Ever since you got to town, everybody likes you, respects you. I hate that. I hate that you have a relationship with livvie that i couldn't have -- something i haven't had since julie left me. And, most of all, I hate the fact that you walked right back into my life after years ago I told you to stay the hell away from the whole family. ", "Jack: Ok, chris. Now that you have all that off your chest, why don't you tell me why you left me alone in social services? Why you just dumped me there and walked away?

Yeah, I would really like that, dad. I would, but --", "kevin: But what? Something wrong? ", "Livvie: No. No, not wrong at all. It's just -- well, I probably won't be around much from now on.

", "Alison: Yes, i'm positive, with all of my heart. Ok, jamal, there is nothing between me and rafe, and he knows that, too. Ok, we are just friends. That's all.

And jamal's right, i -- I think about rafe way too much. I spend too much time with him and spend too much time talking about him and that has got to stop right now.

Let's not -- it's a big surprise, it's a huge secret. That's what all this act, kind of putting on stuff, you know? It's a surprise and he's worked so hard to make sure it is, so you cannot -- you swear? ", "Livvie: Ok, ok, ok. Are you sure? But how did you find out about all this stuff? ", "Lucy: Just a minute. Sit right there. Ok. These were delivered when he was out. I've had such a hard time staying quiet and not admitting i know. Look at this. ", "Livvie: Come on, come on!

Could I ask a big favor of you?", "Rafe: Of course. ", "Mary: Well, you're a close friend of alison's. This package just came for her out back, and I'm afraid it might be something important.

I'll leave it behind the bar, and she can come pick it up whenever she wants and -- ok, no answer. Huh. Well, I guess maybe if no one's home, there's no harm in dropping by. I'll just leave this here and get out because the last thing i want to do is be here when alison gets back from wherever she is. ", "Alison: Rafe! ", "Rafe: Alison.

Oh, you know, keeping this wedding a secret is -- is so sweet. It's a great surprise, but it's killing me! You know how i am? Like, if you hide the christmas presents and i find out where they're hidden, then of course i got to peek and -- i always do act surprised, really surprised when i'm not supposed to be surprised, but i am surprised because I know i'm supposed to be surprised. Peeking is the same as listening in, right? Right, so maybe if i just listen in and you're talking to the florist, then i'll know what dress color to wear.
