        "Lucy: Oh. ",
        "Scott: Seat taken? ",
        "Lucy: I was beginning to think maybe you stood me up. ",
        "Scott: No, I was -- you know my barber, Kaputo? He's actually being sued for \r\nsome bad haircuts. ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. Listen, do you think we still have time for lunch? ",
        "Scott: If it's okay with you. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I mean, we got the board meeting and all, but it's okay with me. \r\nWhy wouldn't it be? ",
        "Scott: Well, I heard about the fire at the lighthouse and everything. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, that. Yeah, I didn't inhale that much smoke. Trust me. ",
        "Scott: You sure you shouldn't be resting or something? ",
        "Lucy: I'm positive. What is with you? I'm not in the mood for this \r\ncross-examination. ",
        "Scott: I can see that. ",
        "Lucy: You can? How come? ",
        "Scott: Well, when I came in, the look on your face. It's, you know, when your \r\nworld has just gone upside down. ",
        "Lucy: You got me. It's Kevin. He is really at a loss over all this, and I \r\nfeel so terrible for him because I want to help him but I think I've done just \r\nthe opposite. ",
        "Scott: Why would you say that? You're a good friend to him. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but I wasn't brave enough just to come right out and tell him the \r\ntruth. ",
        "Scott: Now, what truth are we talking about? ",
        "Lucy: That his wife was really in love with another man. ",
        "",
        "Eve's voice: I've been wanting to do this for so long. ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. Oh, God, now I'm fantasizing about him. Oh, God. Okay. ",
        "Eve's voice: \"Dear Kevin, I can't tell you how much I miss you, how much I \r\nwant to be in your arms right now. If this letter somehow manages to reach you, \r\njust know that I love you and I always will.\" ",
        "Ian: Morning. ",
        "Eve: Hey. Ian. ",
        "Ian: Whatcha doing? ",
        "Eve: Nothing. Just doing research. ",
        "Ian: There's no need for that anymore. ",
        "Eve: Well, what do you mean? If we're going to cure Harris, we have to do --\r\n",
        "Ian: We're finished. ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: I came up with something that will get us out of here. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Oh, no, you're crazy. Harris will never go for that. ",
        "Ian: He doesn't have a choice. What else -- ",
        "Harris: Please, don't stop talking on my account. ",
        "Eve: Don't you ever knock? ",
        "Harris: Why should I? Unless there's something going on in here I'm not aware \r\nof. ",
        "Ian: How you feeling, Harris? You look like hell. ",
        "Harris: Thank you for your very professional assessment. ",
        "Ian: Trouble breathing? ",
        "Harris: A bit. ",
        "Ian: Chest? ",
        "Harris: What is it? ",
        "Ian: Irregular heartbeat. Means the disease is progressing. ",
        "Harris: What do you intend to do about that? ",
        "Eve: We'll try putting you on Digoxin. ",
        "Harris: What is that? ",
        "Eve: It regulates the heart. ",
        "Ian: We still have to find out the underlying problem because if not, you're \r\ngoing to have a fatal heart attack. ",
        "Eve: But we are doing everything we can to find a cure. ",
        "Harris: Why haven't you found one yet? ",
        "Ian: Well, we might have had a bit of a breakthrough last night. ",
        "Harris: Last night? You discovered something last night? ",
        "Ian: Yes. ",
        "Harris: Why didn't you tell me? What -- ",
        "Ian: We hadn't completed the tests. Want to make sure it works. ",
        "Eve: And we're still running more tests just to make sure, so -- ",
        "Harris: What kind of game are you playing, Thornhart? Do you have something \r\nto help me or don't you? ",
        "Ian: Yes. But the treatment's very dangerous. ",
        "Harris: What is it? What does it involve? Is it surgery? Is it radiation? Is \r\nit drugs? What is it? ",
        "Ian: No, it's very simple. All you have to do is take a dose of this. ",
        "Harris: What is that? ",
        "Ian: Poison. ",

        "Livvie: Jack. How did you know I'd be here? ",
        "Jack: Well, when I couldn't get a hold of you, I figured you'd turn up at your \r\nmom's place. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Well, why are you here? ",
        "Jack: Because I needed to see you. And my guess is you need me, too. ",

        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Chris: Denny, hey, thanks for coming over. ",
        "Denny: Yeah, it sounded urgent. ",
        "Chris: It is. It's about that little problem that I have. ",
        "Denny: Does the little problem have a name? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. Jack Ramsey. It's my kid brother. ",
        "Denny: You want me to find him? ",
        "Chris: No, I want you to help me get rid of him -- permanently. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Remember I told you before I really didn't want to believe it? But it's \r\ntrue. ",
        "Scott: Lucy, how do you know? ",
        "Lucy: I saw this note that Ian wrote to Eve. ",
        "Scott: What kind of a note? ",
        "Lucy: I guess it wasn't really a note, you know? It was just a line he'd \r\nwritten, and it wasn't really delivered, I don't think. I mean, she didn't read \r\nit, but it said they kissed, they actually kissed. So I know they were having an \r\naffair. They were together. ",
        "Scott: Lucy, I -- ",
        "Lucy: No, I know what I'm talking about, Scott. I do. ",
        "Scott: I thought that you didn't say anything to Kevin. ",
        "Lucy: I didn't. He knew already because he saw the note. I think that's why \r\nhe got so drunk and almost died in that fire. ",
        "Scott: So you think that he saw this note and that he thought they were \r\nfooling around? That's what -- ",
        "Lucy: That's what he said. So then, of course, he had to ask me if I knew, \r\nand I said, \"No, they weren't. They're not. Couldn't be true.\" Because I \r\ncouldn't do it to him. I couldn't make him suffer like that. ",
        "Scott: You did the right thing. ",
        "Lucy: I did the right thing? I told him a lie, a huge, big lie. This is not, \r\nlike, a little white lie. This is a huge lie. ",
        "Scott: Eve and Ian are dead, okay, so what difference does it make now? At \r\nleast Kevin has the memory of his wife intact. I mean, he has his dignity left.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Maybe you're right, but, still, it galls me to know that I sat \r\nthere and allowed Kevin to believe that that two-timing hussy is some sort of \r\nsaint. ",
        "Scott: \"Two-timing?\" Lucy, are you listening to yourself at all? ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I know, I just -- I called her a hussy, and she's gone. I'm \r\nsorry because I know you really liked Eve. But what she has done is \r\nunforgivable. ",
        "Scott: This isn't about Eve. It's about you. You're falling back in love with \r\nKevin.",
        "",
        "Jack: So, you going to move in here? ",
        "Livvie: I don't know yet. I just thought I'd come by and get the place \r\ncleaned up and go through some of my mother's things. ",
        "Jack: This has got to be so tough for you. I mean, we're kind of going \r\nthrough a lot of the same stuff. ",
        "Livvie: You and Chris. ",
        "Jack: It still blows my mind that he's actually my brother. ",
        "Livvie: Oh.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. You've got to tell me what's going on here. ",
        "Livvie: What do you mean? ",
        "Jack: You're acting different. ",
        "Livvie: Am I? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Did Chris tell you something? ",
        "Livvie: No, Chris didn't tell me anything, but Alison Barrington did. ",
        "Jack: Alison Barrington? You got to be kidding me. That whacked-out -- ",
        "Livvie: She happens to be a really nice person. ",
        "Jack: All right, maybe she is a nice person, but what did she say to you? ",
        "Livvie: That you took money to pose as her boyfriend. ",
        "Jack: Oh -- ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which actually wouldn't be a big deal, but then I \r\nthink about what Chris said, and -- ",
        "Jack: Come on, Livvie. Don't tell me you believe that crap. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I don't know. I have been wrong about every single person I've \r\never trusted. ",
        "Jack: Well, I'm not like that. ",
        "Livvie: No? ",
        "Jack: No. ",
        "Livvie: I can't help wondering, are you really this great, caring, sensitive \r\nguy that I thought you were? Or are you playing me? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Is that what you really think? You really think I'm falling for Doc \r\nagain? ",
        "Scott: Well, it's just that I know that look in your eyes. I've seen it \r\nbefore. ",
        "Lucy: I don't -- I don't know what to say. ",
        "Scott: There's nothing to say. We've just both gone through some changes. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, right. So, you know, I -- I hear you're sort of -- you've been \r\nseen with Laura Spencer. ",
        "Scott: Yes. Yes, I have. I guess we're both jumping in the time machine, \r\naren't we? ",
        "Lucy: Yep. I guess that's what we're supposed to do, huh? Sort of try and \r\nmove on. ",
        "Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't make it any less -- ",
        "Lucy: Sad? ",
        "Scott: Very sad. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. But you know us. We'll get through it, right? We always do. ",
        "Scott: Of course, Lucy, because we're always going to be pals. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, always. And we share a child, you know, and that's -- we'll \r\nalways be connected. But you know what? It's more than that. We are so much \r\nalike, and we know each other better than anybody in the whole wide world, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Scott: And that's why I'm saying when I say this to you that I think you \r\nshould just drop this thing with Ian and Eve because it's not going to do you or \r\nKevin any good. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but why would he do that, you know? ",
        "Scott: First of all, maybe he never sent the note and maybe the kiss never \r\nreally existed. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah, maybe you're right. I never thought of that. ",
        "Scott: Yeah, because the kiss didn't actually ever happen. ",
        "Lucy: Okay, maybe you're right. Maybe I should just forget the whole thing, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Scott: Yeah, because it might have been something that he maybe had \r\nfantasized about that he just kind of wrote down for the hell of it but it was \r\nnever followed through. You know what I'm saying? ",
        "Lucy: Okay. Okay, then I should try to drop it. ",
        "Scott: Absolutely drop it because no good is going to come. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Okay, I will. ",
        "Scott: No, not \"should.\" ",
        "Lucy: I will. I'll try, okay? ",
        "Scott: Okay, no, listen to me. Just repeat after me. I'm going to drop this.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Okay. I don't have to do the repeat business. I will. I swear on your \r\nhair that I will drop it. I will never bring up Eve and Ian's torrid -- alleged \r\ntorrid love affair ever again. ",
        "",
        "Harris: Poison? You want me to take poison? Are you out of your mind? ",
        "Ian: It's the only chance we -- ",
        "Harris: You think I'm a fool? ",
        "Ian: If I were going to kill you, do you think I'd tell you it's poison? ",
        "Harris: I would think you would have to, knowing that whatever you gave me I \r\nwould have analyzed first. ",
        "Ian: If you would just listen for one second -- ",
        "Harris: You know, you cannot be trusted. I know that now. After today, you're \r\ngoing to be in a lot of trouble. ",
        "Eve: Harris -- Harris, please wait. Just let us explain, okay? ",
        "Harris: Yes, you do that. Explain to me how taking poison is going to make me \r\nwell. I'm so curious to hear that. ",
        "Eve: It is not the poison that will cure you. The parasite in your system is \r\nblocking any kind of treatment that might fight this disease. ",
        "Ian: If we don't kill the parasite, there's nothing we can do for you. ",
        "Harris: And just so coincidentally, the poison is the only thing strong \r\nenough to kill it. Is that it? ",
        "Ian: Yes. That's what the research shows. ",
        "Eve: Ian told you there might be some kind of risk involved. ",
        "Ian: We're only giving you enough poison to attack the parasite. Shouldn't be \r\nenough to kill you. ",
        "Harris: \"Shouldn't?\" \"Shouldn't\" isn't good enough. Find something else. ",
        "Eve: No, please wait, Harris. Please. ",
        "Harris: What? ",
        "Eve: Look, we have done every experiment, tried every treatment possible. \r\nThere is no other way. I want to go home. I want to go home to my husband. ",
        "Harris: I wouldn't worry about him if I were you. I mean, a woman like you is \r\njust so easily replaced at the right amount of money. ",
        "Ian: That's enough. ",
        "Eve: No, Ian, please. I don't care what he says. ",
        "Ian: I care! This woman's been working day and night to save your twisted \r\nlife only that she can get out of here and go home to her husband. No one's \r\nplaying games here. You either take your chance with the poison or you die. ",
        "Harris: You know, I think it is time that somebody re-establishes who calls \r\nthe shots. ",
        "",
        "Denny: How exactly do you expect me to get rid of Jack? ",
        "Chris: Let me worry about that. Just dig up as much dirt on him as you can. \r\nBelieve me, there'll be plenty. ",
        "Denny: Then what? Threats? Blackmail? ",
        "Chris: Whatever it takes to get him out of town. ",
        "Denny: You're going to an awful lot of trouble. I take it you two have some \r\nbad history. ",
        "Chris: Well, this really isn't about me. I'm doing it for someone else. And \r\nbelieve me, she's definitely worth the trouble. ",
        "Denny: You're doing this for some chick? Is that what you're telling me? ",
        "Chris: It's really none of your concern, Denny. ",
        "Denny: Jeez. I hope she isn't another serial killer. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, Livvie is nothing like Julie. ",
        "Denny: Livvie? That's that girl you had me track down her father. ",
        "Chris: Denny, I just said this is none of your concern. ",
        "Denny: So what? You in love with her? ",
        "Chris: Love really has nothing to do with it. Wouldn't make that mistake \r\ntwice. ",
        "Denny: Then what do you want from her? ",
        "Chris: Denny, you ever like to play with clay when you were a kid? You know, \r\nyou mold it, shape it, turn it into anything you want? ",
        "Denny: So you're going to mold her into your perfect woman? Sounds a little \r\nweird if you ask me. ",
        "Chris: I didn't ask you. Just get the goods on Jack. ",
        "Denny: Because he gets in the way of your plans for the lady. ",
        "Chris: Once I get Jack out of town, Livvie will be mine, just the way it \r\nshould be. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Livvie, I don't know what I can say to convince you. Maybe nothing. \r\nObviously, I can see that you have some big trust issues here after everything \r\nthat happened with your mom. ",
        "Livvie: This is not just about my mother. ",
        "Jack: I know, all right? A lot of people have let you down. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I thought it was all over, then yesterday -- ",
        "Jack: What? I mean, what happened? ",
        "Livvie: I -- I caught Kevin -- my father -- in this really -- it just -- it \r\nwas not a good moment. ",
        "Jack: And now you don't know what to think of him, either, right? ",
        "Livvie: Or you. I mean, suddenly you're Chris' brother? ",
        "Jack: You got to believe me, I'm just as shocked as you are. ",
        "Livvie: Tell me, you really didn't know? ",
        "Jack: No. Livvie, a lot of people have disappointed me in my life. I've lost \r\nloved ones, too. ",
        "Livvie: I know. I mean, how did you deal with your mother dying? ",
        "Jack: I'm still working on that one. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I was so hard on you. ",

        "Livvie: Good. ",
