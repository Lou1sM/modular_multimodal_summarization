        "rafe: Uh -- ",
        "alison: Uh, rafe! What are you doing here? ",
        "Rafe: Um -- um -- oh -- ",
        "alison: No! ",
        "Rafe: Alison -- ",
        "alison: Uh, just -- turn -- turn around! ",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am. I'm really -- ",
        "alison: Isn't that a little late to cover your eyes, don't you think? ",
        "Rafe: I just -- I -- i called and I -- so I thought you weren't here, but \r\nhere you are. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, here i am. I was in the shower. ",
        "Rafe: Right. Well, this stuff came for you at the restaurant, and mary was \r\nworried that you might really need it, so -- ",
        "alison: Yeah -- yeah, well, I guess now she doesn't have to worry now, does \r\nshe? Um -- right, so just give me a minute, ok? Um -- ok. ",
        "[Door closes] ",
        "rafe: Oh, boy. This wasn't part of the plan. You know, but sometimes a little \r\nmagic happens and -- no, no, rafe, don't go there. No, you can't go there. \r\nWhatever you're feeling, you just think you're feeling because angels can't -- \r\nwait a minute. This is a test. Right? Ok, well, roger wilco, boss. Lesson \r\nlearned, over and out. Won't happen again. Ok? Thanks. But did you have to hit \r\nme so hard right between the eyes, though? ",
        "Valerie: It's ok. It's plenty of time. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Valerie: For a while there, I thought you might miss the plane, too. ",
        "Jamal: Val, what are you doing here? ",
        "Valerie: Surprise. Looks like i'm coming with you after all. ",
        "Kevin: Anyway, I'll be there as soon as i can, all right? The minute i get \r\nrid of lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, doc. Doc, what -- you're going to get rid of me? Get -- ",
        "kevin: Uh, lucy -- ",
        "lucy: So you want to get right back to this partyplanning stuff here? ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, i can't. I -- ",
        "lucy: What, um, you -- what? That -- you have a patient? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yes, and i have to get over there right away. ",
        "Lucy: Right. Well, um, you know, the holidays really do hit some people very \r\nhard. She must be in pretty bad shape. ",
        "Kevin: What makes you think it's a woman? ",
        "Lucy: Did I -- did i say that? I didn't -- I didn't mean that. He or she, \r\nwhoever it is, must be in bad shape, you know. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Doc, it was just -- it's a lucky guess, you know? You know how my radar \r\ngoes up, so wherever you were going to be is probably the hospital. When someone \r\nneeds you, you're going to be there, right? ",
        "Kevin: Right. ",
        "Lucy: Right. ",
        "Kevin: Right, and i am sorry to have to run out on you like this. ",
        "Lucy: No problem. I'm sure you'll be back when you get rid of her. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: I -- i just mean with you running out like this with all this party \r\nplanning to do, that this -- this person must be really bad off, maybe suicidal \r\nor something, very serious? ",
        "Kevin: All right, that's enough. Lucy -- what's going on here? ",
        "Lucy: Nothing. What do you mean? Nothing's going on. I was just -- ",
        "kevin: I know when you're fishing. And you also know never to ask about a \r\npatient, so why are you asking? What's this about? ",
        "Ian: Come on, come on. ",
        "Colleen: Yes, mrs. Mirren, I'll have dr. Mckellan call right away. Uh-huh.\r\n",
        "Ian: Has eve called in yet? ",
        "Colleen: No, not yet. Do you want me to page her again? ",
        "Ian: No. I'm sure she's going to call once she gets one of the last five \r\nwe've sent her. ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "colleen: Oh. Excuse me. Hello, sixth floor. Uh, yes, he is. Ian, it's for \r\nyou, but it's not -- ",
        "ian: Ok. Thornhart. Yeah -- now, who is this? Yeah -- ok. No, I understand \r\nthat. I'm -- i'm on my way. I -- ",
        "colleen: Are you ok? ",
        "Ian: Do me a favor. Can you keep an eye on daniel? He's down in the daycare \r\ncenter. ",
        "Colleen: Of course. ",
        "Ian: Thanks. ",
        "Colleen: Ian? ",
        "Ian: Yeah? ",
        "Colleen: What's going on? ",
        "Ian: That was the police. Something's happened with eve. ",
        "lucy: What do you mean what's going on? You know, I think I pretty much told \r\nyou wt I mean. I said what I mean, and, you know, when I say that, you have to \r\nunderstand i mean what i say when I say what i mean, and I just said that. I \r\nmean what I said, so why -- why are you confused? ",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh. Never mind. ",
        "Lucy: So you're -- you will be back right after you see your patient? ",
        "Kevin: Well, lucy, I'm just not sure how long this will take. This could take \r\na while. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, but, you know, I can't really plan an entire party all by my little \r\nlonesome. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I got to go. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, you do, so you just -- you go right ahead. What's stopping you?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Look, lucy, your party plans go through at least 85 variations before \r\nyou're even half satisfied. I promise you I will look at the 86th variation and \r\ntell you that it's perfect as soon as i can, but right now -- ",
        "lucy: I know, you're late and you really should be going, so go. I will just \r\ntake care of whatever has to get done here. ",
        "Kevin: You always do. I can count on that much. ",
        "[Door opens and closes] ",
        "lucy: Yeah, well -- count on this! Oh, gosh. No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop it. \r\nStay calm. You are not going to lose it because doc would not lie to you. He \r\njust wouldn't after everything we've been through, and I trust him. I trust him \r\ncompletely. And I love him, so i'm fine. Back to work. Well, you know, it never \r\nreally hurts to make sure. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, you are not coming with me to chicago. ",
        "Valerie: Hope is my child, too. I've got just as much at stake there as you \r\ndo. ",
        "Jamal: For the last time, it's one thing for me to show up at the hartmans', \r\nbut with you along, valerie, it's going to look like an ambush. Ok, the whole \r\npoint of this trip was to tell them i'm giving up my parental rights so they \r\nstop running. ",
        "Valerie: And my whole point is to try to talk you out of this! ",
        "Jamal: But I thought we had an understanding about this, valerie. ",
        "Valerie: No, no, you just made a decision and told me about it and that was \r\nthat. But it's not. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, you are not going. ",
        "Valerie: Just try and stop me. If you take off, i'm taking off. ",
        "Jamal: Really? ",
        "Valerie: Really. Yes, really, and there is nothing you can do about it. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, no, we'll see about that, valerie. ",
        "[Door closes] ",
        "jamal: Wait, sir, i got to get on the plane. I got a ticket. ",
        "Attendant: No, I'm sorry. All passengers have to be seated five minutes \r\nbefore departure. The rules are on your boarding pass. Besides, we don't need \r\nthis sort of agitation on our flights. ",
        "Jamal: But, sir, wait, wait, waitwait. Damn it, valerie! See what you did?\r\n",
        "Valerie: They'll give us a refu ",
        "jamal: Sir, wait, wait -- ",
        "valerie: It's too late, jamal, the plane's on the ruay. It's too late. ",
        "Rafe: Great job, rafe. You had to drop something full of the gooiest, \r\ngoopiest -- ugh. ",
        "Alison: Ok, so, um -- ",
        "rafe: Alison -- ",
        "alison: It's all clear. What? ",
        "Rafe: Oh. ",
        "Alison: What, am i -- is there something on me? Am i -- what? ",
        "Rafe: Beautiful. ",
        "Alison: What? ",
        "Rafe: I'm sorry, i just -- ",
        "alison: No, listen. Don't -- don't be sorry, ok? You just -- ",
        "rafe: No, I mean about the -- the mess. ",
        "Alison: Right. ",
        "Rafe: You know, making it and walking in here. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess they don't have doors in heaven. Only pearly gates, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Rafe: But I didn't think you were here, and -- and mary sent me over -- ",
        "alison: Right, i know, I know. You told me that story, like, a million times. \r\nIt's ok. Just calm down. I'm not upset. ",
        "Rafe: You're not? ",
        "Alison: No. I mean, it's not like you knew that this would happen, right? ",
        "Rafe: No, of course not. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's not like you did it on purpose because i highly doubt \r\nthat, you know, peeping toms have halos, you know. ",
        "Rafe: No. No, no. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, right. Hmm. Ok. So -- oh, I guess that we should -- ",
        "rafe: Oh, right. ",
        "Alison: Probably clean this up and stuff, huh? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's kind of a mess, huh? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, you're telling me. It's -- yeah. ",
        "Alison: So i think that I'm just going to get something wet to mop this up \r\nwith. ",
        "Rafe: Alison, I just -- I hope i didn't embarrass you, that's all. ",
        "Alison: No. No, you didn't embarrass me. You know, it was nothing. We're \r\nfriends, rafe. So, you know, it was really nothing. Just forget it, ok? Just \r\nforget. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Right. Forget about it. It's nothing. ",
        "Ian: Andy. Andy! Andy: Ian. ",
        "Ian: What happened? What's going on? ",
        "Andy: Come on, let's go in back where we can -- ",
        "ian: We're not going anywhere. Tell me right here, right now. ",
        "Andy: Just take it easy. ",
        "Ian: Answer me! ",
        "Andy: Ian, i'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this. ",
        "Ian: Tell me what? Spit it out. ",
        "Andy: Dr. Lambert's car -- a pair of highway patrolmen spotted it at the \r\nbottom of a ravine about 20 miles outside the city limits. ",
        "Ian: Where's eve? What happened to her? ",
        "Andy: I don't know, not yet. ",
        "Ian: What do you mean not yet? ",
        "Andy: That's all they found. There was no sign of her, no body. ",
        "Ian: Well, then she's fine. She walked away. ",
        "Andy: Look, look, just -- ",
        "ian: What? ",
        "Andy: Listen to me. The car was totalled. It's more than 100 feet down from \r\nthe road to where they spotted the wreck. No one could have survived that crash.\r\n",
        "Ian: But you just said -- ",
        "andy: Look -- no one. I'm sorry. ",
        "Valerie: Just let me finish. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, you are finished we're fished. ",
        "Valerie: You made as much noise at the airport as I did. ",
        "Jamal: Valerie, i don't want to hear it. ",
        "Valerie: Jamal -- ",
        "jamal: Look, look -- I don't owe you a thing. Ok, we got no ties. ",
        "Valerie: That's not true. We have hope. You're right. My tie is to hope, not \r\nto you. Ok, me and ali, we went way out of our way for you. You won't budge an \r\ninch. Ok, you hang 24/7, you flash skin at me in my own place -- ",
        "valerie: All I did was get dressed. ",
        "Jamal: Strip down with the door open, valerie, wide open. You dissed ali and \r\nme. ",
        "Valerie: You? Never. ",
        "Jamal: I tell you that I'm going to go straighten things out with the \r\nhartmans, and you show up after I tell you I don't want you to go, valerie? \r\nThat's not flipping me off? ",
        "Valerie: Listen, I just wanted to see hope. ",
        "Jamal: Why don't you save it, valerie? Just save it, ok, because i don't care \r\nwhat you wanted, and I cannot trust you. ",
        "Valerie: But, jamal, you're all i've got. You and hope, that's it. ",
        "Jamal: Well, you lost us both now. Look, I got some cash stashed away, and \r\nwith your job and everything and the cash, you can put the first and last month \r\ndown on your own place. ",
        "Valerie: Right, stash me away in some hole and forget that i'm alive, right? \r\nYou're just so into this sweet little life you have going on with her, but \r\nyou're not getting away that easy. You have a daughter who needs you, and if you \r\nthink I'm going to let you let her go, you're wrong. You're the only person who \r\ncan get the hartmans to give hope back legally. ",
        "Jamal: Look, valerie, if you think that I'm going to take her away from the \r\nhartmans, I'm not. ",
        "Valerie: We do this. You and I can raise her together. ",
        "Jamal: Finally -- ",
        "valerie: She's our daughter. ",
        "Jamal: Finally. Ali was right all along. ",
        "Valerie: About what? ",
        "Jamal: Val, you think -- you think that we're some kind of a family or \r\nsomething? You, me, and hope? Well, guess what, valerie? It ain't happening, ok? \r\nAnd it ain't going to happen. You got that? Get it through your head, valerie -- \r\nnot now, not ever. ",
        "Rafe: What is this stuff, anyway? ",
        "Alison: It's syrups and jams and molasses for my muffins for the holidays.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Oh. I'll replace it. ",
        "Alison: No, that's ok. ",
        "Rafe: I promise. ",
        "Alison: Well, you could just help me with the baking, I guess. I'm sure that \r\nyou make a really mean angel's food cake. Oh. Oh, goss gracious. I'm so sorry. I \r\napologize about that. ",
        "Rafe: No -- no you're not. You did that on purpose. ",
        "Alison: Ah! Oh, my god. ",
        "Rafe: No, ok, ok -- all right, all right, all right, all right -- truce, \r\ntruce. ",
        "Alison: Fine, fine, fine. ",
        "Rafe: You win, ok? ",
        "Alison: Ok, but only if you answer me one question. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, fine. Go ahead. ",
        "Alison: Ok. You have been blowing me off for days, seems like, and I just \r\nwant to know the real reason. You know, I mean, I've been trying to, like, find \r\nyou and stuff, and i just -- ",
        "rafe: I know. ",
        "Alison: You know? Oh. Well, I mean, why? What -- what is the real reason? ",
        "Rafe: The real reason? Oh. Part of it you already know. I have a lot of work \r\nto do. And the other part is -- well, whenever you're around, my schedule just \r\ngets thrown off, you know -- i start having fun, you know, like when i did that \r\nlight show for the baby. ",
        "Alison: Right. Well, angels can't have fun? ",
        "Rafe: On assignment, no. And christmas is getting really close. ",
        "Alison: Well, I mean, you've already done so much already. Livvie called and \r\nher and jack are back together. And frank and karen, they seem really cozy, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, and chris and jack are even making some progress. ",
        "Alison: Ok, then, see? That's a miracle in itself. I mean, there's two \r\nbrothers that absolutely hated each other. You know? I mean, your plan is going \r\nas perfectly as you wanted it to, and I'm really grateful and I'm really proud \r\nof you and stuff. So -- ",
        "rafe: What's wrong? ",
        "Alison: Just -- I just remembered that you're going to be going back. On \r\nchristmas, you're going to leave for good. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you a lot. ",
        "Rafe: I'm going to miss you, too, alison. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Lucy, what are you doing? What are you doing? You're making a big \r\nmistake, that's what you're doing. If doc sees you here -- you should just turn \r\naround and get out of here before he does. I mean, he's just with a patient, \r\nthat's all. I trust him, and he's not seeing another woman. That's absolutely \r\nridiculous. Colleen? Hi. ",
        "Colleen: Hi, lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, I just was wondering when kevin was going to be finished with \r\nthat patient of his. You know, I was going to surprise him and maybe take him \r\nout for a bite to eat. ",
        "Colleen: Oh, that's a nice thought, but he's not here. ",
        "Lucy: He's not? ",
        "Colleen: No. Well, he was for a few minutes, but he signed himself out. Yeah, \r\nhere it is. His schedule's all clear. No more patients or appointments. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. ",
        "Colleen: Yeah. ",
        "Andy: Let me know st as soon as you can. Right. ",
        "Ian: Well? ",
        "Andy: Nothing yet. It may be a while, ian. That ravine is pretty tough going. \r\nLook, why don't I get a unit to take you home? ",
        "Ian: No, I'm going to stay right here. ",
        "Andy: But it could be a long -- ",
        "ian: I said i'm staying. ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "ian: God, eve, what have i done? ",
        "Ian's voice: Alan, hey. My wife's changed her mind. She wants to speak at \r\nyour conference. All right. See you at work. ",
        "Eve: What are you doing? ",
        "Ian: I -- i don't know. Just that's us getting back to normal. That's what we \r\nwant, right? ",
        "Eve: Right. ",
        "Ian: So let's do it, get back to being doctors, helping people, speaking at \r\nconferences. Here i thought we had all this time when we may not have any time \r\nat all. ",
        "Ian: Well, what? ",
        "Andy: I'm sorry, ian. Nothing yet. ",
        "Ian: Ok. I can't sit here anymore. I'm -- ",
        "andy: Look, I understand. We got a dozen guys -- ",
        "ian: I can't sit here anymore. ",
        "Andy: Listen to me, ian -- ",
        "ian: No, you listen to me. You either take me there or I'll go by myself -- \r\nI'll find it. I don't -- ",
        "eve: No, no, you get your hands off me! I'm fine! ",
        "Andy: Hey, would somebody please find out what the heck all that noise is \r\nabout? ",
        "Eve: That idiot who knocked me on the head and stole my car -- ",
        "ian: Eve! ",
        "Eve: Andy, I want that guy arrested. You have to find -- what are you -- ",
        "ian: Thank god you're -- ",
        "eve: What are you doing here? I -- hey. Are you -- ",
        "ian: I thought you were -- ",
        "eve: What? What? ",
        "Ian: The worst. I thought the worst. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Hey. It's ok. I'm fine. We're fine. We're fine. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, where are you? What are you hiding? You know, if you're hiding \r\nsomething from me, i wish you would just tell me. You know, I can take it. I -- \r\noh, my god. Oh, my goodness. I don't believe it. That louse. He gave that -- \r\nthat woman the scarf that i helped him pick out -- oh, no. No, doc -- please, \r\nno. ",
        "Valerie: Hope is our child, jamal. We are a family. ",
        "Jamal: No, we're not. ",
        "Valerie: There's nothing you can do to change that. ",
        "Jamal: And there's nothing you can do to make me love you. ",
        "Valerie: Please, jamal. ",
        "Jamal: I don't love you, valerie. ",
        "Valerie: Maybe we can try to work this out. Maybe we -- ",
        "jamal: No, no, we can't and we won't. ",
        "Valerie: But we -- we have a beautiful little girl together. ",
        "Jamal: I cannot believe this. You really are crazy. ",
        "Valerie: No, jamal. ",
        "Jamal: There is no life for us, valerie. No future. ",
        "Rafe: You have a bright future ahead of you, alison. ",
        "Alison: How do you know? ",
        "Rafe: I know. ",
        "Alison: Can you really see into my future? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. And I'm going to keep a watch on you to make sure it stays as \r\nbright as can be -- you know, filled with all the love, warmth, and kindness \r\nthat you give to everyone. ",
