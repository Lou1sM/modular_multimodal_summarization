I said what I mean, and, you know, when I say that, you have to understand i mean what i say when I say what i mean, and I just said that. I mean what I said, so why -- why are you confused?

", "Alison: You know? Oh. Well, I mean, why? What -- what is the real reason? ", "Rafe: The real reason? Oh. Part of it you already know. I have a lot of work to do. And the other part is -- well, whenever you're around, my schedule just gets thrown off, you know -- i start having fun, you know, like when i did that light show for the baby. ", "Alison: Right. Well, angels can't have fun? ", "Rafe: On assignment, no. And christmas is getting really close. ", "Alison: Well, I mean, you've already done so much already.

You're making a big mistake, that's what you're doing. If doc sees you here -- you should just turn around and get out of here before he does. I mean, he's just with a patient, that's all. I trust him, and he's not seeing another woman. That's absolutely ridiculous. Colleen? Hi. ", "Colleen: Hi, lucy. ", "Lucy: Listen, I just was wondering when kevin was going to be finished with that patient of his. You know, I was going to surprise him and maybe take him out for a bite to eat.
