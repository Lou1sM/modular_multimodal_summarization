        "Frank: I wouldn't have offered if I weren't. Now, get out of here before I \r\nchange my mind or Mom shows up. ",
        "Joe: Okay, okay, I'm going. But if anybody needs me -- ",
        "Frank: I know -- you're just a phone call away. Yes, I've got Gabby's number \r\nand her cell and yours. ",
        "Joe: All right, all right. And if Mom asks -- ",
        "Frank: Joe, don't worry. I know the plan. ",
        "Joe: Okay, I'm gone. ",
        "Frank: Okay. ",
        "Joe: Frank? ",
        "Frank: Yeah? ",
        "Joe: Thanks. I just want these couple of days with Gabby to be perfect, you \r\nknow? ",
        "Frank: How could they not be? ",
        "Joe: Yeah, you're right. What could go wrong? ",

        "Lucy: \"There is a 99.9% probability that the victims in the car wreckage do \r\nnot match Eve Lambert and Ian Thornhart.\" They didn't die. They didn't die in \r\nthe explosion. They're alive. They're alive. ",
        "Lucy's voice: So they weren't in Ian's car, only Eve's wedding rings were. \r\nBut how could the rings be there and Eve not be, unless -- oh, they planned the \r\nwhole thing to make it look like they died when that bomb exploded so they could \r\nrun away together without anybody knowing. Only now once this comes out, \r\neverybody will know. Oh, no. It'll rip Doc apart if he finds out the truth from \r\na report. I have to tell him. I'll just find the right way to do it and just the \r\nright time. But in the meantime, nobody can see this report. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Wait. I'll prove there's not enough poison to kill you. ",
        "Eve: Ian, don't. ",
        "Harris: You're either insane -- ",
        "Ian: Or telling the truth. That poison will attack the parasite, not you. ",
        "Harris: Still, I'll wait for my dose until after you recover from yours. ",
        "Ian: Just get out. ",
        "Harris: I'll leave you to your suffering. If he dies -- ",
        "Eve: You'll be the first to know. ",
        "Harris: I have found the perfect team to save my life -- Ian, the true hero, \r\nand Eve -- she's beautiful and smart. The perfect man and woman, absolutely. I \r\nhave no -- I have no doubt. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Get your hands off me. And don't expect me to lift a finger to help you \r\nuntil I know that he's all right. ",
        "Harris: That's understandable. ",
        "Eve: Don't ever touch me again. ",
        "Harris: If I do? ",
        "Ian: Get out, Harris. Hanging over our shoulder is not going to help us do \r\nour best work. ",
        "Harris: I never thought I would be in a position where I hoped you'd live. In \r\nthis circumstance, surprisingly enough, I do. ",
        "Eve: Are you crazy? The whole point of taking that dose of poison was to kill \r\na parasite. ",
        "Ian: I know what the point was. ",
        "Eve: Yes, but you don't have a parasite, therefore we don't know what this is \r\ngoing to do to you. What were you thinking? ",
        "Ian: I was thinking I should stop him before he puts a knife in you. ",
        "Eve: Really? Do you really think he was going to kill me, Ian? ",
        "Ian: I didn't want to take that chance. ",
        "Eve: Oh, man. Fine. You know, what Harris said about you is true. You always \r\nhave to be the hero. ",
        "Ian: Only when it matters. ",
        "Eve: You drank poison, Ian. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, but not enough to kill me. ",
        "Eve: You don't know that. ",
        "Ian: Sure I do. ",
        "Eve: No, you don't. ",

        "Frank: Mom. Thanks. ",
        "Mary: Well, what are you doing here? I thought Joe was going to hang the \r\nlights. You just got off your shift, didn't you? ",
        "Frank: Well, it's Christmas, and you know how I get around the holidays. In \r\nfact, why don't you take the night off, go out to dinner with Victor, and I'll \r\ncover this place. ",
        "Mary: Oh. What about Neil? ",
        "Frank: He's with Courtney. I had to give her some time with him. It is \r\nChristmas, and she's his mom. ",
        "Mary: And your brother? ",
        "Frank: What about him? ",
        "Mary: Well, where is he? ",

        "Mary: He said he was going to be here. ",

        "Frank: I don't know what you mean. ",
        "Mary: Just tell me what's wrong with Joe. What are you hiding? ",
        "Frank: Nothing. ",
        "Mary: Oh, my God. Did he take another H.I.V. test? Is he positive? ",
        "Frank: No, no. Mom, no. Stop. He doesn't take another test for months. Joe is \r\nfine. Look, he's a grown man, and what he does is his own business. ",
        "Mary: He's with Gabriela, isn't he? ",
        "Frank: Did I mention he's an adult? ",
        "Mary: No, I know he's an adult, she's an adult, and they have feelings for \r\neach other. But I worry so much about the fact that he could -- ",
        "Frank: Mom. ",
        "Mary: Now, don't you dare, Francis Xavier Scanlon, try to tell me not to \r\nworry about one of my sons when you know darn well that's what I do best. ",

        "Kevin: How did you find me, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: I know you very well. I'm really glad, you know, you came here. ",
        "Kevin: Instead of drowning my sorrows in some bar? ",
        "Lucy: I didn't say that. ",
        "Kevin: You didn't have to. I know what you meant. ",
        "Lucy: So, what's in the bag? ",
        "Kevin: I emptied out Eve's locker. ",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. Did anything show up that might help in the investigation?\r\n",
        "Kevin: No, but the D.N.A. results should be back any minute. I guess I came \r\ndown here to prepare for the inevitable. I already know what the report will \r\nsay, but I guess it just makes it official somehow. I've also been thinking a \r\nlot about what you said. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I said a lot of things. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, you did, but one of the things you said was to remember the good \r\ntimes. And there were a lot of good times with Eve. She touched a lot of people, \r\nLucy. And as for that note that Ian wrote -- so what if he had a thing for my \r\nwife? Who wouldn't? She was an incredible woman. And I should know because I'm \r\nthe man that she loved. ",
        "Lucy: Listen, Doc, there's something I really -- I need to tell you, and it's \r\nabout Eve. ",

        "Ian: I know what I'm doing. Just trust me, okay? Now, don't try this at home. \r\nI'm a professional. ",
        "Eve: I'm a professional, too. Give me your wrist. ",
        "Ian: Oh, come on. There's no need for that. ",
        "Eve: Ian -- ",

        "Eve: Ok, just stop talking and save your breath. ",
        "Ian: Shh. Can you please go work on something? I'm doing my part, now you do \r\nyours. God! ",
        "Eve: Ian! Ian! ",
        "Ian: I don't want you here! ",
        "Eve: No, too bad. I'm not leaving. I won't let you go through this alone. I \r\nwon't. ",
        "Ian: Will you stop fussing at me? ",
        "Eve: Hey, I just want to help you, okay? ",
        "Ian: All right. Get me a glass of Irish and be done with it. ",
        "Eve: How about a free checkup instead? ",
        "Ian: I don't need a checkup. I drank enough poison to kill a parasite, not a \r\nman. But it still has to work its way through me, so you may want to stay away \r\nso you don't get bit. ",
        "Eve: Did anyone ever tell you you make a lousy patient? ",
        "Ian: Oh, and proud of it. ",
        "Eve: Well, I'm too good a doctor to sit around here and watch you suffer. \r\nHey, open up! We got a medical condition in here. ",
        "Man: What's the problem? ",

        "Kevin: There's nothing you can tell me, good or bad. Everything I need to \r\nknow about Eve I know already. ",
        "Lucy: Are you sure? ",
        "Kevin: I'm sure. Lucy, it was easier feeling angry than it was to feel how \r\nmuch it hurt. It was easier thinking that she wasn't faithful than how much I \r\nmiss her. But finally I listened to my heart, and Eve never would have betrayed \r\nme. And that's what's getting me through this -- just remembering her love. ",
        "Lucy: I'm very glad that you're finding a way to make peace with what's \r\nhappened -- ",
        "Kevin: The next step in that is the D.N.A. report. I'm going to see if it's \r\nin. ",
        "Lucy: No, you know what, Doc? You look so relaxed and peaceful. Why don't you \r\njust stay here and enjoy the quiet, and I'll go check on it. I'll come right \r\nback when I -- ",
        "Kevin: No, no, no, no. Thanks for the offer, but this is something I should \r\ndo myself. ",

        "Kevin: I'll be right back. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, thanks. Hurry. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't swallow wrong, okay? It \r\nwas just -- it was a little white lie. I apologize in here, in the chapel. But \r\nlisten, you got to help me here. I know I swore -- I promised that I wouldn't \r\nget involved. You know, I told Scott I wouldn't. But this is Kevin. Don't you \r\nsee what he just said? You heard it. You heard it. Of course, this is your \r\nhouse. You heard what he said. He said that he trusted Eve and he knows Eve \r\nwould never betray him. So don't you see I cannot let him know that that woman \r\nhe married ran off with -- with Ian. Okay, so we have to fix this. Do you see? \r\nHe can't see that report. So let's just concentrate, put our heads together \r\nhere, and we can work it out so no one ever has to see that report. Are you with \r\nme? Okay. Be with me. ",
