        "Alison: Ah, look, there's \r\nJamal. This might be a good time to talk to him about you know what. ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: Our wedding. So, this \r\nis your last chance to stop me or forever hold your peace. ",
        "Rafe: No, it's ok. Go ahead.\r\n",
        "Alison: Are you sure? Ok. You \r\ncan come with me if you want. Or -- or I could just -- I'll do it by myself. \r\nI'll do it by myself. Ok. Hey. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Alison: Can I buy you a beer?\r\n",
        "Jamal: Of course. What's going \r\non? ",
        "Alison: I wanted to -- to talk \r\nto you about my wedding.\r\n\n",
        "Jamal: Oh, to -- ",
        "Alison: Yes, to Rafe. \n",
        "Jamal: Rafe. That's right.\r\n",
        "Alison: It's still Rafe. \n",
        "Jamal: Just playing. \n",
        "(Rafe thinking)",
        "Alison: There actually must be \r\nsomething to that water that Stephen makes her drink. ",
        "Rafe: What are you talking \r\nabout? What water? ",
        "Alison: I don't know. Some \r\ndesigner water. It's a rock star thing. Supposedly it has all the electrolytes \r\nand vitamins in it. She swears by it. ",
        "Rafe: How long has she been \r\ndrinking it? ",
        "Alison: I don't know. A while. \r\nI'm surprised you haven't noticed. ",
        "Rafe: Now that you mention it, \r\nI have.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Uh-huh, those little \r\nblue bottles. They never leave home without them. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, what's in that water? \r\nHey, man. Hey. ",
        "Ricky: Hey. ",
        "Rafe: How's it going with the \r\nband? ",
        "Ricky: It's all good, man.\r\n",
        "Rafe: It's amazing. I mean, it \r\nmust feel like you won the lottery or something. I mean, one day you're a \r\nstruggling musician, the next day you're playing skins for one of the hottest \r\nbands going, huh? ",
        "Ricky: Look, if you want me to \r\nbuy you a beer, just ask, don't blow me any smoke. ",
        "Rafe: I'm -- I'm not blowing \r\nany smoke. I'm serious. I'm totally serious. Why don't you come over here. I'll \r\nbuy, all right?\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: You're asking me to sit \r\ndown so you can spew some of that vampire garbage at me, I'll tell you right \r\nnow, I'm not in the mood. ",
        "Rafe: All right, you know what? \r\nEven vampire slayers get the night off now and again. But I do have a couple \r\nquestions for you. ",
        "Ricky: All right, here we go. \r\nSee you. ",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, no, I \r\npromise, I promise, I promise. There will be no vampire talk. I just -- I want \r\nto know about this special water that Stephen and the band keep knocking back.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Water? What? That's your \r\nbig question? ",
        "Rafe: Well, here's the thing. I \r\nhaven't told many people, but I'm going to be opening up a gym soon.\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: What does water have \r\nanything to do with it? ",
        "Rafe: Well, I hear that it's \r\nsupposed to be kind of a wonder water, so I thought maybe I could sell it at the \r\ngym. Think you can get me a bottle? ",
        "",
        "Lucy: How could you say \r\nsomething so hurtful to me, to say that Kevin would beat up some prostitute and \r\nthen come home and make love to me, huh? How? ",
        "Ian: I didn't say it to be \r\nhurtful. ",
        "Lucy: What was your intention? \r\nThen why did you say it? ",
        "Ian: I wanted you to open your \r\neyes. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I think they're open. \r\nMission accomplished, doctor. ",
        "Ian: I know you feel an \r\nobligation to this man. I understand.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: I love him! ",
        "Ian: Ok. Whatever it is, \r\nwhatever it is that you two have -- whatever that is, maybe it's blinding you to \r\nwhat's going on here. ",
        "Andy: Sorry, doc, but I can't \r\nbring Kevin in without some hard evidence. ",
        "Lucy: He's free to go? He can \r\ngo? ",
        "Andy: Yes. ",
        "Jack: Tess, I'm sorry you had \r\nto wait for me. What's wrong? Did something happen? ",
        "Ian: Andy, do me a favor. I \r\nknow you have your rules and regulations, but just hang out a little longer. If \r\nshe comes through, maybe -- maybe she can explain something. ",
        "Andy: From what you docs are \r\nsaying, it doesn't look like she's going to make it.\r\n\n",
        "Chris: Excuse me. Detective, I \r\nthink you might want to step inside. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh, it's -- it's \r\na miracle. ",
        "Ian: It certainly appears to be \r\njust that. ",
        "Chris: How else would you \r\nexplain such a complete recovery? ",
        "Andy: So it's ok if I ask her a \r\nfew questions? ",
        "Chris: I don't see why not. \r\nExcuse me. ",
        "Andy: I'm Detective Capelli. I \r\nknow you've been through a lot, but there's one question I want to ask you. Is \r\nthis man, Dr. Kevin Collins, the person who attacked you? ",

        "",
        "Jamal: So, wait, let me guess. \r\nYou and your boy want to borrow one of the phattest rides I got in the shop to \r\nride off into the sunset after you guys tie the knot, yeah? Is that about it?\r\n\n",
        "Alison: No, no. But that's -- \r\nthat's a very good idea. ",
        "Jamal: No, because, I mean, I'm \r\ncool with it if you want to, ok? Because nobody looks better than you on the \r\nback of a bike. ",
        "Alison: Thank you very much. \r\nBut it would really mean a lot to me if -- well, it wouldn't be my wedding \r\nunless you were there. ",
        "Jamal: Sweetie, don't worry. \r\nI'm there for you. ",
        "Alison: No, I don't want you \r\njust at the wedding. Jamal, I want you to stand up for me. ",
        "Jamal: I will stand up for you. \r\nI told you. Don't even ask me twice. I got your back. You know that. ",
        "Alison: I want you to stand up \r\nin the wedding.\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Rafe: Just one bottle. Just one \r\nbottle. That's all I'm asking for. I just want to see what all the fuss is \r\nabout. ",
        "Ricky: There's no fuss. It's \r\njust water. ",
        "Rafe: Whoa. No, no, no, no, no. \r\nSee, that's the thing. Water isn't just water anymore. It's gone totally \r\nhigh-tech. They take it, and they put in all these antioxidants and electrolytes \r\nand all that kind of stuff. And the more stuff they put in there, the more \r\nsomebody pays for that little bottle of water. ",
        "Ricky: So why don't you buy one \r\nfor yourself? ",
        "Rafe: I would do that, but \r\nthere's no label on it. I think Stephen probably has it manufactured himself.\r\n",
        "Ricky: So you want me to steal \r\none?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: No. No, this isn't about \r\nthat. It's not, really, really. I just want to try it. And if I like it, I will \r\nthen go to Stephen and see if it's ok if I market it at the gym. ",
        "Ricky: I repeat myself -- you \r\nwant me to steal the water from my boss, Stephen Clay. ",
        "Rafe: Well, you know, I hear \r\nyou're pretty good at that kind of stuff. Look, your name will never come up, \r\nall right? ",
        "Ricky: Look, it's not that. \r\nIt's just that Stephen has a way of going postal over weird stuff like this, all \r\nright? And I do not want to lose my job. ",
        "Rafe: I'm just asking you to do \r\nme a little favor here. Stephen will never know that came from you. Please. Come \r\non. It's no big deal, right? Come on.\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: Look, I can't promise \r\nyou anything, all right? ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Ricky: I'll see what I can do.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Thank you, thank you.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Here's my little \r\ndrummer boy. ",
        "Ricky: Hi. ",

        "Ricky: What are you doing here?\r\n",
        "Livvie: Looking for you. \n",
        "Ricky: Because? ",
        "Livvie: Because I thought since \r\nwe didn't get to finish our date that maybe, in the Christmas spirit, you could \r\ncome back to my place. ",
        "Ricky: And? ",
        "Livvie: And I'll cook you some \r\ndinner, and you could deck my halls. ",
        "Ricky: Hmm. It's -- it's not a \r\ngood idea, ok? I mean, I just didn't like the way that Stephen looked at me the \r\nlast time he saw us together.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Oh, come on. I mean, \r\nwho cares about Stephen? He's not your boss. ",
        "Ricky: Oh, he is my boss. I'm \r\nnot losing this job. ",
        "Livvie: All right. Look, I know \r\nhow much this job means to you. But you know what? You have got your own private \r\nlife, and what you do in your private life is none of Stephen's concern. Just \r\nyou and me, ok? Just us. And what we do together is absolutely nobody's \r\nbusiness. ",
        "Ricky: Oh, God, it's still \r\nrisky, Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Well, trust me, I'm \r\nworth the risk. ",

        "Jack: What are you -- what are \r\nyou talking about? What happened? ",
        "Chris: Jack, she was amazing. \r\nAbsolutely amazing. I'm off work in just a few minutes. Let me buy you guys \r\ndrink, and we can talk. ",
        "Jack: A drink? Chris, we \r\nbrought Tess here because she's been having really bad headaches. This isn't the \r\nfirst time. She can barely see straight. ",
        "Chris: I'm sorry. I had no \r\nidea. Jack, I got to tell you, it was unbelievable. We had this woman in the E.R., \r\nAnd she was at death's door. We had done everything we could. Tess saved her. \r\nJack, she did it again. I mean, she brought this woman back to life.\r\n\n",
        "Jack: You used Tess to save \r\nsomeone else's life? ",
        "Chris: No, not at all. \n",

        "Andy: Did Dr. Collins beat you \r\nup? ",
        "Jenny: Not this time. This time \r\nit was Benny. ",
        "Andy: Who's Benny? ",

        "Andy: You heard what the lady \r\nsaid, doc. It wasn't Kevin. Dr. Collins, thank you for your time.\r\n\n",

        "Chris: Did she always get the \r\nheadaches? ",
        "Jack: No, not at first. She -- \r\nwell, not until she came to Port Charles. She started seeing things, and that's \r\nwhen it kind of started. And, well, it definitely got worse when she started \r\nseeing people. ",
