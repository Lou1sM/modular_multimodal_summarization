        "Joe: You're so beautiful. So beautiful. ",
        "Gabriela: Joe, I don't want to wait anymore. Make love to me. Now. Now. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I spoke to Mac again. He says the DNA report will be up on the \r\ncomputer any minute. ",
        "Lucy: Really? That fast? ",
        "Kevin: Fast. I feel like I've been waiting for this forever. Lucy, I know I \r\nsaid I wanted to go through this myself, but I really could use a friend to be \r\nhere when it comes in. So if you're not in a rush, could you hang just for a \r\nwhile? I'd appreciate it. ",
        "Lucy: Sure, Doc. Of course I will do that. Of course. ",
        "Lucy's Voice: \"There is a 99.9% probability the victims in the car wreckage \r\ndo not match Eve Lambert and Ian Thornhart.\" They didn't die. They didn't die in \r\nthe explosion. They're alive. He said that he trusted Eve and he knows Eve would \r\nnever betray him. So don't you see? I cannot let him know that that woman \r\nhe married ran off with Ian. ",
        "Lucy: You know, I -- I sure could use a cup of coffee. I bet you could, too. \r\nYou want to go and get a cup of coffee? Better idea. Why don't you go get us a \r\ncouple of cups and I'll just stay here and wait till the news comes in, ok? ",
        "Colleen: Thanks for keeping an eye on things, Lucy. Hi, Dr. Collins. ",
        "Kevin: Colleen. ",
        "Colleen: Ah -- did the computer reboot yet? ",
        "Kevin: Were you having trouble with it? ",
        "Colleen: Yeah, somebody accidentally unplugged it. ",
        "Lucy: You know, I could use that coffee, Doc. Hey, what do you say we go run \r\nand get a cup? ",
        "Kevin: Actually, I think I'll pass. I'd like to get this over with as soon as \r\npossible. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. But listen -- take it from somebody who's had a lot of bad news \r\nlately -- Doc, I'm really afraid this is going to hit you a lot harder than you \r\nthink. ",
        "",
        "Eve: No! I'm not leaving him! ",
        "Harris: You're in no position to be making demands. ",
        "Eve: Fine. Ok, I know that you don't care if he dies. ",
        "Harris: Hmm. ",
        "Eve: But I thought that you might want to be around longer -- to plunder and \r\npillage. So if you just let me monitor Ian, the way the poison is affecting his \r\nbody, for your sake. We're trying to help you. ",
        "Harris: Nice, appealing to my well developed sense of survival. But I see \r\nright through you, Eve. You just -- you just want to be with your friend. ",
        "Eve: He's sick. He needs me. ",
        "Harris: Then maybe we can come to terms. After all, you did once put a price \r\non your services. ",
        "Eve: Fine. If that's the way you want to play it, fine. Although, I always \r\nestablished my terms up front. So, what kind of a deal are you offering? ",
        "",
        "Jamal: Listen, I got to split. First day at my new gig, and Alison's been \r\ngiving me the third degree about it. But you know me. I got her off track real \r\nfast. ",
        "Frank: I still think it's a mistake not telling Alison what you're really \r\ndoing. ",
        "Jamal: Come on. All I'm doing is getting some extra money so I can give her a \r\ngood Christmas. All right, that's all I'm doing. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, but the way you're doing it. ",
        "Jamal: Look, just keep it on the D.L., would you? Can you? ",
        "Frank: Why bother? Alison's a born snoop. She's bound to figure you out. ",
        "Jamal: There's no way Alison's going to find out about this. ",
        "Alison: I'm not going to find out what? ",
        "",
        "Joe: You're everything I've ever wanted, Gabby. I can't stop thinking about \r\nyou. ",
        "Gabriela: Steamy thoughts? ",
        "Joe: Purely X-rated. ",
        "Gabriela: I want to share everything with you, Joe. I feel so close to you. I \r\nwant to feel closer. ",
        "Gabriela: I'm so glad this is something we decided we could do. ",
        "Joe: Gabby, wait. We can't go through with it. ",
        "Gabriela: What? ",
        "",
        "Ian: Harris! Take your hands off her. ",
        "Eve: Ian, please don't let him hurt me! ",
        "Harris: You're mine now, body and soul. All mine. ",
        "Ian: Eve! I can't get you, Eve. Eve! ",
        "Harris: You can't protect Eve anymore. She's mine forever. ",
        "Eve: Ian? Ian, where are you? Ah! Ian, help me! Ian -- Ian, help me! Help me! \r\nIan! ",
        "Ian: I can't get to you. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Talk fast. What's this deal you want to make? ",
        "Harris: You're a smart girl. I think you know. I want what Thornhart wants \r\nbut can't have. I want you. ",
        "Eve: Somehow I thought you'd be more original. ",
        "Harris: Oh, don't look so glum. This is a win-win proposition. ",
        "Eve: What do I get out of this proposition? ",
        "Harris: You get to go in and hold Ian's hand. He's burning with fever right \r\nnow. He may die tonight. You want to be with him. I can give you that. But if my terms seem \r\nunreasonable to you, then we can negotiate further over a bottle of champagne. ",
        "Eve: There isn't time for that, all right? Just let me go in there and get \r\nIan through this. And then -- and then I'll give you what you want. All right? \r\nI'll do whatever it takes. You have my word. ",
        "",
        "Colleen: Finally, the system's back up. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc, you know, I think you need to think about this. Seeing this \r\nreport, you know, it might hit you a lot harder than you think. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Eve's dead. What could be more traumatic than that? And seeing \r\nthis report isn't going to change that. ",
        "[Elevator bell rings] ",

        "Victor: What a surprise. We're just going to spread some Christmas cheer \r\namong the patients' rooms. Would you like to join us? ",
        "Kevin: Actually, any other time would be fine, Victor, but I'm waiting for \r\nthe DNA results to come in. ",
        "Victor: Well, then I'm glad I'm here. I'll just send my friends to the room, \r\nand I'll stay here with you. ",
        "Kevin: Good. ",
        "Colleen: Who's got time for Christmas? I've got a million files to file -- \r\nshould've been filed yesterday -- and Mrs. Koslov in 602 is screaming for her \r\nrelease papers. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, poor Mrs. Koslov. You know what? That caroling just put me in the \r\nChristmas spirit. I'm your little elf. I will stay here while you take care of \r\nyour patients again, and I will man the station. ",
        "Colleen: Lucy, you don't have to do this again. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah, I love to give, to G.H. especially, so go. Go with the wind.\r\n",
        "Colleen: Thank you, Lucy. ",

        "Jamal: You see, now you're going to spoil it. I mean, Christmas is right \r\naround the corner and -- you know, I don't know, there might be a certain \r\nsomebody that I'm shopping for. Keep acting like you know it all. Listen, I got \r\nto roll. ",
        "Alison: Oh, right. Listen -- about that mysterious job there, Jamal -- ",
        "Jamal: Look, I told you to stop trippin' about it, all right? Just stop. ",
        "Alison: I just thought that maybe you would want a good-luck kiss, that's \r\nall. ",
        "Jamal: All right. ",

        "Jamal: Yeah, right. ",
        "Frank: Shouldn't you be getting back to work, too? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, eventually. Um -- Frank, listen. Has Jamal said anything to \r\nyou, like any details about his new job? I mean, you don't think that he could \r\nbe doing anything iffy, do you? ",
        "Frank: No. Jamal's cool. Nothing to worry about. ",
        "Alison: Right, yeah. Cool. All right, then. So do you think that I should go \r\nall green or all glitter this year? ",
        "Frank: Excuse me? ",
        "Alison: Well, I just really want to give Jamal a Christmas that he'll never \r\nforget, you know? Perfect. When did tinsel get so expensive? ",
        "Frank: Since you started paying for it. ",
        "Alison: God, I guess. Ok, then. So there's only one thing for me to do. I'm \r\ngoing to have to get a second job. Ok, look, here's one that I can do. This is \r\nperfect for me. It screams me. \"Alison, come find me.\" ",
        "Frank: I'm afraid to look. ",
        "Alison: No, this will be perfect. With all the money that I will make from \r\nthis extra job, I will be able to make our apartment into the best winter \r\nwonderland ever. But don't tell Jamal, ok, because I want it to be a surprise. \r\nSo don't tell. ",

        "Gabriela: Unless you don't want this relationship the same way I do? ",
        "Joe: Oh, man. I want you more than anything else in the world. Why can't you \r\nget it through your head? If anything happened to you, I couldn't live with \r\nmyself. ",
