You offer her nothing, no present and definitel no future. So leave her alone, ok? Ok. Now, i only have a short time left to finish my mission here, so i got to get a grip. I've got to stop thinking about alison. That's not going to be easy. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: This place is magical. It brought us back together. ", "Livvie: Isn't it amazing? The two of us going off in different directions and it all happened to lead us right to this door. ", "Jack: Hey, i got a great idea. What do you say we rent this place out, huh? Make it our first home? ", "Livvie: Jack. Yes, i would love that! ", "Jack: Uh, who are you? What are you doing here? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Man: I happen to own this shack, so I'll ask the questions. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Karen: Frank? ", "Frank: Right here. ", "Karen: Did you see chris? ", "Frank: I'm taking you to the hospital. They'll help you. ", "Karen: No, no, only chris can help me. I need him. ", "Frank: He won't help. ", "Karen: What are you saying? ", "Frank: I'm saying, chris isn't going to help you. I talked to him. I begged him. He basically blew me off. ", "Karen: Chris is willing to let me die? ", "Frank: Ok. Ok, I'll get him, I swear, if i have to drag him here by his scrawny, little neck. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door] ", "chris: \"Scrawny,\" frank? You really should do something about controlling that temper of yours. Now, where's my patient? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: Ok, you know what? Show's over. ", "Alison: Rafe, rafe, wait. What's wrong? ", "Rafe: Nothing. Nothing, ok? I am -- I have to go. Bye. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Ahem. ", "Alison: Oh. Jamal. Hi. I was just thinking about you. ", "Jamal: Morning. ", "Alison: Morning. ", "Jamal: Where is miss valerie? ", "Alison: She went to go get some breakfast. Yeah. Listen, I was wondering if maybe we could spend some time alone together today. You know, I thought maybe we could just play hooky, just the two of us. ", "Jamal: I'm really swamped. I was hoping to actually take you out last night, but you came home so late. Where were you at, baby girl? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "livvie: Sir, we're very sorry. We didn't think anyone lived here. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Man: Well, I don't anymore, but I own the property. I'm about to call the cops and tell them I got a couple of squatters here. ", "Jack: Oh, no, no, no. We're not squatters, sir. We just kind of ended up here. ", "Man: All right. I won't charge you a night's rent if you get out right now. Last thing i need is somebody tripping over something and suing me. ", "Jack: No, we'd never do that. Actually, we were thinking about renting the place. ", "Man: Sorry, it's already sold. You are standing on the future site of the newest burger barn. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Woman: I'll have what he's having, only with vodka. And lean on it. ", "Rafe: It's a little early, isn't it? ", "Woman: Not if you had my life, kid. ", "Rafe: Come on, it can't be that bad. ", "Woman: Let's see -- no family, no children, and a husband who doesn't know i'm alive. I'd say that's three good reasons to drink, you know? ", "Rafe: Must've been different sometime in your life. ", "Woman: You know, they tell you that there's happily ever after. Believe me, that's just in fairy tales. I don't even believe in love anymore, you know? ", "Rafe: You did once, though, didn't you? ", "Woman: Yeah, sure. Well, didn't everybody? ", "Rafe: Well, some of us -- some people never get the chance, you know? What you had was a gift. Maybe you just lost it. Maybe you and your husband just need to find it again. ", "Woman: Well, that'd take a miracle. ", "Rafe: Well, 'tis the season. ", "Woman: 'Tis the season. It's these damn holidays. You know, when tom and i were first married and we were young, I used to look forward to them. And now it's -- it's all gone, finished. ", "Victor: Here you are. ", "Rafe: Here. ", "Woman: Thanks. ", "Victor: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Let me get you another one. ", "Woman: No, no, no, that's ok. No, really, I don't -- no, I'm fine. Why is it, all of a sudden i feel like this great weight has been lifted off my shoulder and the knot in my stomach is gone. ", "Rafe: I don't know. Must've been some kind of miracle, huh? ", "Woman: I don't know. I -- you did that for me. No, no, no kidding. When we were talking, I felt this light going on, and now i see things a lot more clearly. ", "Rafe: Well, people can turn on the light all by themselves. Sometimes they just need a little help finding the switch. ", "Woman: Thanks. Thanks, and merry christmas. ", "Rafe: Merry christmas. ", "Victor: I got to tell you, that was really impressive. ", "Rafe: I just wish I could take my own advice. ", "Victor: Let me take a wild guess -- this wouldn't have anything to do with a girl, would it? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: You were with rafe? ", "Alison: Well, yeah. You know, we were just sort of dropping off a baby gift, that's all. And what is with all the questions, anyway? ", "Jamal: I don't know. It sounds a little shady if you ask me, like rafe is working overtime to come up with reasons just to hang with you or something. ", "Alison: Oh, jamal, that is not true. Rafe is not interested in me. He's already committed. I already told you that. ", "Jamal: Ok, so where's this girl? What, some chick back in transylvania? I mean, maybe it's out of sight, out of mind with him. ", "Alison: No, he's not like that, ok? ", "Jamal: Well, it sounds like you know him pretty well. ", "Alison: Oh, ok. ", "Alison: Oh, good. See? Doughnuts. ", "Valerie: My version of breakfast. ", "Alison: Yeah. ", "Jamal: And you are trying to change the subject. ", "Alison: What? I don't even remember what the subject was. ", "Jamal: Ali, you know what i was talking about, ok? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Phone rings] ", "jamal: Hello? Hey, any luck? You got it? Ok, ok, ok. Go ahead. Uh-huh. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. That was dara. She found the hartmans. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Valerie: Yes! ", "Jamal: They're in chicago. ", "Valerie: We found our baby girl! We found hope! Oh, we got to catch the next flight out. We have to. I can't wait to see her. ", "Jamal: Hold up, val. I was actually planning to see the hartmans myself. Dara drew up some papers for me. ", "Valerie: What kind of papers? What are you talking about? ", "Jamal: I am giving up my parental rights. ", "Valerie: This was all your doing, wasn't it? You convinced jamal to give up his baby? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jack: Sir, you cannot let them turn this place into a burger barn. ", "Livvie: No, that would be a crime. ", "Jack: They'll tear it down. ", "Man: Well, that's the point. ", "Livvie: Well, this place has character, history. ", "Man: Rats, mildew, a second mortgage. Look, the company's giving me much more money than this dump is worth and i'm taking it, end of rort. ", "Jack: Well, we have money. ", "Livvie: Yeah. ", "Jack: You can sell it to us. ", "Livvie: Right, sell it to us. Look, we'll match whatever they offer. ", "Jack: Yeah. ", "Man: Ok. Can you -- can you match this amount of money? ", "Jack: Um -- yeah. Yeah, we can talk to a bank. ", "Man: You know, you two seem like a nice couple of kids. I was a kid once, too. My wife and I, this was our first house. And now we're divorcing. ", "Jack: Yeah, but you were happy here once, right? And maybe you can pass that on to us, give us that chance, too. ", "Livvie: Yes. So, please, sir -- we are putting our lives back together and we'll put this place back together. And I promise you that we will fill it with love again. ", "Man: Ok. All right. No. No, no, no, no. I appreciate you enthusiasm, but I just can't. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Woman: Why not, tom? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tom: Maggie. I thought you would be at your lawyer's office. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maggie: Tom, don't these kids remind you of anybody? We were never as happy as we were when we lived here. Give them the house, tom. Make them as happy as we used to be. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rafe: I don't care what you say. My problems aren't about a woman, victor.", "Victor: You could've fooled me. I can usually pick 'em. ", "Rafe: Anyway, it's not what you think, ok? ", "Victor: At least i didn't make a bet. ", "Rafe: Right. You know, but I do have this friend. ", "Victor: Really? And your friend -- what about your friend? ", "Rafe: Well, there's this guy -- you don't know him. And he's been spending a lot of time with this really beautiful girl. ", "Victor: I'd say he's a pretty lucky guy. ", "Rafe: Well, see, here's where it gets tricky. This girl, she's involved with someone else. ", "Victor: Oh. And they seem happy? ", "Rafe: Well, they have their problems, but yeah, they love each other a lot.", "Victor: Let me see if I got this straight. This girl loves her fellow, but is perfectly willing to spend time with your friend, who -- ", "rafe: Who happens to be a -- magician who tries to dazzle her every chance he gets. ", "Victor: A showoff? ", "Rafe: No, he's not a showoff. He -- yeah, maybe. A little bit. See, this guy, he's never felt this way before. Every time he's around her he just feels magic happening to him, so it just -- it flows out of him, you know? ", "Victor: Well, all's fair in love and war. And if he's half as good at talking about his feelings as you are talking about yours, I'd say he's got a -- quite a good shot. ", "Rafe: Yeah, but here's the thing -- this guy, he can't stay in town much longer. He's got to move on to another assignment. ", "Victor: Wait a minute. Wait -- you're telling me this guy could conceivably break up this girl's relationship without being able to offer her anything in return? ", "Rafe: That about sums it up. ", "Victor: Well, this is a no-brainer, rafe. I mean, you must've guessed that.", "Rafe: My friend should do the right thing and stay away from her, right? ", "Victor: Bingo. ", "Rafe: Yeah. I knew that was the answer. Just kind of hoping there was another one. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jamal: Why don't you back up off of ali? Ok, this was all my idea. ", "Valerie: How could you sign away the rights to your own flesh and blood? That was the only leverage we had against the hartmans. ", "Jamal: Leverage? This is not about leverage, valerie. ", "Valerie: What's it about, then? Giving up? If you surrender your rights, they can keep hope away from us forever. ", "Jamal: Look, I don't want my kid growing up in some kind of tug of war. And I don't want my kid living on the run because the hartmans are so afraid of losing her that they can't settle down. All I want is for hope to have a normal family and a normal life. That's it. ", "Valerie: We can give her that. ", "Jamal: Look, I know you love hope, valerie. That's why i believe a part of you understands what I'm saying is right. ", "Valerie: And you think it's right to turn your back on your own child? ", "Alison: That is not what he's saying, valerie. You're not even listening to him. ", "Valerie: You brainwashed jamal, didn't you? ", "Alison: Oh -- ", "valerie: You made him think a kid would mess up this cozy, little love fest you have going on with him. ", "Alison: That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. I let you live in this house. Ok? I am supportive of jamal and this child. ", "Valerie: His child. And I don't see you telling him to fight for his daughter. ", "Jamal: Just stop, stop, stop! Would you just give us some time alone, please?", "Alison: Yes, we would like some privacy, valerie. ", "Jamal: Baby, I meant me and valerie. ", "Valerie: Yeah, after all, this does concern the two of us. ", "Jamal: Please? ", "Alison: Fine. Jamal, just make sure that's what you want. ", "Alison: What do you want, jamal? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Chris: There you go. You should start feeling better soon. Regular doses of the medication will have you up and around in no time. ", "Karen: Thank you. Frank said you weren't coming by. He said you bailed out on me. ", "Chris: Well, I have to admit, I was pretty upset after frank kicked in the door and punched me in my face. But -- i don't know, after a good night's sleep, I realized i can't punish you just because he has an anger management problem.", "Frank: Do you want me to apologize again? I'm sorry. Whatever it takes. ", "Chris: That's the spirit, frank, \"whatever it takes.\" Listen, you take good care of yourself, ok? Get some rest. I'm going to discuss some details of your medication with frank. ", "Karen: You came through, chris. I won't forget that. Right, frank? ", "Frank: Right. ", "Chris: Ok. Shall we? ", "Frank: I'm guessing you didn't ask me out here to talk about karen's medication. ", "Chris: You guessed right. This is about my fee. ", "Frank: Ok. How much? ", "Chris: You don't have that kind of money, frank. No, you see, the price of my services is going to be a lot steeper than that. The question is, will you pay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tom: There's something different about you, maggie. Something's changed. ", "Maggie: Well, I decided after so many years of blame and anger, it was time to have a merry christmas. ", "Tom: That's it. There it is right there. It's that smile, mags. I haven't seen that smile for a long time. ", "Maggie: Listen, on the way over here, i noticed that sal's is still open. ", "Tom: Sal's! ", "Maggie: Sal'S. ", "Tom: Do you remember sal's? ", "Maggie: Yeah. ", "Tom: I proposed to you there. ", "Maggie: You did. ", "Tom: Right around this time of year, remember? ", "Maggie: Oh, honey, let's go back there and see if it's like we remembered it.", "Tom: You got it. ", "Maggie: Oh. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Livvie: Um -- ", "[jack whistles] ", "livvie: Uh -- hi. ", "Jack: Hey. ", "Livvie: About the house? ", "Tom: You got it. ", "Livvie: Oh! ", "Tom: I think the world can live without another burger barn. ", "Maggie: Yeah. ", "Livvie: Thank you! ", "Jack: Ah! ", "Livvie: Jack, I can't believe it! ", "Jack: We have a house. We have a house. ", "Livvie: You know, jack, you are my home. You are where I feel safest and loved. ", "Jack: Welcome home. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Valerie: We're talking about our daughter, jamal. Once you sign away your rights, we can't undo this. ", "Jamal: Ok, so while i'm sitting up here trying to make up my mind on what kind of role i'd like to play in my daughter's life, what happens to her life?", "Valerie: There's not a doubt in my mind that one day you're going to regret giving up your daughter. There's this ache inside of you that just never goes away. ", "Jamal: No, this is not about me anymore. Or you. This is about some little girl that doesn't know me from adam. That calls another man her daddy that she loves very much. Who am i to take that away from her? ", "Valerie: I can see you've made up your mind. And there's nothing I can say to change that. ", "Jamal: That's the way it is. ", "Valerie: So then I just have to deal with this somehow. ", "Jamal: Look, I'm sorry, valerie. ", "Valerie: Oh, there is no way in hell I'm going to let you get away with this, jamal. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: Hey, rafe, you got a minute? ", "Rafe: Actually, no, I don'T. ", "Alison: Listen, every time i think that things are going to get better, they just get worse. Ok, jamal has made this decision to let his little girl stay with, you know, her adoptive parents. And valerie is now fighting him and being all mother bear. ", "Rafe: You know what? You'll work it out. ", "Alison: Yeah, I know, but I sort of just need to blow off some steam. You know what I mean? ", "Rafe: I'm sorry. I got to run. ", "Alison: Well, wait -- who is it this time? Maybe I can help you, you know, like ian and eve. ", "Rafe: I don't need your help, alison, ok? You know, you have your own life, your own problems, and I got a job to do and not that much time to do it in. ", "Alison: Wait -- so then, in other words, butt out? ", "Rafe: Yeah. See you around. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: I figured a deal with the devil came with a price. So what is it, ramsey? ", "Chris: Well, it's about your continued role in karen's life. You see, i just gave her enough of the antidote to make her feel a whole lot better, but it's not enough to save her life. ", "Frank: You son of a -- ", "chris: Now, i will give her the rest if you take a permanent vacation from her life, starting now. ", "Frank: No way in hell! ", "Chris: Watch that temper of yours, frank. You wouldn't want a scuffle to break out and have one of those precious vials of the antidote destroyed, now, would you? Now pay attention because this is a one-time-only offer. You leave and she lives. You don't and she dies. Ball's in your court, buddy. So what's it going to be?
