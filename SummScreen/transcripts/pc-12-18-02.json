        "Kevin: I'm not talking about \r\nyour latest beating. I'm talking about our agreement, Jenny. You were supposed \r\nto leave town.\r\n\n",
        "Jenny: As soon as I get out of \r\nhere, I'm gone. No one's ever going to find out you paid me all that money to \r\ndrop the charges and leave town. It's our secret. ",
        "Kevin: I don't care how you do \r\nit. You find a way to vanish. ",
        "Jenny: You will never hear from \r\nme again. I'm really sorry someone called the cops. ",
        "Kevin: I'll handle them. I \r\ndon't want anyone connecting me to you ever again. ",
        "Jenny: Don't worry, Dr. \r\nCollins. You have my word. I won't cause you any more trouble. ",
        "Kevin (To Lucy): Hey. You ok? \r\nTell you what -- why don't we go home. This nightmare's over with.\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Rafe: Don't play games with me, \r\nLivvie. I know you too well. ",
        "Livvie: People can change, Rafe.\r\n",
        "Rafe: I don't know if you can. \r\nSee, I think you're trying to set up Stephen, who we both know is Caleb. \n",
        "Livvie: By dating Ricky? Boy, \r\nyou've got some imagination, Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: You're using the poor guy \r\nto get to Stephen. ",
        "Livvie: And what, exactly, \r\nwould I be setting Stephen up for? What, my big break as a backup singer? \n",
        "Rafe: You tried to kill Caleb \r\nonce. I think you're out to finish the job. ",
        "Livvie: And I think too much \r\nslaying and not enough playing has made you a really dull --\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: But first -- first you \r\nhave to make sure it is Caleb, so you're going to lure him out by making him \r\njealous. That's where Ricky comes in. ",
        "Livvie: I have absolutely no \r\nidea what you're talking about. My interest in Stephen Clay is zip, zero. \n",
        "Rafe: All right. You know what? \r\nStop. You don't have to defend yourself because the thing is I think your idea's \r\na good one. I just want in on it. ",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: Hmm -- ",
        "Stephen: Hey. You slept a long \r\ntime. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, I just had the \r\nmost awful dream. Oh. Tell me it was a dream, right? That what you said about me \r\nbeing a vampire wasn't true. I'm still the same person that I was, right? It was \r\njust a nightmare, wasn't it?\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Elizabeth, just calm \r\ndown. ",
        "Elizabeth: Look -- no, tell me \r\nthat that was a terrible mistake. ",
        "Stephen: You're just in a \r\nlittle bit of shock right now, all right, sweetheart all right? In time you'll \r\ncome to accept this -- ",
        "Elizabeth: Accept? ",
        "What? That I'm a -- a \r\nblood-sucking monster? ",
        "Stephen: Please, Elizabeth, now \r\nyou're just being insulting. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm changed now, \r\nStephen, forever. I can never go back to being who I was! ",
        "Stephen: Correct me if I'm \r\nwrong, but your life wasn't so great before. ",
        "Elizabeth: At least I was \r\nhuman.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: I never held it \r\nagainst you. ",
        "Elizabeth: I've got to get away \r\nfrom you. I've got to find somebody who will help me! ",
        "Stephen: Hey -- oh, now you're \r\ntalking crazy, all right? Relax, let me help you. ",
        "Elizabeth: Why did you do this?\r\n",
        "Why did you do this to me?\r\n",
        "Stephen: You want to know why? \r\nBecause I wanted you. I wanted you, and the alternative was for you to die.\r\n",

        "Kevin: You were pretty quiet on \r\nthe way home. Is everything all right? ",
        "Lucy: It was just a terrible \r\nnight and I'd really like to forget the whole thing happened.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah, you and me both. \r\nYou know, it's Ian's fault that this happened. ",
        "Lucy: Don't. That -- that is \r\nnot true. ",
        "Kevin: Really? Well, he sure \r\njumped to conclusions about me and he couldn't wait to send the police to our \r\ndoor. Guess he'll never accept that I've actually gotten better and that I'm \r\nback with my wife, not that Ian has ever respected anyone's marriages, though.\r\n",
        "Lucy: That's enough. \n",
        "Kevin: Oh, come on. We both \r\nknow why he did this. He'd pull any trick in the book to get me out of the way \r\nbecause he wants you for himself. ",
        "Lucy: Kevin, please don't.\r\n",
        "Kevin: You know, if I'm not \r\nthere, it's an open road to you -- that's what he's thinking -- and he'll have \r\nhis big chance. You know, I can't believe that just a couple of days ago I was \r\nthanking him for being such a good friend to you. The man's a hypocrite.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Stop it. I want you to \r\nstop it right now because Ian is not to blame. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, he's the reason we \r\nwent through this tonight. ",
        "Lucy: No, he isn't! You are. \r\nYou're the hypocrite. I know what you did. I -- I heard what you said to that \r\nwoman in the hospital. ",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: You would've killed \r\nme if I hadn't become like you? ",
        "Stephen: Of course not. What I \r\nmeant was if I hadn't given you the gift of immortality, you would eventually \r\ndie like all humans do. I couldn't bear that. ",
        "Elizabeth: You think that you \r\ndid this for my own good? ",
        "Stephen: You think it's easy \r\nliving forever while you watch the ones you love grow old and pass away? \r\nWatching their beauty fade? I couldn't watch that happen to you. I couldn't, my \r\n-- my beautiful Elizabeth.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: So in exchange, you \r\nturned me into a creature that lives off of blood. ",
        "Stephen: It doesn't have to be \r\nthat way. I've discovered the secret, the best of both worlds. ",
        "Elizabeth: What secret? \n",
        "Stephen: We can have \r\nimmortality and all the power and the passion that comes with it without ever \r\nhaving to feed or ever being detected. Everything we need to survive is right \r\nhere in this precious liquid. Listen, just take a drink and everything will feel \r\nbetter. ",
        "Elizabeth: No! You might as \r\nwell have just let me die. This is the end to everything that I have ever known, \r\nand right when I found my daughter. I wanted to be there for her wedding, \r\nStephen!\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Nothing has to be \r\ndifferent! ",
        "Elizabeth: I am different!\r\n",
        "Stephen: It -- it doesn't have \r\nto be. You've been watching too many old movies. Forget all the drama about \r\ncrucifixes and sunlight. You can live exactly the way you want to live, only \r\nbetter and longer, and you can share it with me. ",
        "Elizabeth: But everything that \r\nRafe told me about you is true. You're not Stephen. You are that -- that Caleb.\r\n",
        "Stephen: What's in a name?\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: But you hurt people! \r\nYou almost destroyed this town. Why would I even want to be with somebody who \r\nwould do something like that? ",
        "",
        "Livvie: You want to work with \r\nme and team up? Be all buddy-buddy? Dream on.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Look, I can help you get \r\nto Caleb, force him to reveal himself, and send him right back to his grave.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh. No, this is -- this \r\nis priceless. I mean, you've been treating me like dirt for several months now, \r\nbarely admitting I exist, and now suddenly you want to help me? ",
        "Rafe: Hey, you know what? You \r\nneed my help. Otherwise, that guy wouldn't still be breathing. ",
        "Livvie: I wouldn't help you or \r\nanyone else in this rotten town. I already did that. And where did that get me, \r\nRafe? Not exactly miss popularity. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, we don't have to make \r\nthis personal, Livvie. There's a killer o there who needs to be stopped.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Maybe if I really \r\nthought this rock 'n' roller was Caleb, I'd be interested in your little plan \r\nhere, but you are way off on this one. ",
        "Rafe: Come on, come on, come \r\non. You've been suspicious of Stephen from the beginning. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, maybe at first, \r\nbut I actually believe that we all have a twin out there. And I'm not going to \r\ngo kill some guy because he looks like some dead vampire or -- or so you could \r\nplay the hero of the town. ",
        "Rafe: Livvie, come here. You \r\nneed me to help. You're going to get killed if you do this on your own. \n",
        "Livvie: Oh. Yeah, that would \r\nreally break your heart, wouldn't it, Rafe? ",
        "Rafe: If you're not going to \r\nlet me help you, do me a favor -- just stay away from him.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: What possible \r\ndifference could it make what I do? Unless, of course, you're still a little \r\nhung up on me. ",
        "Rafe: Just take my advice, ok? \r\nYou're in way over your head. ",
        "Livvie: Why don't you drop this \r\nridiculous crusade of yours before you make a bigger fool of yourself. Leave \r\nStephen alone. ",
        "Rafe: Really? And why would I \r\ndo that, bright eyes? Unless -- ",
        "Livvie: Unless what? \n",
        "Rafe: Unless you're still hung \r\nup on Caleb. You don't want him dead, you want him back. You never got over him. \r\nYou never got the guy out of your blood. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I never hurt or \r\nhit that woman in any way.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: How am I supposed to \r\nbelieve that, when for days you've been looking me right in the face and lying \r\nto me. You acted so surprised that all of a sudden that woman dropped the \r\nassault charges. ",
        "Kevin: Because I was trying to \r\nprotect you. ",
        "Lucy: No. I -- I can't believe \r\nit. You -- you made me think that that whole thing was a sign from the universe \r\nthat everything was going to be ok, that we were on the right track, we were \r\ngetting everything back together, when all the time you had paid her off. You \r\npaid her to lie and you paid her to get out of town! ",
        "Kevin: I was just trying to \r\nmake everything right for us again. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. ",
        "Lucy: What are you sorry for? \r\nAre you sorry because you lied? Are you sorry because you got caught? \n",
        "Kevin: Both, actually. \n",
        "Lucy: Do you -- do you hear \r\nwhat you're saying? I don't believe it. I can't believe you. You stood there and \r\nyou said, \"this is it, Lucy, I'm going to face the music this time. I'm going to \r\npay the consequences.\" ",
        "Kevin: I didn't like the \r\nconsequences, ok? And what did I do that was so wrong? ",
        "Lucy: If you don't know that --\r\n",
        "Kevin: I paid a prostitute \r\nmoney to start a new life. Some people might even call that charitable, Lucy.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Oh --\r\n\n",
        "kevin: And as I recall, you've \r\nsolved more than one problem with a little cash. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Maybe I have. So \r\nmaybe the cash isn't really the problem here. It's the fact that you just lied \r\nand it doesn't seem to bother you at all ",
        "Kevin: Well -- Lucy, you never \r\nlied to me? Come on, Lucy. You've never told a little fib when you've done \r\nsomething wrong even for all the right reasons? So the worst I can be accused of \r\nis putting our marriage first, because I refuse to lie down and let our life \r\nfall apart around us. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Fine. You just go \r\nahead and rationalize it any way you want. You still did something very wrong.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: Or maybe I finally did \r\nsomething right. Maybe I finally wised up. ",
        "Lucy: What are you talking \r\nabout? You lied and you bribed somebody! ",
        "Kevin: So what? You want \r\nsomething bad enough, Lucy, you fight for it. Isn't that what you always say? I \r\njust took a page from your book, because I refuse to let anyone separate us \r\nagain. ",
        "",
        "Livvie: If Stephen is Caleb, \r\nwhy would I want him back, huh? Do you think I am suicidal? I was the one who \r\nkilled him before. ",
        "Rafe: I've given up trying to \r\nfigure out what turns you on, but I do know you want Caleb back. I can see it in \r\nyour eyes. ",
        "Livvie: God. Rafe, don't you \r\nhave some silverware patterns to pick out or something? Why don't you and your \r\nprecious little girlfriend leave me alone?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: All right, stop! I know \r\nyou've been hurt, but you cannot let this monster destroy your life. ",
        "Livvie: You're too late for \r\nthat. You and Alison already did that. And don't pretend that you give a damn \r\nabout me, because you never did. I tried to love you. I tried to make you happy, \r\nand I also -- I loved Jack with all my heart, and both of you turned on me, so \r\nwhat more damage could a vampire do? ",
        "Rafe: Are you kidding me? You \r\nplayed us both, me and Jack. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. And maybe it was \r\njust as well it ended up the way it did, because neither one of you were man \r\nenough to take what I was offering. Neither one of you were enough for me.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Oh -- what is enough for \r\nyou? ",
        "Livvie: I want someone who \r\nknows how to live, who makes me feel alive, not someone who gets caught up in \r\nduty and honor and all the other boring crap that you -- you hold on to like \r\nit's going out of style. ",
        "Rafe: You know what I think? I \r\nthink you want someone without a soul, someone who lives in the darkness, \r\nsomeone who exists in the shadows. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Sounds like my \r\nkind of guy. ",
        "Rafe: God help you. ",
        "Livvie: I'll help myself, thank \r\nyou. And I will get what I want. And there's not a blessed thing you can do to \r\nstop me. ",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: Don't try to deny \r\nit. You terrorized this town and everyone in it.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Caleb did those \r\nhorrible things. But I'm not him anymore. I'm Stephen. ",
        "Elizabeth: What's changed \r\nexcept your name? ",
        "Stephen: When I was Caleb, I \r\nlived in a world of loneliness and pain, and it was slowly poisoning me. I knew \r\nI couldn't go on like that. ",
        "Elizabeth: But vampires just \r\ncan't up and join the human race. ",
        "Stephen: With this they can.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: So this -- this \r\nwater or whatever it is, this allows you to live in the real world? ",
        "Stephen: All the benefits of \r\nbeing special without any of the side effects. Look at me. I used to be an \r\noutcast living in shadows, and now I'm -- hell, I'm Stephen Clay. I'm -- I'm \r\nborn again with a chance to live a full life with the woman I love -- with you.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: With me? You love \r\nme? ",
        "Stephen: That's why I bound \r\nmyself to you forever. Because I want you so much. ",
        "Elizabeth: Not just because you \r\nwanted to get closer to Alison and Rafe so that you could hurt them? ",
        "Stephen: Elizabeth, your words \r\nhurt me more than any slayer. Your cruel accusations -- ",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, listen. \r\nI have to know the truth if you want me to accept this. ",
        "Stephen: When we first met, you \r\ntold me no man ever loved you, no man ever made you feel so beautiful and alive. \r\nYou were this hidden jewel. Can't you see how much I love you? Don't you see it \r\nevery time I touch you?\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: It's really me that \r\nyou want? You don't want anyone else? ",
        "Livvie's voice: Call me what \r\nyou always have -- sweet Olivia. ",
        "Stephen: You're the only woman \r\nI want. Let me tell you about your eyes. Let me tell you about your hair. Let me \r\ntell you about your beautiful lips. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, I'm sorry I lied \r\nto you and I'm sorry that I hurt you, but I won't apologize for fighting for our \r\nlife. ",
        "Lucy: We could have fought this \r\ntogether. You know we could afford the best team of lawyers, all the lawyers in \r\nthe world if we wanted. ",
        "Kevin: And what if things \r\ndidn't go our way? What then? I would have been looking at five years in jail.\r\n\n",
        "Five years away from my family.\r\n",
        "Lucy: But we would have faced \r\nthat together as a family. ",
        "Kevin: That's not good enough \r\nanymore. I want to be there to teach Christina how to ride a bike, not read \r\nabout it from behind bars. And I want to be there for our first anniversary \r\ntogether. I want to be able to raise a toast to my bride. So I found a way to \r\nmake it happen. ",
        "Lucy: You bought your freedom.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Well, $25,000 is a small \r\nprice to pay for the privilege of continuing our future. Can you blame me for \r\nwanting my future back? ",
        "Lucy: I don't blame you for \r\nwanting that, no.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: I know what you're \r\nthinking. You're thinking, \"my Doc never would have done such a thing well, I am \r\nstill that same man, Lucy, only better, because now I have the strength to do \r\nwhat it takes to keep us together. Lucy, isn't there some way we can get past \r\nthis? ",
        "Lucy: What would you have done \r\nif you could not have bought off that woman? ",
        "Kevin: Upped the price. \n",

        "Ricky: Yo, Rafe. Special \r\ndelivery -- one water bottle. ",
        "Rafe: Thanks, man. Good job. So \r\nthis is Stephen's special designer water, huh? ",
        "Ricky: That's right. Doesn't go \r\nanywhere without it. He drinks it by the gallons. I snagged it from the \r\nrehearsal hall. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, about that. \r\nRemember what we said. We'll just keep this between us, right? ",
        "Ricky: Mm-hmm. That works for \r\nme. The guy's got a pretty fierce temper.\r\n\n",
