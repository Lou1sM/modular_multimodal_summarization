        "Lucy: You lovely little cards. I know it's been quite a while. It's been a \r\nvery long time, but, see, I think I really need you right now. I've been having \r\na little wacky time here lately, especially lately, lately. You know, I've been \r\nactually doing the unthinkable. I -- I've been doubting myself. Yes, me, \r\ndoubting myself. See, so I don't want to do that anymore. I want to make sure \r\nthat I did the absolute right thing, so I need your help. Now, listen, there's \r\nthis man, you know -- or person, a special person in my life that I'm very, very \r\nclose to, and -- well, you know all about him, don't you? He's my Doc, you know. \r\nAnyway, the point is, is he's going through an awful time right now, and to help \r\nhim out, I sort of told him this little white lie. Actually, it's a great, big, \r\nfat lie and, you know, I'm not sure I did the right thing. But it's just -- I \r\ndid it for the right reasons. You see, he is going through such bad times and \r\nhe's so miserable, I want to make it better for him. And I know you, the \r\nuniverse, everything, will begin to make everything clear to me as soon as \r\nyou're ready, but I'm not patient. You know that about me. I need to know right \r\nnow. So in the meantime, let's just do it. Let's just do it. Let's tell me if \r\nI'm on the right track. I need to know right now so, ok, cut to the chase. Here \r\nwe go. All right. I'm thinking, I'm ready, and -- oh my gosh, the Love card. The \r\nLove card? It is. It's the Love card. ",

        "Kevin: I should have treasured every second. What did I do instead?\r\n",
        "Eve's voice: Kevin, you're having a bad dream. ",
        "Kevin's voice: Damn you! The other day when you awoke me from my nightmare -- ",
        "Eve's voice: I was afraid for you. ",
        "Kevin's voice: You were afraid of me, Eve. Only you can make me forget Eve. ",
        "Lucy's voice: Eve. Oh, this is wrong. ",
        "Kevin's voice: No, Lucy, no. ",
        "Lucy's voice: This is so wrong, Doc. It's so wrong. It is. It is so wrong. ",
        "Kevin's voice: No. ",
        "Lucy's voice: It's wrong. ",
        "Livvie's voice: Stop it! Stay away from her! ",
        "Kevin: I hurt them all. Eve, Lucy, Livvie. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Livvie: Kevin? ",
        "Livvie: You there? Kevin, it's me. Kevin? ",
        "Kevin: Go away. Go away before I hurt you again. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian, I'll tell you a little secret. I'm finding out that I'm not so good \r\nwithout you. Please, Ian, come back to me. ",
        "Harris: Time's up, Eve. I've come to collect. ",
        "Eve: Get out. ",
        "Harris: We had an agreement, princess. I allow you to comfort Ian, and in \r\nreturn, you spend some quality time with me. ",
        "Eve: No agreement we've made goes into effect until Ian is better, and I mean \r\n100% recovered. Is that clear? ",
        "Harris: As long as we're on the same page. ",
        "Eve: We'll never be on the same page. But I will stick to my word. ",
        "Harris: A woman of her word. How refreshing. ",
        "Eve: There's just one catch. If Ian hears a word about any of this, all bets \r\nare off. ",
        "Harris: That's fine by me. I'll look forward to Ian's full recovery and -- \r\nahem -- seeing you later. ",
        "Eve: Ian. Ian, come on. You've got to come through this for me, ok? Please. \r\nPlease, I'm begging you. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: You know, you're right. I am the queen of hearts. I always have been, \r\nyou know. But lately my love life has sort of been on the hold button in the \r\ncosmic department there up in the universe. Sort of on hold -- you know, at \r\nleast for a while and everything. So, what is this about? Oh, no, no, no, I'm \r\nnot going there with you. Not Eve and Ian. No. Absolutely not. Not after what \r\nthey've done to Doc. I mean, faking their deaths like that and running off \r\ntogether. I don't think so. You know, they've sent Doc into this deep abyss, and \r\nno man as good as my Doc should be sent down to that level. No, this is too \r\nselfish and too cruel. It has nothing to do with affairs of the heart. It \r\nactually has more to do with affairs of certain body parts, so, no. Shame on you. Let's just move on. Ok. ",
        "[Lucy gasps] ",
        "Lucy: Ok, treachery. Um -- I can go with you a little bit on that. You know, \r\nit was a bit treacherous that I changed the DNA report to make Doc think that \r\nEve and Ian really are dead, but see, I had to. What was I going to do, let this \r\nbeautiful man think that his witch of a wife faked her death so she could run \r\noff with Ian? I don't think so. He needs to know that Eve is gone, gone for \r\ngood, gone away for really, really good. You know, so that's why I did it, so he \r\ncould get on with his life. And if -- if you think -- you know, splitting hairs, \r\nmaybe that's treachery. Listen, I did it for the right reason, ok? I need Doc to \r\nhave a life, to have a wonderful, peaceful existence and be happy for once. Ok. \r\nLet's just move on again. The queen of hearts. That's me! I'm the queen of \r\nhearts. Oh, my goodness, what are you saying here? Ok, first we have love, \r\ntreachery, and then love overcomes treachery? Is that what you're -- it's \r\nobvious, isn't it? I guess I should've known it all along. I love Kevin. I love \r\nKevin Collins, and I guess he's always been in my heart and my soul and I \r\nshould've seen this. I should've known this all along. What are you trying to \r\nsay here? Are you telling me that with everything that's happened that maybe \r\nwhat this all means is that Doc and I are going to get another chance? ",

        "Livvie: I just wanted to wish you a merry Christmas. And I brought you \r\nsomething. ",
        "Kevin: Well, you shouldn't have. I mean it. I don't deserve it. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I wanted to. ",
        "Kevin: I don't understand why you'd want to see me. ",
        "Livvie: Well, maybe because of the things you said. I mean, nobody's perfect.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Some of us are less perfect than others. ",
        "Livvie: When I was in the fourth grade, we were given this special assignment \r\nwe had to do for Father's Day. We had to make something, and I just made up the \r\nmost spectacular dad that a girl could ever have. I mean, he was kind and strong \r\nand smart and understanding. And he didn't judge me, and he never let me down. \r\nHe was you. ",
        "Kevin: You kept this all this time? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I mean, something deep down inside told me that I might need it \r\nsomeday. ",
        "Kevin: What does this say, the writing? ",
        "Livvie: It says \"world's greatest father.\" Look, the last thing you need \r\nright now is me getting in your face, so I just wanted you to know I was \r\nthinking about you, ok? ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, wait -- oh, brilliant. You did it again. ",

        "Eve: What kind of an idiot swallows poison to make a point? Why did you do \r\nthat? Why do you have to make my life so difficult? You know what? You are the \r\nmost maddening man I've ever met in my whole life! ",
        "Eve: Ian, listen to me. I know I get on your nerves sometimes, but you always \r\nseem to put up with it. You remember that night at Jake's, in the bar, when I \r\ngot a little tipsy and I was dancing up on the bar like a crazy woman? Remember \r\nthat? And when I fell, who caught me? You did. And you managed to make it seem \r\nlike it was all perfectly normal. ",
        "Eve: Who -- who caught me when I fell? Damn it. Ian, you've never let me say \r\nthe last word before. Why are you doing it now? ",
        "Ian: Will you stop yelling at me, woman? Please. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Livvie, let me look at that. Oh my God, you're bleeding. ",
        "Livvie: No, it's just a little scratch. ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry. I am so sorry. ",
        "Livvie: It's ok. ",
        "Kevin: Are you hit anywhere else? ",
        "Livvie: No. I'm fine. Please, just leave me alone. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, listen. Listen, I didn't mean to break that. If I could take \r\nthat back -- there's so much I want to take back. I just -- I don't know what \r\nI'm doing -- ",
        "Livvie: Look, I said forget it, please. ",
        "Kevin: No, Livvie, please listen to me. I was at the hospital today when the \r\nDNA results came in, and there it was in black and white. Eve is dead. ",
        "Livvie: I am very sorry. ",
        "Kevin: No, don't you be sorry! I'm the one! I'm the one who made it hard for \r\nher in the end. Now's the time when everyone tells you, \"Oh, remember the good \r\ntimes. It'll get you through the grief,\" but I can't remember any good times. \r\nAll I remember is the pain that I caused, and the fear. Because that's who I am, \r\nLivvie. That's what I do. And I can see the fear in your eyes. You're afraid of \r\nme now. That's why it was wrong for you to come here, Livvie. I'm not ready. I \r\ncan't give you what you need. ",
        "Livvie: I didn't even ask you for anything. I just wanted to help. ",

        "Eve: He needs his rest to let the poison work through his system. ",
        "Harris: You have quite a bedside manner, Doctor. Now it's payback time. ",
        "Eve: I've been awake for 48 hours. I really don't think I'd be very good \r\ncompany to you right now. ",
        "Harris: Why don't you let me be the judge of that? ",
        "Eve: Let me get some rest and take a bath, and I will hold up my end of the \r\nbargain. ",
        "Harris: Of course. I'm not a monster, Eve. I want you to be relaxed. I want \r\nyou to be at your most sensuous when you come to me. You're worth the wait.",

        "Kevin: I have learned the demons never really go away. They just go into \r\nhiding, Lucy, until you start to believe that you actually deserve happiness and \r\nlove. And then they just swoop right back into your life -- ugly, and twisted, \r\nand hurtful. And then you realize that you really are living the life that you \r\ndeserve. ",

        "Kevin: But I can handle that as long as I stop hurting everyone else. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok, fine. Why don't you go away. That's a good idea, actually. Go \r\nsomewhere warm and beautiful and relaxing, and you get your strength back. And \r\nthen when you come home, we will fight your demons together. ",
        "Kevin: You're not listening to me, Lucy. I'm going away. I'm leaving Port \r\nCharles, and I'm not coming back. ",
