        "Tess: Home, Jack? ",
        "Jack: Well, maybe not quite \r\nexactly, but at least it's where we met, huh? I never thought I'd say it, but it \r\nfeels pretty good to be back at this place.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: Why? Why come back here?\r\n",
        "Jack: So that me and you can \r\nfocus on us, pretend like there's nothing else out there. Just you and me.\r\n",
        "Tess: That's just pretend.\r\n",

        "Alison: [Disguised voice] Guess \r\nwho. ",
        "Rafe: Um -- I don't know. Could \r\nit be the sexiest, most beautiful girl in all the universe? ",
        "Alison: [Normal voice] Not \r\nquite. You forgot the luckiest. Hi. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Not yet. I have to \r\ngo to my mother's. I would love to, but I can't yet. But look at -- ta-da! I \r\nbrought you the chamber of commerce file on a small business. Jamal gave it to \r\nus from opening up the bike shop. So now you have a head start on the gym.\r\n",
        "Rafe: That's great. Tell him I \r\nsaid thanks.\r\n\n",

        "Elizabeth: Mmm. I remember \r\neverything this time, Stephen. I remember what it's like to bite you. My hunger, \r\nthe warmth, just your veins filling me. ",
        "Stephen: Everybody remembers \r\ntheir first time, and you always will. ",
        "Elizabeth: The whole idea of \r\ndrinking the human blood -- ",
        "Stephen: Shh. You'll never have \r\nto feed on anyone. You'll get the urges, but the water will help you control \r\nthat.\r\n\n",

        "Alison: I'm sorry, mother. I \r\nknow, you know, just kind of dropping by like this is not ok, but when I went to \r\nthe hotel to go see you, the guy at the front desk said that you had left with \r\nStephen and you looked like you weren't feeling very well at all.

        "Alison: Well, are you sure? \r\nBecause the guy seemed to think that -- ",
        "Elizabeth: No, I thought that I \r\nwas having a relapse of that flu, but Stephen brought in his specialist from \r\nManhattan and he gave me something and it's just miraculous. It made me feel so \r\nmuch better. ",
