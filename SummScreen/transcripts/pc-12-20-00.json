        "Livvie: So, Lucy won't be back till late. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. I -- so I guess she'll have to knock, huh? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I guess she'll have to knock. ",
        "Jack: Do you want to talk? You know, about what happened with your dad? ",
        "Livvie: No. I don't want to talk about anything. ",
        "Jack: You are so beautiful. ",
        "Jack: If you want me to stop, I will. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: You're leaving Port Charles? ",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: You're sorry? But what about Livvie? And what about -- what about the \r\nfact that you just found out she is your daughter? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, all I've ever done is hurt her. ",
        "Lucy: What, with what happened tonight? That's it? ",
        "Kevin: No, the fact is I should have left here long ago. Now, if you don't \r\nmind, I -- I have some business to take care of. ",
        "Lucy: Really? What kind of business? ",
        "Kevin: I have an associate who owns a clinic in Denver. He said I could have \r\na job any time I wanted it. It's still early in Denver -- Lucy, I'm sorry, but \r\nI'll let you know where I'll be. ",
        "Lucy: No, you won't because you are not going anywhere. I will not let you.\r\n",

        "Eve: I forgot my towel. ",
        "Ian: Here, let me. ",
        "Eve: Thank you. I thought you would still be asleep. ",
        "Ian: I'm feeling better. ",
        "Eve: Good. That's why I came out, because I -- ",
        "Ian: Hey, no big deal. ",
        "Eve: Right. No, no big deal. ",
        "Harris: Out of bed so soon, Thornhart? ",
        "Ian: Thanks for checking on me. ",
        "Harris: I wasn't. ",
        "Ian: Well, if you're here for the poison, it's too early. Still got to work \r\non the cure. ",
        "Harris: Then by all means, get to it. ",
        "Eve: Ian, you need your rest. ",
        "Ian: No, there's no time. Go get dressed. We got work to do. ",
        "Harris: You mean you have work to do. Eve's coming with me. ",
        "Ian: What the hell is going on? What do you need Eve for? ",
        "Harris: Not that I owe you an explanation, but Eve refused to let me in the \r\nroom the whole time you were suffering, wouldn't leave your side. I need her to \r\ntalk me through this, to prep me for taking the poison. ",
        "Ian: I'll talk you through it. I lived it. I know what the effects are. ",
        "Eve: Hey, Ian, listen, you were out of it completely. You're the last person \r\nto tell him what was going on. So why don't you just let me explain it to him, \r\nok? ",
        "Ian: Well, then do it here. You don't have to go anywhere. ",
        "Harris: What's the matter, Thornhart? You afraid I'm going to work my charms \r\non her? ",
        "Eve: Hey, will you let me do this on my own, please? Do you mind? ",
        "Harris: Absolutely. I'm rather curious to hear your explanation. ",
        "Ian: We ought to just let him die. ",
        "Eve: And die ourselves? We have to do whatever he tells us to, otherwise \r\nwe'll never get out of here. ",
        "Ian: Then what was he talking about, an explanation? ",
        "Eve: Look, come here. You said yourself that we don't have much time, right? \r\nSo let me deal with him, and you work on getting us out of here. ",
        "Ian: Eve, what's going on here? ",
        "Man: Time's up. ",
        "Ian: Don't touch her. ",
        "Eve: No, Ian, listen, I can take care of myself, ok? I'll be fine. I promise.\r\n",

        "Lucy: You will have to physically get by me if you plan on walking out that \r\ndoor because I'm not letting you leave town. ",
        "Kevin: What, you think you can keep me from going? ",
        "Lucy: How long have you known me? When I set my mind to something, do I ever \r\ngive in? ",
        "Kevin: Well, there's a first time for everything. ",
        "Lucy: No, there's not. Wait. No, Doc, put me down. I am serious! Put me down! \r\nPut me down right this instant. Put me down. Ok. Ok, fine. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, Lucy, let go of my arm. ",
        "Lucy: No. I am going to set the Guinness book of records for the person \r\nholding another person the absolute longest. ",
        "Kevin: Do I have to hurt you? ",
        "Lucy: You wouldn't dare. ",
        "Kevin: I already have. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc, please, please, you have to stop with this. You're hurting \r\neverybody in the world. That's not what this is about. This is about you \r\nhurting, and I am trying to help you. ",
        "Kevin: Don't you see what you're doing? ",
        "Lucy: I'm trying to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life. \r\nThere's no reason for you to leave Port Charles. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, there is. ",
        "Lucy: Fine. Name one. ",

        "Chris: Well, look, I'm sorry to come by so late, but can we talk? ",
        "Livvie: You know, it's just not a good time. Can we do this later? ",
        "Chris: Actually, no. It's about Jack. I'm really worried about him. ",
        "Livvie: What's wrong? ",
        "Jack: If you're so worried about me, why don't you tell me yourself? ",
        "Jack: Look, anything you got to say to me, why don't you say it to my face?\r\n",
        "Chris: Look, I was going to talk to you about this. It's just not easy to \r\nsay. ",
        "Livvie: Chris, what is it? ",
        "Chris: Seems Jack here has gotten himself into trouble with the law. ",
        "Livvie: Trouble? ",
        "Chris: Grand larceny. Now, see, he's supposed to see his probation officer \r\nonce a month, but you haven't been there since the summer. Now there's a warrant \r\nout for Jack's arrest. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: You're leaving because of me? ",
        "Kevin: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: Well, see, that makes absolutely no sense because I'm the person \r\nstanding here doing everything in her power to make you stay. ",
        "Kevin: And that's why. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm not leaving here, then. I'm staying in here until you explain \r\nto me exactly what this is about because it doesn't make sense. I don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you have this way of putting a good spin on everything that I \r\ndo. Even when I'm -- even when I'm at my worst, you find a way to make excuses \r\nfor me. ",
        "Lucy: But, Doc, you're going through a really rough time right now. You just \r\nlost your wife. ",
        "Kevin: Right there. You did it again. ",
        "Lucy: All I'm saying is that you need, you deserve a little TLC right now.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Truth is, all I would want is to be able to lose myself in you and \r\nhold you as tightly as I could and never let go. ",
        "Lucy: Then why don't you just do that? ",
        "Kevin: Because it's wrong. ",
        "Lucy: How can that be wrong? ",
        "Kevin: Because it isn't fair to either one of us. Most of all you. ",
        "Lucy: I get to decide that, you know. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you need to put your own life back together, not mine. ",
        "Lucy: I can do both at the same time. ",
        "Kevin: No, you can't. No, you can't. And I won't let you. Lucy, it's been a \r\nvicious cycle with us for years. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, maybe you're right, but friends helping friends -- how in the world \r\nis that a vicious cycle? ",
        "Kevin: When the one keeps dragging the other one down with him, that's when.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Doc, that is not what you're doing. ",
        "Kevin: Yes, it is! ",
        "Lucy: No, it's not! ",
        "Kevin: Yes, it is, and I won't let it happen again. I'm putting a stop to it, \r\nLucy. And the only way I can do that is to leave Port Charles. And there's \r\nnothing you can say to change that. ",

        "Eve: It's not my color. ",
        "Harris: Oh, not the dress. I mean for not telling Thornhart the real reason \r\nbehind our little visit. ",
        "Eve: If you had said anything, I wouldn't be here right now. ",
        "Harris: That was part of our deal. As you can see, I'm a man of my word. The \r\nquestion is, are you a woman of yours? You really do look beautiful in this \r\ndress. I think you would look even more beautiful out of it. ",
        "Eve: Let's just get this over with, all right? ",
        "Harris: Not quite yet. I have a question first. Woman like you can get any \r\nman she wants. Why do you want to waste your time with a man like Ian Thornhart?\r\n",

        "Harris: Just the way Thornhart likes it. Safe, no complications, no long \r\nterm. That's why he keeps on the move, you know. Not to help people but to get \r\naway from them once he finds out he has no use for them anymore. ",
        "Eve: You are wrong. You are dead wrong. Ian's a very caring person. In fact, \r\nsometimes I think he cares too much, which is why he gets himself into trouble \r\nall the time. ",

        "Harris: You can't have her yet. ",
        "Ian: The um -- the formula is in a live medium, so we only have a small window \r\nbefore it dies. And with it, so will you. So I need Eve to get this ready for \r\ntomorrow morning so you can live another day. ",
        "Harris: What's this? ",
        "Ian: Vitamin supplements. Help you boost your immune system. You can take \r\nthem--or not. That choice is yours. ",

        "Lucy: It's just a few days. I'm sure it would mean a great deal to Livvie. \r\nAnd it would mean a very great deal to me. We've all had so many losses this \r\nyear. Don't you think it would be kind of nice if we just helped each other get \r\nthrough the holidays? ",

        "Lucy: Ok -- um -- then I guess this means you'll at least be home for the \r\nholidays, huh? ",

        "Jack: Look, I can handle it myself. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah? How? ",

        "Eve: Just forget it, ok? Just forget about it. ",
