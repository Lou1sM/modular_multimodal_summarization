        "rafe's voice: \"It's finally here, the big night. After weeks of work, it all \r\ncomes down to one last chance. I'm telling you, as battered and beaten as all \r\nthese people may be, if they're not in each other's arms by the end of this \r\nnight, well, they never will be.\" ",
        "Rafe: Oh. I just -- I wish i could just shake them, you know, and let them \r\nknow how lucky they are to have love in their lives. I wish i could just -- this \r\nis crazy, but i wish I could just stand up at the top of the highest building \r\nand just shout out that there's nothing more important in heaven or earth than \r\njust be able to look deep into the eyes of the one you love and tell them, and \r\n-- so many people are given that chance, and -- and, wow, it's -- it's the ones \r\nthat don't pass up on that opportunity that are truly blessed, huh?

        "Lucy: Pardon me. Don't worry. I will settle down in just a minute. You know, \r\nflying and all. So, is this your first trip to hawaii? ",
        "Man: No. ",
        "Lucy: Really? Me, too. You know, my serena -- that's my daughter -- she \r\ndecided to spend a few days at christmas, you know, with her dad, wanted to \r\nspend christmas. That's ok with me because i decided to do something I've always \r\nwanted to do -- you know, go away, get away from all those people in port \r\ncharles that just suck the life out of me 52 weeks a year. Well, and anyway, I \r\nhad this great big christmas party thing planned with my fian-- my ex-fiance, \r\nand it's not going to happen. So you know what i say? Seize the day. Find your \r\nown happiness. That's what I'm going to do. You know what? Merry christmas to \r\nall those people in port charles. Merry christmas and a good night to them \r\nbecause they're going to have that party without me. It's my party. If i don't \r\nwant to show up to that party, i say i don't have to, right? I'm going to show \r\nthem. I will just show them all, don't you think? Ha! ",
        "lucy: I want you to be honest with me. I really want your opinion. I mean, \r\nyou are a man, right? ",
        "Man: Whatever you say. ",
        "Lucy: Right, so, I mean, now that we've established you're a man, you can \r\ntell me -- how is it possible that a guy, a man, can say, \"i love you madly, i'm \r\nin love with you,\" and in the next minute be making eyes at another woman? It \r\ndoesn't make any sense. You know, not that me and doc -- you know, us -- we've \r\nhad our problems and all. I did sleep with ian. I admit that, you know, and I \r\nthink we were working through that. There were reasons. But I'm a sucker. Do you \r\nsee what I'm saying? I am a big sucker, right? Be brutal. Just hit me in the \r\nface with it. Say it -- I am a sucker. Don't say it. No. I'm not. I'm just -- I \r\nwas just hoping, you know, that doc was going to do it, you know? We were \r\nfinally going to get married, but -- oh, I'm a chump! Say that -- \"you are a \r\nchump because you're not going to show up, though.\" I'm not doing it. ",
        "Man: Miss? Headphones, now. ",
        "Lucy: I'm not going to show up at that miserable party and let doc say he \r\nloves another woman and make a fool -- ",
        "flight attendant: And, miss, would you? ",
        "Lucy: No. Heck, no. I've seen that ridiculous movie. It's no good anyway. You \r\nknow, the wife does the murder. She kills him, so I think it stinks. Just like \r\nthe party's going to stink, right? Don't you feel that? It's going to be the \r\nbiggest dud that port charles has ever seen. I'll show those people. They're not \r\ngoing to have me to kick around anymore, you know? Ta and double-double ta. And \r\nif doc wants to hang out with that scarf-wearing slut, let him. I don't need \r\nhim, never have, never will. I'm going to have the merriest christmas I've ever \r\nhad, you know, in my whole life ever. Ever! ",
        "Kevin: Yes, yes! Just go through there -- talk to don, he'll sign for \r\neverything. Why do they have to deliver everything at the last minute? ",
        "Lucy? ",
        "Serena: Hi, kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, sweetheart! Oh, look at you! Oh, hey, wait a minute. Lucy told me \r\nthat you weren't going to -- ",
        "serena: That i wasn't going to be here. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. ",
        "Serena: Because I was going to be with dad. I still am for the rest of the \r\nholiday, but I talked him in to letting me come here. ",
        "Kevin: I'm glad because, you know what? Your mom's going to need you tonight.\r\n",
        "Serena: You mean to help? ",
        "Kevin: I mean, because she loves you like nobody else in the world. ",
        "Serena: You and me, you mean. You better get dressed and i'll go check on the \r\nG.P.S, ok? ",
        "Kevin: G.P.S. G.P.S? Oh, grandparents. Right, right. Ok, kids grow up. People \r\nchange. I guess everything does. ",
        "Woman: Did I hear \"change\"? As in, maybe you should, dr. Collins? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, so everyone keeps reminding me. She upstairs? ",
        "Woman: And waiting. ",
        "Kevin: Tell her i'll be right up, then. This isn't how i wanted do this, lucy.\r\n",
        "Rafe: You're not dressed. I mean, of course you are, but not for the party.\r\n",

        "Rafe: Well, you'll miss the grand finale. ",
        "Alison: I'm going to take off for chicago. But I -- i didn't want to go \r\nwithout telling you how much you've -- you've touched my life. You know, rafe, \r\nso many horrible things happen sometimes, and it's kind of hard to l past them. \r\nBut I think that if I ever forget what a wonderful place this world is, i'll -- \r\ni'll just think of you and i'll remember. ",
        "Rafe: Well, thanks. ",
        "Alison: You know, you're really special. You're -- you're special to me. ",
        "Rafe: You're the special one. More than you know. ",
        "Alison: Well, thanks for always making me feel that way. You know, it's just \r\nthat whenever i'm with you, I sort of -- ",
        "rafe: I -- ",
        "alison: Yeah. I'm sorry. I know you have to get to the party, so i kind of \r\ndon't want to keep you. I just sort of wanted to say that i -- ",

        "Valerie: I know we told them we'd wait, but i can't. I need to see hope. ",
        "Jamal: You do what you want to do. I already learned that. ",
        "Gabriela: So is there anything i can do? ",
        "Jamal: What, are you kidding me? You hopped on a plane and got tested, gabby.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: Well, what are sisters for? ",
        "Jamal: So you'd donate a kidney to some little girl you've never even laid \r\neyes on, huh? ",
        "Gabriela: That little girl is my niece, jamal. And you're the one person who \r\nnever gave up on me, even when i gave up on myself. What kind of a sister would \r\nI be if i said no? ",
        "Jamal: I won't forget this. ",
        "Valerie: Well, so much for that idea. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. What's up? How's hope? ",

        "Rafe: If i can pull it off. There's still a lot of things that could go \r\nwrong. ",
        "Alison: No. No, they won't. I have faith. I have faith in you. ",
        "Rafe: Well, thank you. ",
        "Alison: Wow. ",
        "Rafe well, what? Hey -- ",

        "Alison: I will try. ",
        "Rafe: Hey, if my being here made your life harder in any way, i don't know if \r\ni -- ",
        "alison: No, no. I -- I wouldn't trade a single second of the time that we \r\nspent together, not for anything. ",

        "Kevin: Lucy, without you, my world is so empty. My universe is empty. ",
        "Lucy: Pity, pity, pity. I -- i guess your punishment for being so cavalier \r\nwith my deep, deep feelings is having to live all alone without me. ",

        "Lucy: Ok. Start with my foot and work your way up. I love this. ",
