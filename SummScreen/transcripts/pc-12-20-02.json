        "Alison: Why not? It's just \r\nwater.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: I know perfectly \r\nwell what it is. I just don't want you near it. ",
        "Alison: Why not? What's -- \r\nwhat's wrong with it? And while we're at it, what is wrong with you? ",
        "",
        "Rafe: My instincts were right \r\nall along, weren't they, Caleb? ",
        "Stephen: So it would seem.\r\n",
        "Rafe: \"Seem\"? I saw your \r\nfreaking fangs, man. ",
        "Stephen: Ah, but we both know \r\nyou can't always trust what you see. The mind has a funny way of playing tricks. \r\nOne minute something's there, right in front of your eyes, and the next minute, \r\nit's gone. ",
        "",
        "Ricky: What do you say we move \r\nthis into the bedroom? ",
        "Livvie: Um -- can you just wait \r\na little bit longer, please? ",
        "Ricky: Wait for what?\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Something's wrong.\r\n",
        "Ricky: Whoa -- what do you \r\nmean, something's wrong? Nothing's wrong. ",
        "Livvie: The door is open.\r\n",
        "Ricky: No, the door's not open. \r\nI closed it myself. Wait, wait, wait -- where are you going? Come here. \n",
        "Livvie: Come on, let me go, \r\nplease? ",
        "Ricky: What are you -- \n",
        "Livvie: Ok, I know you were \r\nhere, Caleb. Where did you go? ",
        "",
        "Stephen: Ooh. Oh. Poor slayer. \r\nHe does try. ",
        "Rafe: But you're right, Caleb. \r\nThe mind does have a way of playing all kinds of strange tricks. ",

        "Kevin: All right, thanks.\r\n",
        "Jack: The door was open. \n",
        "Kevin: What do you want, Jack?\r\n",
        "Jack: Did you get my message?\r\n",
        "Kevin: You want to talk to me \r\nabout Tess? ",
        "Jack: Yeah. I just wanted to \r\nfind out why you haven't been by to see her since you been back. ",
        "Kevin: I've been busy. \n",
        "Jack: Too busy to come by and \r\nsee your own -- ",
        "Kevin: What? My what, Jack -- \r\nmy daughter? Is that what Tess is supposed to be? ",
        "Jack: It's possible. I mean, \r\nshe does look like Livvie. How do you explain that? ",
        "Kevin: Well, this is Port \r\nCharles, Jack. How do you explain a lot of things? There is no evidence that \r\nLivvie had a twin. There is no evidence that this woman you call Tess even \r\nexists. Why do you care, anyway?\r\n\n",
        "Jack: Tess needs a family. She \r\nneeds to feel like she belongs. ",
        "Kevin: So you want me to what \r\n-- invite her into the Collins family? ",
        "Jack: And that would be so bad?\r\n",
        "Kevin: Yeah, Jack. It would.\r\n",
        "",
        "Ricky: Hey, look. I don't know \r\nhow that door got open, but it's closed now, all right? We have all the privacy \r\nthat we need, so why don't you just come over -- what are you doing? Why are you \r\nputting that on? ",
        "Livvie: I think you better go, \r\nRicky. ",
        "Ricky: What? We were having fun \r\nhere. ",
        "Livvie: Right -- \"were,\" but, \r\nlook, things just didn't quite work out, so let's just call it a night, ok?\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: Wait a minute. Do you \r\nwant to tell me what just happened here? I mean, did I do something -- \n",
        "Livvie: Let's not get into a \r\nwhole thing here, ok, Ricky, please? ",
        "Ricky: Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry. I \r\nmean, pardon my curiosity, but a minute ago, you couldn't get enough, and now \r\nyou're practically throwing me out the door? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. Look, don't worry \r\nabout it. It's nothing, just a really, really big mistake. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, you're damn right, \r\na big mistake. You know what? You're seriously twisted. ",
        "Livvie: I haven't heard that \r\nbefore. Ricky, look, I don't mean to rush you or anything, but I am in a hurry.\r\n\n",
        "Ricky: You and me both. Don't \r\nworry, Livvie. I'm out of here. You know, there's a word for girls like you. I'm \r\nsure you've heard it before. ",
        "Livvie: Good-bye, Ricky. \n",
        "Ricky: What? ",
        "Livvie: Tess? ",
        "",
        "Stephen: I see you've still got \r\nsome of the old magic left. Kudos. ",
        "Rafe: How'd you do it? \n",
        "Stephen: Do what? ",
        "Rafe: You know what. How were \r\nyou able to come back? ",
        "Stephen: Does it really matter? \r\nYou're here, I'm here. I'm sure we both have our own reasons for returning.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Well, I know what your \r\nreasons are -- they never change. You're here to destroy. ",
        "Stephen: Who said anything \r\nabout destroying anything?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Are you going to stand \r\nthere and deny the Hell you put this town through? ",
        "Stephen: I'm not denying \r\nanything. All I'm saying is that was the past, that was Caleb. ",
        "Rafe: What do you mean? You are \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Stephen: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. We \r\nmay share the same good looks, but inside, I'm like you, and might I add, a vastly \r\nimproved version. Not Caleb --Stephen Clay. ",
        "Rafe: Ah, I see, well, you can \r\ncall yourself whatever you want, but you're no different than what you were!\r\n",
        "Stephen: If I'm no different, \r\nhow is it you can barely sense me this time around, slayer? Hmm? And you might \r\nhave noticed that I've been back a little while now and nothing's happened -- \r\nbodies aren't piling up, blood banks are safe.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Wait, wait, wait. So what \r\nare you telling me -- you're just a regular guy? ",
        "Stephen: As regular as a rock \r\nstar can be. ",
        "Rafe: I see. So you're a \r\nregular rock star with fangs and with the strange ability to protect yourself. \r\nSo how do you do that? How do you protect yourself from me, huh? I don't think \r\nit's a talisman this time. I wonder what it could be. Oh, you know, I did notice \r\nsomething -- the Caleb that I know didn't walk around guzzling water all day, \r\nbut you don't go anywhere without it, so that's it, isn't it? ",
        "Stephen: Believe what you want.\r\n",
        "Rafe: You know what I believe? \r\nI believe that that water allows you to not feed, so don't give me this \"I'm all \r\ngood now.\"\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: I never said I was all \r\ngood. ",
        "Rafe: No, you know what? You're \r\nnever going to change. The only difference is this time, you're not destroying \r\neverything straight out. You're just messing with our minds. ",
        "Stephen: You and your buddies \r\ntried to destroy me first. ",
        "Rafe: So, that's it -- you're \r\nback for revenge? ",
        "Stephen: Why is everything \r\nalways so dramatic with you? Ok. Yeah, I wanted to make a grand entrance, get in \r\nyour face a little bit and have a little bit of fun, but that's all there was to \r\nit. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, so you created this \r\nrock star persona just so you could get in my face? ",
        "Stephen: Don't flatter \r\nyourself, Rafe. I enjoy being Stephen Clay. Who wouldn't? Man, when you're a \r\nrock star, everybody loves you, everybody adores you -- even your little fianc\u00e9e \r\nAlison.\n",
        "Rafe: Right. And les s not \r\nforget about her mother, Elizabeth -- you know, the woman you bit? ",
        "Stephen: Ah, that. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, so what was that \r\nyou were saying about no feeding, no blood? You took your fangs and you sunk \r\nthem into her neck. You turned her. ",
        "Stephen: I gave her a gift, a \r\ngift I thought she'd love as much as -- ",
        "Rafe: You thought she would \r\nlove being a vampire? ",
        "Stephen: She's happy. We're \r\nhappy. We fulfill each other's needs. She's a perfect partner. ",
        "Rafe: A perfect partner that \r\nhappens to be the perfect way to get to me. ",
        "Stephen: Does everything have \r\nto be about you, man? All right. I admit, maybe in the beginning, it had a \r\nlittle something to do with it. But once I got to know her, I -- I don't know, I \r\nended up realizing how special she really is, and we just want to build this \r\nlittle life together.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: So what are you going to \r\ndo, settle down, live happily ever after in Port Charles as model citizens?\r\n",
        "Stephen: Yeah, something like \r\nthat. ",
        "Rafe: I don't think so. \n",
        "",
        "Jack: So what do you have \r\nagainst Tess? And what has she ever done to you? ",
        "Kevin: I'll draw you a picture, \r\nJack. Livvie comes to visit me in the hospital. She tells me about this young \r\nwoman who's come to town -- exact look-alike, miraculous powers to do all kinds \r\nof things. Everybody loves Tess. Including you, apparently. Meanwhile, those \r\nsame people treat my daughter like something they scraped off the bottom of \r\ntheir shoe.\r\n\n",
        "Jack: Oh. I see what this is \r\nabout. You're pissed off because I fell in love with Tess. ",
        "Kevin: Psychologically, Jack, I \r\nwon't even begin to go into the obvious implications of falling for the exact \r\nreplica of the woman you used to love. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, used to love before \r\nshe destroyed it, after she destroyed all the other relationships in her life, \r\nas well. ",
        "Kevin: Except with me. \n",
        "Jack: Well, maybe that says \r\nsomething about you, doesn't it? ",
        "Kevin: Good-bye, Jack. \n",
        "Jack: No, I'm not leaving here \r\nuntil you listen to me. Tess has nothing to do with Livvie. She's nothing like \r\nher. She's somehow connected to you whether you like it or not.\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Ricky: This is what you were \r\nwaiting for -- the doublemint twin here? I mean, this is part of your sick \r\nlittle game that you're playing he, Livvie? You know what? No, no -- I don't \r\nneed to hear it. I don't care. Oh, and by the way, in case you were wanting to \r\nstop by the rehearsal hall and hang out with the band, forget about it, all \r\nright? You, too, sis. ",
        "Livvie: Tess. God, what are you \r\ndoing here? Where's Jack? ",
        "Tess: Jack is -- he's home. \r\nHe's asleep. ",
        "Livvie: Well, you mean he \r\ndoesn't know that you're here? ",
        "Tess: I couldn't tell him. I \r\nwas afraid.\r\n\n",
        "Livvie: Afraid? What were you \r\nafraid of? Tess, what is it that you couldn't tell Jack? ",
        "Tess: I saw you, Livvie. \n",
        "Livvie: What? ",
        "Tess: You were in -- you were \r\nin the woods and you were dead. ",
        "",
        "Elizabeth: It's not a big deal, \r\nAlison. I don't see why you're getting so upset. ",
        "Alison: I'm getting upset \r\nbecause of the way that you are acting. You just took that bottle out of my hand \r\nlike it was some sort of poison. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, there's nothing \r\nwrong with the water. It's -- I just didn't want you to get my germs. I still \r\nmight have a little bit of that flu bug. ",
        "Alison: Let me see this. Let me \r\nsee it.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: What -- oh, you \r\nthink there's vodka in there? You think I'm some kind of a closet alcoholic?\r\n",
        "Alison: I don't know what to \r\nthink, I don't. ",
        "Elizabeth: It's just water. \r\nI've said, Alison. I just -- I don't want you to get sick. ",
        "Alison: That doesn't make any \r\nsense, mother. I just took a sip of your soda yesterday and you didn't seem to \r\nget upset at all. Why is this any different? ",
        "Elizabeth: Stephen just said \r\nthat it wouldn't be good for somebody who's not -- ",
        "Alison: Who's not what? \n",
        "Elizabeth: Who's not in his \r\ngroup. Please, Alison, just give that to me. Thank you. Thank you. That's just \r\nthe end of that. Um -- let's talk about something more interesting, ok? Let's \r\ntalk about the wedding.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Wait a second. Look, \r\nyou just said the other day -- you just talked about special water, this \r\ndesigner water. Mother, is that what this is? Is this, like, designer drugs? Has \r\nthe band got you hooked on something? ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, Alison, this -- \r\nthis is very, very different than drugs. ",
        "",
        "Stephen: What are you doing, \r\nman? We've been down this road before. It doesn't solve anything. We do battle, \r\none of us wins, usually me, but in the end, we both end up losing. Look at \r\nyourself, Rafe. I mean, sure, we can do this good-versus-evil thing till the end \r\nof time. But is that all you want out of life, man? Maybe I'm wrong, but I \r\nthought this time around, you wanted to be normal.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: That is what I want.\r\n",
        "Stephen: Ok. Well, right here, \r\nright now, we both have a chance for that. Do you really want to risk losing it \r\nover some ancient feud started by people we don't even know? Does any of this \r\neven matter anymore? Think about it because I do. I've been given this chance, a \r\nchance to live this incredible life -- money, power, love, eternal life -- \r\neverything I've ever wanted, and I didn't have to hurt anybody. And you -- your \r\nfuture's right in front of you, right there for the taking, everything you've \r\never wanted -- Alison, a wedding, a honeymoon, a little vine-covered cottage \r\nwith little blond kids running around out in front. Man, you've got the dream. \r\nSo what do you say we just drop all this once and for all because from where I'm \r\nstanding, we both have too much to lose. Come on, man. Give it a chance. Bury \r\nthe hatchet, or in this case, the stake. What do you say?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: There's only one problem, \r\nCaleb. See, you can't change who you really are. You might be a harmless rock \r\nstar now, but it's only a matter of time before the vampire inside comes out.",

        "Alison: Hey, hey, this is not \r\nfunny. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry, Alison. \r\nIt's just if you knew how funny this really was. ",
        "Alison: Ok, listen -- hey. I \r\nknow about the whole rock band thing, ok? I get it. I know that they experiment \r\nwith a lot of different things and that is sort of the mystique of it all. And \r\nit's very easy to get sucked in, and if you are on something, I'm not going to \r\nget upset with you. But if you are, just tell me and I will help you, I promise.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, you have no \r\nidea what you're dealing with here. ",
        "Alison: Ok, maybe I don't. But \r\nI think we both know how important it is to keep truth between us. And as long \r\nas we're honest with each other, we can get through anything. ",
        "Elizabeth: You really do care, \r\ndon't you? ",
        "Alison: Of course I care. You \r\nare my mother. ",
        "Elizabeth: And you really want \r\nto know what this is all about? Alison, it's the most amazing and beautiful \r\nthing. Oh, baby. We've gotten so close, haven't we? I would love if we could get \r\neven closer. You know what? I'm going to share this gift with you right now.\r\n\n",
        "",
        "Jack: What's the real problem \r\nhere, Kevin? I mean, are you afraid to face the truth -- that Tess is the best \r\npart about Livvie, and the daughter you love so much might be as big of a freak \r\nas you are? ",
        "Kevin: You don't have children, \r\nJack, so it's no wonder you'd underestimate unconditional love. I have no idea \r\nwhere this Tess came from. The fact is neither do you. I don't know what she is \r\nand neither do you, but I do know one thing -- she's out to steal Livvie's life \r\nand that does mean something to me if not to you or to anyone else. So why don't \r\nyou do us all a favor -- why don't you be Tess' family? I got my own.\r\n\n",
