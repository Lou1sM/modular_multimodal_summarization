        "Ian: Morning. ",
        "Eve: How's it going? ",
        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Eve: Hey, you know what? I know that you're upset about last night, what \r\nhappened with Harris, but -- ",
        "Ian: I'm not upset. Just -- the thought of you being with that man -- ",
        "Eve: It never got that far, ok? ",
        "Ian: Well, but it could've gone that far. I care what happens to you. ",
        "Eve: I care about -- I just -- want us to be ok. ",
        "Ian: We will be. ",
        "Eve: Really? You sound so sure. ",
        "Ian: I am. While you were sleeping last night, I figured something out. ",
        "Eve: You found a cure? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, if my calculations are correct, and I think they are. ",
        "Eve: Oh, great, let me see it. ",
        "Ian: No, I got to go show it to -- ",
        "Eve: Ok, I'll go with you. ",
        "Ian: No, why don't you start packing? ",
        "Eve: You know what, I don't trust Harris one minute. ",
        "Ian: Lambert -- ",
        "Eve: If I -- ",
        "Ian: Please. This time I make the deals. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Victor. ",
        "Victor: I didn't mean to startle you. I just came by -- ",
        "Kevin: I know why you came by. And you're not going to talk me out of leaving \r\nPort Charles. ",
        "Victor: Oh, I -- I didn't really think I could. But I do have a way for you \r\nto take the people who love you along. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Oh, Livvie, hi. I'm so glad you could make it. ",
        "Livvie: Somehow I don't think you asked me here for breakfast. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, no. But, listen, if you're hungry, I will buy you a Christmas \r\nbuffet. They have a great one here today. ",
        "Livvie: Look, if this is about Kevin leaving, I told you last night -- there \r\nis nothing I can do to stop him. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I know what you told me, but I think you just being there would \r\nmake a huge difference. ",
        "Livvie: Being where? ",
        "Lucy: Well, see, I had this idea. I thought, what if we had kind of an \r\nintervention, for lack of a better word, and got a group of us, of people \r\ntogether, you know, just to tell him how much -- ",
        "Livvie: But, Lucy, you heard Kevin. He was real clear about not wanting any \r\nhelp from me. From any of us. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie, please -- ",
        "Livvie: Look, I'm sorry, but whatever you're planning, you'll just have to \r\ndo it without me. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I know I said you can count on me. I know. And you can. Look, I -- \r\nlook, I've done everything you wanted. Look, would you just -- just give me a \r\nbreak, all right? Tonight I just want to be with my girl. ",
        "Alison: Look, like I said, I will do whatever it takes, just as long as you \r\npay me in cash. Yes, I know what you want me to wear. No, no, I -- I'm up for \r\nit. It's just -- I've never done anything like this before. Yeah, I'm sure it \r\nwill be fun for them. Nothing. I have to go. I'll see you there. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I hear you, man. Hey, hey, a job's a job, \r\nright? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, I'll be there. All right. ",
        "Alison: That your boss? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. Yeah, I tried switching things around, but it didn't work out. \r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "Alison: No! No, Jamal, that's fine. We have all day tomorrow to celebrate \r\nChristmas. Don't worry about it. It's ok. ",
        "Jamal: No, but I wanted to spend, you know, do something tonight. ",
        "Alison: Oh. Could you be any cuter? Could you? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I knew you'd be missing your family and everything. ",
        "Alison: Oh, please. My folks were never there. And it was, you know, me and \r\nNana. Woo-hoo! Big deal. Of course, you know, she'd always bail right after \r\ndinner and run right over to the Quartermaines'. I always knew that I was \r\ninvited, you know, but I felt really bad for our cook. She was the one who was \r\nreally alone, you know? ",
        "Jamal: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: So we'd stay and we'd hang out, watch \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" which \r\nwould always make us cry. ",
        "Jamal: You're so cute. ",
        "Alison: Oh. What about you? What did your family do? ",
        "Jamal: Oh. Man, when Mom was alive, she would just -- even when times were \r\nhard, she would just bake for days. I mean, she'd make the turkey and the \r\nstuffing and she'd have the pies and she'd bake the little cookies with -- in \r\nthe shape of the little -- what do you call them? -- the little reindeer -- ",
        "Alison: Oh. ",
        "Jamal: And the little Santas and stuff. ",
        "Alison: Well, did you help and stuff? ",
        "Jamal: You kidding me? I was the Picasso of cookie decorating, what.",
        "Alison: Oh! ",
        "Jamal: I'd put your one eye there and one eye there and -- you know, it was \r\nthe happiest times for my Mom. ",
        "Alison: You really miss her, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Hmm. ",
        "Jamal: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: I want to make this a happy time for you again. Ok? And I will, too, \r\nI promise. ",

        "Gabriela: Yes, it is. ",
        "Joe: Hmm. I loved waking up next to you. ",
        "Gabriela: Hmm. I loved falling asleep with you. In fact, I loved everything \r\nabout last night. ",
        "Joe: Hmm. Well, you weren't -- you weren't disappointed that we -- that we \r\ncouldn't -- ",
        "[Joe sighs] ",
        "Joe: You know, that we didn't make love? ",
        "Gabriela: Who says we didn't? ",
        "Joe: Yeah, good point. ",
        "Gabriela: I am disappointed about one thing, though. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, what? ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I have been awake for two minutes now and I still have not \r\nheard my three favorite words. ",
        "Joe: Your coffee, madam? ",
        "Gabriela: No. ",
        "Joe: Scrambled or fried? ",
        "Gabriela: Joe! ",
        "Joe: All right, all right. Uh, wait -- oh, wait, it couldn't be -- it \r\ncouldn't be I love you? ",
        "Joe: I love you. ",
        "Gabriela: I love you, too. ",
        "Gabriela: So, where's that coffee? We have a big day ahead of us. ",
        "Joe: I've got a big day, meeting your family for the first time, all 50 of \r\nthem. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, trust me, they'll love you. ",
        "Joe: Yeah, like Emilio? ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Joe: Oh, wait, that's probably him now with a shotgun. ",
        "Gabriela: Oh, stop it. I don't know who that could be. ",
        "Gabriela: Lucy, hi. ",
        "Lucy: Gabby, hi. Oh -- Joe. This is great. I caught you two together. ",
        "Gabriela: Come in, come in. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you very much. ",
        "Gabriela: Sure. ",
        "Lucy: I am obviously interrupting, as I'm wont to do and I know it's \r\nChristmas Eve and all, but, listen, I really need to ask you a favor. ",
        "Gabriela: Sure, what is it? ",
        "Lucy: Are you guys free a little later? ",
        "Joe: Later today? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You know, it's really, really, really, really important. Ok, so, \r\nthis looks like there's no way, huh? ",
        "Joe: Sorry, Lucy, we've already made other plans. ",
        "",
        "Victor: It's a photo album I put together. I figured you could haul it out \r\nevery once in a while if you get to missing your friends or family. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. And thanks for understanding why I'm leaving. ",
        "Victor: Well, I'm not going to pretend it makes me very happy, but I know all \r\ntoo well how it is when everywhere you look there's a reminder. ",
        "Kevin: I loved her, Victor. ",
        "Victor: And she loved you, very much. ",
        "Kevin: I know. But that's not the only reason I'm leaving. ",
        "Victor: I don't understand. ",
        "Kevin: Victor, the last few months, everything that's happened and -- \r\nespecially the way I handled it, I've just -- I've just come to see that there's \r\nthings about me that I hate -- the dark and destructive things. The things that \r\nhurt people before I'll let them get too close. ",
        "Victor: What are you talking about? You never intend to hurt anyone. You are \r\na kind, caring, loving person I am so proud to call my son. If you won't believe \r\nthat, you'd better believe this -- no matter who you are or think you are, \r\nleaving town is not going to solve anything. It'll follow you wherever you go.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I don't have any choice, Victor. I have to go before I ruin everything \r\nthat I've ever loved. ",

        "Harris: Thornhart, care to join me for a bloody Mary? ",
        "Ian: Little early for me. And you shouldn't be drinking, either. ",

        "Ian: If you want to beat this thing, you'd better start listening to me. ",
        "Harris: Oh. What good is surviving the poison going to do me? I'm sure it may \r\nkill the parasite, but, as you astutely pointed out, doctor, unless you find the \r\ncure -- ",
        "Ian: I have found it. That's why I'm here. ",
        "Harris: You have it? You found the cure? ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I've got the formula right here. And you want to know what I'm \r\ngoing to do with it? ",

        "",
        "Victor: Believe me, I know what it's like to think that your loved ones would \r\nbe better off without you, but think of -- think of the people whose lives \r\nyou've touched, the people who love you. ",
        "Kevin: Victor, I appreciate the pep talk. But this isn't self-pity. It's \r\nabout those people who don't deserve to be hurt. ",
        "Victor: What makes you so sure you're going to hurt anyone? ",
        "Kevin: My wife is dead! My daughter's an emotional wreck. And Lucy almost \r\ndied in a fire because of me! ",
        "Victor: Monk, that's much too simple. You can't blame yourself. ",
        "Kevin: I can blame myself and it is simple. None of those things would've \r\nhappened if I hadn't made them happen. So let's just drop it, ok? ",
        "Victor: Ok. I said I wouldn't argue and look at me. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. ",

        "Harris: I hope you enjoyed your little game, Thornhart. You do realize you \r\njust destroyed the one thing that's keeping you alive! In fact, I can't think of \r\none reason why I shouldn't have you shot in the head. ",
        "Ian: Ah, that's not a good idea. ",
        "Harris: Why not? ",
        "Ian: That's where your cure is -- right here. It's the only place it is. ",
        "Harris: Well, you think that's going to save you? I'll make Eve give me the \r\n-- ",
        "Ian: Eve doesn't know. ",

        "Harris: What is the purpose of this exercise? You will give me the cure. ",
        "Ian: Not until I get what I want. ",
        "Harris: You don't seem to understand, Thornhart! You and Eve will die if you \r\ndon't do what I say! ",
        "Ian: Your threats mean nothing to me. You're going to kill me no matter what, \r\nand as far as Eve's concerned, I know what you have in store for her and it's \r\nnot going to happen. ",
        "Harris: You have nothing to say as to what does or doesn't happen. ",
        "Ian: Here's the deal and it's nonnegotiable -- you let Eve go, and as soon as \r\nI get a call from her saying that she's safe and sound with her husband, I will \r\ngive you the right amount of poison to kill the parasite. And then and only \r\nthen will I give you the serum. ",
        "Harris: Then you'll have nothing left to bargain with for your freedom. ",
        "Ian: It's me you're after anyway, not her. ",
        "Harris: Ah. It's an interesting proposition. I'm surprised Eve went along \r\nwith it knowing the lengths she went to on your behalf. Oh, that's something \r\nelse you didn't tell her. ",
        "Ian: This is between us. ",
        "Harris: Never thought I'd see the day -- Ian Thornhart willing to lose to me \r\nfor a woman? ",
        "[Harris laughs] ",
        "Harris: Uh, uh -- you're in love with her, aren't you? ",
        "Ian: I'm not interested in your theories on my motives. Do we have a deal or \r\ndo we all die? ",
        "Harris: Only you would give your life for someone you can't have. ",
        "Ian: Don't change the flipping subject. ",
        "Harris: Life's cruel, isn't it? We all want as much of life as we possibly \r\ncan have, and it looks as though I'm going to have a hell of a lot more than \r\nyou! ",
        "Ian: Do we have a deal, Harris? ",
        "Harris: Yes, Doctor. We have a deal. ",
        "Ian: And the little arrangement between you and Eve? ",
        "Harris: Well, I don't see why we both can't enjoy her. I mean, for me, it'll \r\nbe a celebration of my renewed vitality. For you, a last hurrah. ",
        "Ian: You as much as look at her and I will let you die. ",
        "Harris: All right, yes. I'll send her straight home to her loving and \r\nadoring husband. ",
        "Ian: And she's to believe that we're both going free. ",
        "Harris: You can play this any way you like, Doctor, as long as we both know \r\nthe truth -- you lost, I won. ",
