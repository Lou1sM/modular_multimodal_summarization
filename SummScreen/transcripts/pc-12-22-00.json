        "Alison: Sir, please. Look, they promised me, ok? ",
        "Manager: Look, I heard you the first time. I don't know who told you that or \r\nwho you think told you that, but we don't have any elves in the makeup \r\ndepartment. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, I could be your, like, holly jolly, you know, like \r\nguerrilla spritzer. That'd be nice. ",
        "Manager: You're my holly jolly elf. Now go play over there. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry -- play? ",
        "Manager: If you don't know how, that guy right there will show you. Now get \r\nto work. ",
        "Alison: No, um -- well, ho-ho-ho to you, too. ",
        "Alison: Hello, Mr. Elf person. I'm your holly jolly -- Jamal! ",
        "Jamal: Alison, what are you -- ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy, what is going on here? ",
        "Lucy: I don't know, Doc. I'm actually as surprised as you are. ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Mac: Hey, you weren't going to start the party without me, were you? ",
        "Kevin: What party? What are you all doing here? ",
        "Victor: I think everybody's here for you, Monk. ",
        "Lucy: Well, except everybody here told me they already had plans. ",
        "Alan: Well, we changed them. ",
        "[Laughter] ",
        "Lee: Whatever plans we had were not as important as being here. ",
        "Kevin: Oh, boy. I don't believe this. ",
        "Gail: What Lucy said really sunk in, Kevin -- that you were leaving Port \r\nCharles. ",
        "Neil: Yeah, we had to try to talk you out of it. ",
        "Mary: It wouldn't be right around here without you. ",
        "Lee: That's right. ",
        "Serena: So you can't leave. ",
        "Lucy: No, because obviously, it would devastate a whole town. ",
        "Kevin: It's not that this doesn't mean a lot. It does, but my mind's made up.\r\n",
        "Lucy: Well, that's too darn bad because all of our minds are made up, too.\r\n",
        "Joe: If there's no way we're going to keep you from going, then we're just \r\ngoing to have to hold you here. ",
        "Kevin: No, look -- I love you for this. ",
        "[Kevin sighs] ",
        "Kevin: But I can't stay. And you're not changing my mind. ",
        "Mac: We all sacrificed our Christmas Eve to be here just with you, mate, \r\nbecause we love you so much. The least you could do is listen to us. ",
        "Lucy: He's right, so I'm going to go first. And it's about time I did this. \r\nMaybe it's just taken way too long for me to say this. But tonight, finally, at \r\nlast, I am going to tell you exactly how I feel about you, Dr. Kevin Collins.\r\n",
        "Kevin: I hope you all don't just expect me to stand here and -- ",
        "Mac: And take it? We sure do. ",
        "Alan: Now, just park it and suffer. You know as well as I do you do not fight \r\nwith Lucy when she has the Christmas spirit because you're not going to win. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you, Alan, and you're right. Ok, Doc. Here goes. I guess I'm a \r\nlittle nervous, you know, trying to -- that's not true. Actually, I'm a lot \r\nnervous because I think we all realize that if we don't change your mind here \r\ntoday, then it really is goodbye. You know -- ",
        "Kevin: No -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I want to do this because I know I wouldn't even be here today \r\nbeing able to tell you anything if it wasn't for you. Do you remember last month \r\nwhen I was in the hospital and you told me that you thought I had nine lives? ",
        "Kevin: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: I realized I do. And the reason I have nine lives is because of you, \r\ntoo, because you taught me how precious life is and how every single day there's \r\na miracle that happens to you and you just have to realize it. And the reason I \r\nrealize it is because you have always been there, at the right place at the \r\nright time saying just the right things to me. And I don't happen to be the only \r\nperson in this room that feels that way. ",
        "Frank: She's right. If it weren't for you, this guy and I wouldn't be as \r\nclose as we are today. ",
        "Neil: Yeah. I mean, I'm feeling kind of like you are now -- really mixed up \r\nabout stuff, trying to figure out why things happened the way they did. You made \r\nme see that I could get through it all, and that makes you pretty cool in my \r\nbook. ",
        "Mac: You know, I kind of hate to have to admit this to your face, but \r\neveryone here thinks you're pretty cool, Kevin. And luckily, we're on the clock \r\nso I can't run down the list of all the times that you have come through for me \r\nand called me on being a jerk when needed. ",
        "Kevin: Only when you deserve it. ",
        "Mac: So now you're getting what you deserve. Question is, what are you going \r\nto do about it? ",
        "Mary: Kevin, you're not going to make us all sing your praises and then walk \r\naway, are you? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, then, that settles it. You're staying. ",
        "Kevin: Look, look, I appreciate everything you're saying. And it feels really \r\ngood to at least know I might have made a difference in someone's life. ",
        "Lee: Kevin, you made a difference in the life of every person in this room.\r\n",
        "Scott: Now, wait a second. Maybe I should be the judge of that. ",
        "Lucy: Scott -- ",
        "Scott: Lucy, if everybody gets to weigh in on Kevin, it shouldn't just be in \r\na room full of friends. ",
        "Lucy: I know, but, you know -- ",
        "Scott: No, no, I'd like to give him my opinion. Would you like my opinion? Do \r\nyou think you can handle it? ",
        "",
        "Alison: Whoa. What are you doing here? ",
        "Jamal: What do you think I'm doing here dressed like this? ",
        "Alison: Wait, I'm sorry. This is your job? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear no jokes. I don't \r\nwant to hear it, Ali. ",
        "Alison: Wait -- jokes? Whoa! ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: I have been thinking all week that you are starting to get yourself \r\nin some kind of trouble, all right? And please, you cannot even imagine \r\nthe stuff that's been going through my head. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah. Yeah, please. Nobody can imagine the stuff that was going \r\nthrough your head -- nobody. ",
        "Alison: Right. Ok. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Well, I could never imagine you -- I mean -- ",
        "Jamal: What? Why don't you just say it? Say it, Ali. Go ahead, say it. ",
        "Alison: I'm sorry -- tights? ",
        "Jamal: See? That's exactly why I didn't tell you. I'm out! ",
        "Alison: No, no! Please! ",
        "Jamal: No. ",
        "Alison: You can't quit. ",
        "Jamal: Well, then, watch me. ",
        "Alison: No, you can't! I can't take my eyes off of you. ",
        "Jamal: Why? Because I look like a clown, huh? Is that what it is? ",
        "Alison: No, no. You look adorable. ",
        "Jamal: Don't touch me. You think adorable makes me feel any better? ",
        "Alison: If we're both working, then at least we can be together on Christmas \r\nEve. You know? How romantic is that? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, like this, huh? Not. ",
        "Alison: Ok, well, at 12 bucks an hour, it sounds pretty good, you know? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, and I need the cash, too, so -- ",
        "Alison: You trying to buy something special, huh? ",
        "Jamal: Well, maybe. ",
        "Alison: Well, how about you and I go spread some of our first Christmas \r\ntogether holiday cheer around, all right? ",
        "Jamal: All right. Well, make sure you save a little bit for me. ",
        "Alison: Oh, don't you worry. ",
        "Jamal: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: Because I've got plenty of that at home for you. Ok? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Eve, wait. ",
        "Eve: What? I thought you wanted -- ",
        "Ian: This isn't real. This comes from us being cooped up in here. We're \r\ntrying to hold on to something that we can trust. But this isn't it. This -- \r\nthis is -- oh -- ",
        "Eve: What? Hard to describe? ",
        "Ian: No. What's hard is knowing that you're going home to a husband who loves \r\nyou and who misses you very much. ",
        "Eve: Do you really think that we're going to go home if we cure Harris? ",
        "Ian: With all my heart. And I also believe if you look back on this, you'll \r\nbe glad that you have nothing to apologize for. Hey, you know I'm right, \r\nLambert. ",
        "Eve: Would it do any good to argue with you? ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "Henchman: Merry Christmas from the boss. ",
        "Ian: All right. ",
        "Eve: Oh, that's heartwarming. ",
        "Ian: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. We can use a little Christmas \r\ncheer. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Yeah, we could. ",
        "Ian: So let's start -- start drinking so we can count our blessings. ",
        "Eve: Yeah. ",
        "Ian: So what do you think? ",
        "Eve: I think that it doesn't really look much like Christmas in here, does \r\nit? ",
        "Ian: It does. We've got candles. We've got champagne. We've got steak, \r\napparently. ",
        "",
        "Scott: Listen, Kevin, we haven't always seen eye to eye on things and, well, \r\nmaybe that's because we're a lot more alike than we know it. ",
        "Lucy: Uh, yeah. You're both really loyal. ",
        "Scott: And stubborn. Listen, I don't like to tell people what to do or not do \r\nwith their lives. I'm just saying that if you don't know how important you are \r\nand how much you've mattered around here, then you're working at not knowing \r\nthat. ",
        "Kevin: Listen, Scott, please -- ",
        "Scott: No, Kevin, listen to me for a second, all right? You get paid to do \r\nthis. Just give me, like, a two-minute session. All right, now, you helped me \r\nget rid of Bordisso when Christina was grabbed. You helped us there, and when \r\nSerena lost her eyesight, there you were and all I did was pretty much yell at \r\nyou. I never really thanked you, so you do what you want, but just don't go away \r\nthinking that you don't matter. ",
        "Alan: You know something, Kevin? Every time I see Robin, it makes me remember \r\nwhat you did for Stone -- how you made the end of his life so much better and \r\nhow you helped Robin lead such a full life despite the fact that she was \r\nHIV-positive. ",
        "Kevin: But Robin's strength is her own, Alan. You know that. ",
        "Gail: Kevin, you were the one who helped her find her way, as you have with \r\nso many people through the years. And not just the faces in this room, but -- \r\nbut all the people that you help every day in your practice. ",
        "Serena: So you can't go. We need you. ",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Serena: We all need you. ",
        "Mac: That's right. ",
        "Gail: She's right, Kevin. We do. We really do. ",
        "Kevin: Uh, look -- uh -- I don't -- I don't know what to say. Excuse me. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Nothing like a festive holiday dinner, is there? ",
        "Eve: Oh, sure. The only thing is we could use a little atmosphere. ",
        "Ian: You're right. There's no tinsel. There's no inkety-blinky lights. ",
        "Eve: Inkety-blinkety what? ",
        "Ian: No strings of popcorn, no mistletoe, no stockings in the fireplace. ",
        "Eve: What fireplace? There's no fireplace. ",
        "Ian: There will be. Here. Put our name on these and then hang them from the \r\nmantle, and don't tell me there isn't one. Draw one if you have to. ",
        "Eve: Why don't I just draw the stockings, too? ",
        "Ian: Because you can't put sugar plums in two-dimensional stockings. Use your \r\nhead, woman. ",
        "Eve: And while I am doing this -- ",
        "Ian: I'll be trimming the tree. ",
        "Eve: Oh, there's a tree! ",
        "Ian: And why don't you sing some carols while you're at it? Wouldn't hurt.\r\n",
        "Eve: Oh, it would if I started singing. ",
        "Ian: No, I can take it if you can. Look at that. All right. ",
        "Eve: There. How's that? ",
        "Ian: Oh, it's perfect. The Christmas spirit is rising in you. ",
        "Eve: And I'm just getting started. By the time I finish decorating this \r\nplace, the only thing that will be missing will be presents. ",
        "Ian: Well, if it's presents you want, it's presents you'll get. ",
        "Eve: Thornhart, where are we going to get presents? ",
        "Ian: Lambert, you should know by now I always have something up my sleeve.\r\n",
        "",
        "Alison: Ok, so, what's going on? ",
        "Jamal: You are not going to believe this. ",
        "[Jamal sighs] ",
        "Jamal: We are locked in here. ",
        "Alison: No. No. No, no, no. No, I had all these plans for us for Christmas.\r\n",
        "Jamal: Well -- me, too. You know, I wanted to give you the kind of Christmas \r\nthat you're used to. ",
        "Alison: And I was going to give you the kind of Christmas that you always \r\nsaid that you had when you were a kid. ",
        "Jamal: I really hate not giving you all the things you're used to. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no. No, no. Jamal, no. Look, I don't -- I don't need any presents \r\nto make this evening special, ok? Because I've got the best one sitting right in \r\nfront of me. Hmm? ",
        "Jamal: You know what I'm thinking? ",
        "Alison: What, that there is some mistletoe up in that ornament up there? ",
        "Jamal: No, it's not. ",
        "Alison: But there could be with a little imagination. ",
        "Jamal: I'm starting to imagine that this could be the best Christmas I've \r\never had. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe you could imagine a little bit closer. ",
        "Jamal: I could do that. ",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Hey, Doc. ",
        "Kevin: Sorry. I just had to get out of there. I was about to lose it. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I know. I could see that. You know, that happens sometimes when \r\nyou have people telling you how much you matter to them. It just gets you down, \r\ndoesn't it? ",
        "Kevin: You're not going to make this easy, are you? ",
        "Lucy: No, absolutely not. I'm going to fight you every step of the way. I'm \r\ngoing to call out a roadblock if I have to, call the sheriff. I'm going to do \r\nanything I can to keep you here -- ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: I am, Doc. ",
        "Mary: Come on. ",

        "Lucy: Well -- I don't know. ",
        "Mary: We're not giving up. ",
        "Kevin: Listen, everyone, everyone -- thank you. Thank you for coming here \r\ntonight. Thank you for taking time out of your lives and your Christmas. And I \r\nknow what you want me to say, but -- ",
        "Livvie: Stop. Please. Look, before you go on, there's something I need to \r\nsay. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie. ",
        "Livvie: Look, all my life, I wanted to know who my father was. And now you're \r\nhere. And if there is still a chance that we can be close one day, I would like \r\nto have that chance. And so I am asking you to stay, too, just like everybody \r\nelse. ",
        "Kevin: But you're not just anybody else. ",
        "Livvie: Look, we just found each other. And -- just please don't leave, not \r\nnow. Please. Please, Dad. ",
        "Kevin: Livvie, come here. ",
