        "\nJack: \r\nOk, ok. Well, if you see Tess, call me, all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm starting to \r\nworry. Thanks, Jamal. Jeez. Tess. Oh, my God. What's going on? I woke up and you \r\nweren't here. What -- hey, what's the matter? You're crying. What is it, Tess? \r\nAre you -- oh, no. Are you having those strange flashes again? Well, what -- the \r\nheadaches? Is it the headaches? Are you having those -- Tess, you have to talk \r\nto me. Tell me what's going on. I want to know. I can't figure it out unless you \r\ntell me.\r\n\n",

        "Elizabeth: Alison, there's just \r\nsomething that I want to share with you, ok? Something wonderful. ",
        "Alison: Mother, I don't like how \r\nyou're acting and I really don't like how you look, ok? Your cheeks are flushed, \r\nyou're, like, shaking, and you've been talking a million miles a minute. Either \r\nyou have a touch of the flu back or you are on something. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I am high on life, \r\nthat's all. I have never felt better. ",
        "Alison: Are you sure that this water \r\nthat you're drinking, this designer water maybe isn't some sort of, like, \r\nfeel-good juice maybe? ",
        "Elizabeth: Are you implying that I'm \r\non drugs?\u00a0\r\n",
        "Alison: I'm not implying anything. I'm \r\nflat-out asking. Are you? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, it's nothing like \r\nthat. It's -- it's about Stephen. It's about love. It's about feeling alive \r\nafter years of sleepwalking. ",
        "Alison: Ok, you're freaking me out. \r\nAll right? I'm going to call the doctor. I don't know what's going on with you, \r\nbut you're not acting like yourself. ",
        "Stephen: Go ahead. Take what you need. \r\nYou don't have to fight it anymore. ",
        "Alison: Yes, yes, l'll hold, but \r\nplease hurry. ",
        "Elizabeth: I have a special gift for \r\nyou, Alison, something from a mother to a daughter, something old, something \r\nnew. Call it an early wedding gift.",

        "\nRafe: I never could've trusted you, \r\nCaleb. ",
        "Stephen: Well, what do you know? I'm \r\neven immune to the stake now. Ah. So what do you think we ought to do with this, \r\nslayer? I mean, it didn't work on me, but you're just a man now, aren't you, \r\njust flesh and blood? ",
        "Rafe: No. No, you -- you can't be.\r\n",
        "Stephen: You should've seen your face \r\nwhen I did that little waking-from-the-dead thing. It was priceless. ",
        "Rafe: It is the water, isn't it?\r\n",
        "Stephen: It helps. Here I was, \r\noffering you an olive branch and not only did you not accept it, but you took it \r\nand tried to shove it through my heart. And they say I'm the bad guy.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: All right, you want to take me \r\ndown? Come on. Take your best shot. ",

        "Tess: I know the truth now about the \r\npictures I see in my mind. They are things that happened to Livvie, I know, \r\nbecause they happened to me, too. ",
        "Jack: No, see, you just think that \r\nbecause you feel other people's pain. ",
        "Tess: That's why I went to see her. \r\nAnd we started talking. And suddenly, it all came back to me. ",
        "Jack: What -- what did? What -- what \r\nare you talking about? ",
        "Tess: I'm a part of Livvie. \r\n",
        "Jack: No. No, Tess, you might look \r\nlike Livvie, but you're not Livvie. It does not mean you're Livvie.\r\n\n",
        "Tess: No, I am her. ",
        "Jack: No, stop it. You're -- you are \r\nTess. You are a wonderful person. Livvie's not. ",
        "Tess: No, no. I'm not a person. Jack, \r\nI'm no one. I'm no one. ",

        "Stephen: Not that I don't have every \r\nright to kill you. That's not what I'm about anymore. ",
        "Rafe: So what are you about, Caleb? \r\nWhat are you into these days? ",
        "Stephen: Fame, fortune, rock 'n' roll.\r\n",
        "Rafe: In Port Charles? Of all the \r\nplaces on the planet, you choose to come to Port Charles. ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, it was a start. \r\nActually, I think the Stephen Clay Experience is going to be hitting the road \r\nreal soon.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: You expect me to believe that? \r\nYou expect me to believe you're just going to slink out of town without leaving \r\nyour usual trail of bodies dead and undead? ",
        "Stephen: I'm not slinking. I never \r\nslink. You, my friend, have serious trust issues. ",
        "Rafe: And you have already started \r\ndestroying lives! ",
        "Stephen: I've been a perfect citizen!\r\n",
        "Rafe: You turned Alison's mother. And \r\nas long as Elizabeth is still sharpening her fangs, Alison will never be safe.\r\n",
        "Stephen: Is that what's bothering you? \r\nFine. Consider it eliminated. Elizabeth will never bother you and Alison again.\r\n",
        "",
        "Alison: Hi. Dr. Hamilton, please. Yes, \r\nyes, I'll hold.\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: I have wasted so much time \r\nwithout you. And now, we can be together forever. Forever. That's the gift I'm \r\ngiving you. ",
        "Alison: Mother, I love you. And I just \r\nwant to make sure that you're not sick, ok? Mothers and daughters, they're \r\nsupposed to look out for each other, right? ",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. It's going to be \r\nok, ok? ",
        "Elizabeth's voice: Alison, I know I \r\ndon't derve it. Please, just give me a chance, ok? I'll do anything. Please, \r\njust let me be your mother. I can't believe what I was about to do. ",
        "Alison: That's just fine. Just have \r\nhim call as soon as he gets the message. Thank you. Ok. The doctor wasn't there, \r\nbut they are going to call us back as soon as they get the message. In the \r\nmeantime, why don't you get some things and come over to my house --\r\n\n",
        "Elizabeth: No, actually, you know, \r\nsuddenly I'm feeling much better. I think I'm just nervous about the wedding, \r\nyou know -- mother-of-the-bride jitters and everything. I'll be fine after I \r\ntake a bath. ",
        "Alison: Well, maybe you have some sort \r\nof a fever. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, don'y. Stay away \r\nfrom me. I just still might have some of that flu. I just -- I don't want to \r\ntake any chances. ",

        "Mr. Travis: I got a sweet lead on your \r\nmissing relative. This was hidden behind a wall in your father's office. I'm \r\nbetting it holds some answers to your questions about his private life. \r\n",
        "Alison: I'm sure that it probably \r\ndoes. Oh, I'll go ahead and look through it on my own if you don't mind and then \r\nI'll get back to you. ",

That's what I \r\nsee. And how can you be nothing when you mean everything to me? See, because I \r\ncan feel your warmth. I can feel your hair as it touches my cheek. I can touch \r\nyour cheeks. I can touch your lips. That's real. And then I can kiss them, too, \r\nover and over again. That's real, Tess. That's so real. And I can't live my life \r\nwithout you. That's real, too.\r\n\n",
        "Jack: You -- you are more real to me \r\nthan anyone I've ever known. And -- ",

        "Tess: I love you, Jack. ",
        "Alison: Open it. Open it, open it. \r\nDon't be a chicken now, Alison. This could maybe lead me to my brother or \r\nsister. ",
        "Alison: Okey-doke, what do we have \r\nhere? A calendar. Tax laws. I'm sure my picture's not in here. Letters. \r\n",
        "Alison: Letters. ",
        "Alison: \"My darling Malcolm\" -- these \r\nare love letters. These aren't in my mother's handwriting. \"When we first met, \r\nyou were so cold and unhappy, but today after we made love and I held you close, \r\nyou -- you were so free. I don't think I've ever heard you laugh until today. I \r\nlove the sound of your laughter. It will keep me warm when you're away. Love, \r\nKatrina.\" Katrina --\r\n\n",

I know you can't be a real father to our child, but I pray one day we \r\ncan all be together.\" Oh, my God. This is her. This is the mother to my brother \r\nor sister. I found her. ",
        "Elizabeth: I was about to -- God, I \r\ncan't even say it. I can't even think it. I was about to bite my own daughter. \r\nOh, dear God. What have I become?",
        "",
        "Rafe: It's not enough that you turned \r\nElizabeth into a vampire. Now you want to kill her? ",
        "Stephen: Man, you got killing on the \r\nbrain. I said I'd take care of Elizabeth. I'll take care of her by taking her \r\nwith me.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Oh, I see. So you're going to \r\ntake her, what, on tour with you and your little rock 'n' roll vampires? \r\n",
        "Stephen: Wouldn't you like to know?\r\n",
        "Rafe: You're having one hell of a \r\ntime, aren't you, Caleb? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah. Yeah, it's ok. Grinding \r\nyour teeth in frustration? ",
        "Rafe: Which is exactly why you chose \r\nElizabeth. Rattle my cage, right? ",
        "Stephen: It might have had something \r\nto do with it in the beginning, but, once again, don't flatter yourself too \r\nmuch. ",
        "Rafe: You destroyed that woman's life, \r\nbloodsucker. ",
        "Stephen: \"Bloodsucker\" is so 20th \r\ncentury. And may I remind you, you don't even like Elizabeth.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Alison does. That's all that \r\nmatters, and you robbed her of family. ",
        "Stephen: Alison can still have a \r\nrelionship with her mother from afar. It's not like she's not used to it. I'll \r\nbring Elizabeth home at the holidays, pack plenty of water so we don't have any \r\nembarrassing situations. I mean, we wouldn't want Nana disappearing between \r\ncourses -- ",
        "Rafe: If you come anywhere near Alison \r\nor her family, you will regret it. ",
        "Stephen: Actually, I'm quite fond of \r\nAlison. There's something about those Barrington women, don't you think? What's \r\nwith the long face, Rafe? Huh? Is it because you might actually miss me when I'm \r\ngone? Or is it the realization that you can't destroy me?\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: If you exist, you can be \r\ndestroyed. ",
        "Stephen: Oh, I exist -- just as you \r\ndo. You know, we're not so different, you and me. We were both sent back for a \r\nsecond chance. ",
        "Rafe: What do you mean, sent back?\r\n",
        "Stephen: Oh -- didn't I tell you? \r\nYeah, I was banished from this earth, that's true. But one person set me free.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah? And just who did you \r\nget to do your dirty work this time? ",

        "Tess: That's all I want. ",
        "Jack: You know, Tess, what just \r\nhappened between us happened because we love each other. And that's as real as \r\nit gets. Any time that you feel lost, just hold on to me, and I'll show you who \r\nyou are. ",

        "",
        "Alison: Ok, there's got to be \r\nsomething else in here, something that tells me a little bit more about this \r\nmystery woman, this mistress my father kept a secret. Who is she? Where is she? \r\nWhere are you? ",
        "Alison: \"I love you, Katrina.\" Oh, my \r\nGod. Well, one thing I know for sure is that she's very beautiful.\r\n\n",

        "Rafe: You came back because of me? I \r\ndon't think so. ",
        "Stephen: Of course you wouldn't. \r\nBecause your view of the world is so narrow. Everything has to be so good. But \r\nthen what do you got? You got a world out of balance. ",
        "Rafe: What -- what are you talking \r\nabout? What does this have to do with me? ",
        "Stephen: When someone's sent back to \r\nearth from upstairs, like you were, downstairs gets to do likewise. Even-Steven, \r\nso to speak. So when you traded in your halo for the woman you love, let's just \r\nsay I got a \"get out of hell free\" card.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: No. No. It can't be. ",
        "Stephen: It's all about balance. What \r\nhappens when you drop a pebble in a lake? It creates a ripple that fans out and \r\ntouches everything. Now that you know the truth, I can finally thank you for \r\ndropping that pebble. Here's to you and second chance. Ah. Merry Christmas, \r\nslayer. ",
