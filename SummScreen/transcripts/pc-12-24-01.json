        "Kevin: You're right, Lucy. There is another woman. And, no, it's not what you \r\nthink. Trust me. Do you have enough faith in me to do that, despite what you \r\nthink you know? To marry me -- now? Do you trust me enough to believe that I love you and \r\nI always will? I'm asking, yes or no -- will you marry me? ",
        "Lucy: I saw you go into that room with that woman. Room 1215. She was a very, \r\nvery pretty woman. You know, I saw you with her. ",
        "Kevin: I'm asking you to trust me in spite of what you think you saw. ",
        "Lucy: You're asking me an awful lot, you know that, Doc? An awful lot. ",
        "Kevin: Well, if I believed that, I wouldn't be standing here. And I wouldn't \r\nbe asking you. And I wouldn't be feeling that all the magic that's happened here \r\ntonight wasn't somehow meant to end in you and me finally seizing the day. Don't \r\nthink, Lucy. Feel it. What does the universe tell you? What are your heart and \r\nyour soul telling you? ",
        "Lucy: We sure didn't plan this. I mean, neither one of us thought it would be \r\nlike this, right? ",
        "Kevin: No. It just happened. ",
        "Lucy: Just like some big accident or something, right? ",
        "Kevin: Right. Except there are no accidents. ",
        "Lucy: No, only what is meant to be. ",
        "Kevin: And that's what this is, Lucy. This is the one-in-a-million shot that \r\nyou wish and you hope and you pray for, and if you blink, it disappears. Let's \r\nnot blink this time. ",
        "Lucy: So what you're asking is you're asking me to trust you completely and \r\nabsolutely. Trust. Well, I do trust you. I don't know what happened in that \r\nroom, 1215, and I don't know what you were doing with that woman, but I do know \r\nyou. You're my Doc. And I know you love me. And, oh, Doc, I love you so much. \r\nAnd I also know we weren't really ready before, not until now. ",
        "Kevin: And your answer is? ",
        "Lucy: Sure. Yeah. I mean, why not? You know, I will. I do. I think I'm going \r\nto -- let's get married right now, right here! ",
        "[Cheers] ",
        "Alison: Do you think that Lucy has any idea that this is going to be more \r\nthan just a wedding? ",
        "Rafe: Not a clue, but she's about to find out. ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa. What am I doing standing around \r\nhere? I got to go -- I got to go, you know, make myself pretty or something -- \r\nhey. ",
        "Livvie: What's wrong? ",
        "Lucy: Would you get Serena? Maybe you could help her get ready? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah! Yeah, yeah! I'll go find her right now. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. All right. Thanks. ",
        "Kevin: Thanks, honey. ",
        "Victor: You're going to need something old. Maybe I could walk you down the \r\naisle. ",
        "All: Oh! ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Victor, I'd be so honored. ",
        "Kevin: Now, that's my dad. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! ",
        "Mary: But you still need something new, something borrowed, and something \r\nblue. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, you're right! Forget all that! I don't have anybody to perform the \r\nceremony. We don't have anybody. ",
        "Kevin: Not so fast. Rev. Giovanni, raise your hand. There he is! ",
        "Victor: That's incredible. ",
        "Kevin: Yeah, for an unplanned wedding, we seem to have pretty much everything \r\nwe need. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, I love you. ",
        "Kevin: I love you. ",
        "Lucy: I love you. ",
        "Don: No, no, save it for the wedding. ",
        "Kevin: Hey, mind your own business. ",
        "Don: You got to get going. ",
        "Kevin: No, all right -- no. ",
        "Lucy: Ta. Ta. Ta. ",
        "Don: That way. I'll meet you there. ",
        "Mac: Yeah, it's true, I get to be your best man. ",
        "[Mac laughs] ",
        "Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Mac: Oh. I'm so happy for you, Kevin. ",
        "Kevin: Thanks for hanging in there with me. ",
        "Mac: Congratulations. ",
        "Kevin: Thank you. ",
        "Eve: Kevin? ",
        "Eve and Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Eve: So you're going through with it, huh? ",
        "Kevin: Looks that way. ",
        "Eve: Well, I wish you all the best. ",
        "Kevin: I wish the same thing for you. ",
        "Eve: Friends forever, right? ",
        "Kevin: Friends forever. ",

        "Livvie: Good thing you wore a white dress. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I sort of didn't start out that way. It just -- the white dress \r\nshowed up. ",
        "Serena: How lucky was that? ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, what's this box? ",
        "Lucy: What's what box? ",
        "Livvie: This big white box. ",

        "Livvie: Lucy, it's a train. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Oh, my goodness. ",
        "Livvie: And I think it -- yes, it totally goes on the back of your dress. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, it's gorgeous. It's so gorgeous. ",
        "Serena: Look at this! ",
        "Livvie: It's a veil. ",
        "Serena: It's a veil. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Look at this. These are both exquisite. I can't believe it. Where would \r\nthey come from? ",
        "Serena: The universe. ",
        "Lucy: The universe. Oh, who cares? You know what this means? If I had any \r\ndoubts before, I certainly don't now. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that takes care of something new. ",
        "Serena: You still need something borrowed and something blue. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, dear, I do. You know, I'm going to need all the good-luck charms I \r\ncan get. What am I going to do? ",
        "Livvie: Serena? ",
        "Serena: Yeah? ",
        "Livvie: Come with me. I think I -- I do. I have an idea. ",

        "Ian: I think you're -- you're an incredible woman. ",
        "Lucy: You do? ",
        "Ian: And you trust in the one you love, and that makes Kevin a very lucky \r\nguy. ",
        "Lucy: Thanks. You know, Kevin and I, we found our way back to each other, so \r\nI know you and Eve can do the same thing. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I hope so. ",

        "Rev. Giovanni: Please be seated. Dearly beloved, we're gathered together here \r\nin the presence of God and of this company that Lucy and Kevin may be united in \r\nholy matrimony. We're here to celebrate and to share in the glorious act that \r\nGod is about to perform, the act by which he converts their love for one another \r\ninto the holy and sacred estate of marriage. I'd like the couple to begin by \r\nexchanging their personal vows. Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Excuse me, Reverend. You see, this really wasn't planned, so we \r\ndon't really have any preplanned vows -- ",

        "Kevin: Huh. ",
        "Lucy: I guess there's something to be said for that old adage -- try, try, \r\ntry, try and keep on trying again. Ok. Here it goes. I have waited to be \r\nstanding up here next to you like this for what seems like forever. I've dreamed \r\nabout this day, and I know you have, too. And now that it's finally here, and \r\nwe're really going to do this, I look at your face and everything that has come \r\nbetween us before, everything, it just seems like it's completely disappeared. \r\nAnd all that's left is the one truth that we've always had between us forever -- \r\nour love for each other. Oh, doc, that -- that love, I guess, when you think \r\nabout it, is all that really matters, isn't it? And our love is so real and so \r\nstrong, I know that it can get us through anything. So standing here right now \r\nlooking at you, I want to say thank you. Thank you for reminding me of that. And \r\nthank you for making me believe in our love again. I love you. ",

        "Lucy: Ok, thank you. I just want to say that I know when we look at each \r\nother, it seems like we've known each other forever and ever, but today -- \r\ntonight -- we start down a whole new road because our future is limitless \r\ntogether, just like the universe. And I just can't wait to see where that road takes \r\nus together, forever. ",

And I cannot tell you how glad I am for that because you \r\nalso taught me that opening my heart and listening to my soul is the key to \r\nbeing alive. And life with you is the grandest adventure of all. And I'm glad \r\nbecause for the first time, I can actually look forward to growing old because I know in my heart that you'll even make that fun. \r\nI love you, Lucy. I love you. \r\nAnd I'm going to spend the rest of my days making you happier than you ever \r\ndreamed possible. Starting with tonight. Are you ready for that? ",
