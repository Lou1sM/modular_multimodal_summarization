        "Stephen's voice: When someone's sent \r\nback to earth from upstairs like you were, downstairs gets to do likewise, \r\neven-steven, so to speak. So when you traded in your halo for the woman you \r\nlove, let's just say I got a \"get out of hell free\" card.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: I thought me coming back here \r\nwas some sort of reward, you know, for me and Alison, for our love for each \r\nother, for our faith in each other. I didn't know evil got a free ride back with \r\nme. I mean, what kind of cosmic balance is that? ",
        "Rafe: How am I going to give you the \r\nlife of your dreams and still get rid of our biggest nightmare? ",
        "Alison: Hi. There you are. So, what do \r\nyou think? ",
        "Rafe: I think it's perfect. I think \r\nyou're perfect. ",
        "Alison: I wanted tonight to be really \r\nspecial for us. ",
        "Rafe: And I just want to say thank you \r\nfor making every night very special. ",
        "Alison: Merry Christmas Eve.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Merry Christmas Eve to you, too.\r\n",
        "Alison: And merry almost wedding day.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Even better. ",
        "Alison: So, here's to the rest of our \r\nvery happy, glorious, normal lives together.",

        "Ian (to Eve's grave): Merry Christmas, \r\nEve. There's no place we'd rather be than right here with you. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Hi. I was just going to put \r\nsome more gifts under the tree. Guess you did some more last-minute shopping, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, there were just a few \r\nthings I wanted to pick up for the girls. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: I'm going to take a shower now.\r\n",
        "Kevin: Can we just talk for a minute?\r\n",
        "Lucy: No, I -- no, I don't. I still \r\ncan't picture it. I just can't picture you standing there and acting so \r\nsurprised when that woman agreed to drop all the assault charges and agreed to \r\nleave town.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: I thought you of all people \r\nwould understand. ",
        "Lucy: Understand what? That it's ok to \r\npay off somebody and then lie so easily to me about it? ",
        "Kevin: No. Because I didn't want our \r\nlife to be blown apart again. Lucy, it's not like I hurt anyone. ",
        "Lucy: You did. That woman got hurt.\r\n",
        "Kevin: No. ",
        "Lucy: She almost died! ",
        "Kevin: But not because of me. How \r\ncould I know what would happen? ",
        "Lucy: I -- ",
        "Kevin: You know what, Lucy? What I'm \r\nmost sorry about is that your trust in me has been broken. But can't we find a \r\nway to get past that, just for tonight? It's Christmas Eve.\r\n\n",
        "Lucy: Somehow I'm having a really hard \r\ntime getting into the Christmas spirit. ",
        "",
        "Tess: Thank you. It's beautiful. And \r\n-- and thank you for last night. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. It was pretty amazing, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Tess: For me, too. ",
        "Jack: Hmm. Now do you know how real \r\nyou are to me? You're your own person, Tess, separate from Livvie. ",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Jack: Ah. Well, I think our guests are \r\nhere. I'll be back. ",
        "Livvie: Merry Christmas, everyone.\r\n",
        "Jack: What do you think you're doing?\r\n",
        "Livvie: I'm moving in with my sister.\r\n\n",

        "Livvie: Hi, Tess. Take that. \r\n",
        "Jack: Livvie, there's no way in hell \r\nyou're moving in here. ",
        "Livvie: Tess and I have a bond, Jack. \r\nWe need to watch out for each other like family. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, you're not family.\r\n",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Jack: Don't get comfortable. \r\n",
        "Livvie: Tess, you have to convince \r\nJack to let me stay because now that we know Caleb created you from me, we know \r\nthat we are a part of each other. ",
        "Tess: But I want to be my own person.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, I want that, too. But \r\nright now we know if something happens to one of us, it happens to the both of \r\nus, so we need to, you know, keep each other safe.\r\n\n",
        "Jamal: What's Livvie doing here?\r\n",
        "Jack: She wants to be Tess' keeper, \r\nbut I'm not going to let that happen. ",
        "Livvie: I have a Christmas present for \r\nyou in the car. I'll be right back, ok? ",
        "Jack: Hey, are you ok? ",
        "Tess: I want her to move in, Jack, \r\nplease? ",
        "Jack: Oh, Tess. I thought we talked \r\nabout this. ",
        "Tess: Look, I know you don't like her, \r\nbut I want a chance to get close to her, too. ",
        "Jack: You don't need Livvie. You're \r\nyour own person. ",
        "Tess: No, we need each other. Jack, \r\nplease, didn't you tell me that Christmas is the time to forgive and when people \r\nshould be together? ",
        "",
        "Alison: One year I convinced Nana to \r\nlet me open up every single gift on Christmas Eve. Hey.\r\n\n",
        "Rafe: Hmm. ",
        "Alison: Rafe. ",
        "Rafe: Hi. ",
        "Alison: What's wrong?? ",
        "Rafe: Nothing. ",
        "Alison: Don't be like that. Tell me. I \r\ncan see it in your face. ",
        "Rafe: No, it's nothing. ",
        "Alison: What's going on? ",
        "Rafe: It's nothing. ",
        "Alison: Talk to me. ",
        "Rafe: Look, I think tonight is \r\namazing. Everything about tonight is amazing, and I consider myself the luckiest \r\nperson in the world, just to be sitting with you here right now. And even \r\nluckier that I'm going to get to marry you. But I'm just a little worried, you \r\nknow, that I won't be able to protect you and I won't be able to give you the \r\nlife you deserve and --\r\n\n",
        "Alison: You already have. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but -- here's the thing -- \r\nthis world is not always good. ",
        "Alison: Well, I know that, but I think \r\nthat sometimes you just have to have faith, you know? Especially on a night like \r\ntonight. Trust me, and I think this is going to be a very special Christmas Eve \r\n-- a night to always remember. Hmm? ",
        "[Alison giggles] ",
        "",
        "Lucy: I can't just suddenly pretend \r\neverything's ok with us. ",
        "Kevin: Well, it'll take some time.\r\n",
        "Lucy: It's not -- it's not time. Time \r\nisn't the thing here. It's you. It's the way you talked to that woman, the \r\nthings you said, and the things you said to me -- that everybody has a price and \r\neverybody can be bought. The way you said that, it scared me.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: I just wanted you to understand \r\nhow much you mean to me and that I don't want us to be separated again. \r\n",
        "Lucy: Don't you see what -- it's like \r\nyou've separated us even further. ",
        "Serena: Look, there's even more \r\npresents underneath the Christmas tree. ",
        "Christina: Yippee! ",
        "Serena: Hooray! ",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute. It's not quite \r\nChristmas time. Put those down. Come on! ",
        "Serena: But we can't sleep. Can we \r\nstay up later tonight, please? ",
        "Lucy: No. No, no, no. ",
        "Christina: Read me a Christmas story.\r\n",
        "[Serena laughs] ",
        "Kevin: Uh -- ok. What would you like \r\nto hear? ",
        "Christina: The story of you and mommy.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: Ok. Which one? ",
        "Christina: The Christmas one, when you \r\nbecame my mommy and daddy. ",
        "Serena: That's right. It was a year \r\nago tonight. We got back Christina and you guys got married. ",
        "Kevin: You know, you're right, it was.\r\n",
        "Christina: Tell about how you loved us \r\nso much that you made us a family. ",
        "Kevin: This was the most beautiful \r\nChristmas party I had ever seen. It was like a perfect winter wonderland. You \r\nknow what? Your mommy - she kept avoiding me. She kept running through the crowd \r\nlike a running back at a football game. ",
        "Serena: Hmm. But you finally caught \r\nher.\r\n\n",
        "Kevin: And I asked her to take a huge \r\nleap of faith with me. Do you trust me enough to believe that I love you and I \r\nalways will? It's up to you. I'm asking, yes or no? Will you marry me? \r\n",
        "Serena: And she said yes. ",
        "Kevin: And then the best part of the \r\nwhole night -- right before we said \"I do\" -- ",
        "Christina: That's when I came! \r\n",
        "Lucy: Christina? ",
        "Kevin: Merry Christmas. That was the \r\nmost beautiful sight I'd ever seen. I thought I would just burst when I was \r\nwatching her. And right then and there, I knew there was only one thing in my \r\nlife that I wanted -- I wanted to make my family happy.\r\n\n",
        "Serena: And how did you feel, mom?\r\n",
        "Lucy: I felt so lucky. I was thinking \r\nthat this was everything I ever wanted in my life. I had the man that I love to \r\nmarry, and I had you, and I got my Christina back, and I was surrounded by my \r\ndaughters and my husband and all our family and friends. ",
        "Christina: Why not tonight, mommy? \r\nWhere's Ian and Danny? ",
        "",
        "Ian: There you go. What do you think? \r\nIt's pretty good, right? Oh, I know. It's not as nice as the one down in the \r\npark. You should see that thing, Eve. It's gorgeous. ",
        "[Danny coos] ",
        "Ian: Big as a house. It's going to \r\nlight up the whole sky. I know it will. Some of the patients in the hospital say \r\nthat they look out the window and they see it, it makes them feel like the \r\nholidays, even if they're not with their families. I know what they mean. I just \r\nwish, you know, I -- I wish I could give the boy more of a family, not just this \r\ngrumpy old dad, you know? He's good friends with Christina, and I think Serena \r\nlikes watching him, but I kind of screwed that one up, too. I screwed up a lot \r\nof things since you've been gone. But I'll give him a good Christmas.\r\n\n",

        "Jack: I talked to Tess. She wants you \r\nto stay. ",
        "Livvie: Well, I'm not surprised. I \r\nknow you don't like it, Jack, but we are connected. ",
        "Jack: Save it, Livvie. I don't trust \r\nyou. ",

        "Tess: I'm really glad you're here.\r\n",
        "Chris: Well, me, too, me, too. You \r\nknow, I've been thinking a lot about you, the way you heal people on the inside \r\nand out. You know, you're a real miracle worker. ",
        "Tess: I just wish there wasn't so many \r\nhurt people.\r\n\n",
        "Chris: Yeah, I know. Me, too. Listen, \r\nyou know, is there anything I can do for you? You know, I don't want you to \r\nworry about anyone else right now, you know? How about the headaches? Have they \r\ngone away? ",
        "Tess: Better. ",
        "Chris: Good. Well, it's Christmas. How \r\nabout a wish? Anything you want, anything. Just let me know. ",
        "Tess: Well, all I want is everyone to \r\nbe together and to love each other tonight. ",
        "Marissa: You know, my mom still can't \r\nstop talking about you. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, whatever. You know, joke \r\nall you want, ok, but it really is -- it's big to me that you stuck around for \r\nthe holidays, because I know how you like big family Christmases and everything.\r\n\n",
        "Marissa: Yeah, I do, but I'll be there \r\nnext year, and maybe you'll be there with me. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I think I'd like that.\r\n",

        "Tess: Ok. ",
        "Livvie: I have one just like it, and I \r\ndidn't know what to get you, and I figured if I liked it, then you would \r\nprobably like it. ",
        "Tess: It's beautiful. Thank you.\r\n",
        "Jamal: So, now she's got them dressing \r\nalike? Isn't that kind of freaky? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, everything about Livvie is \r\nfreaky. But Tess wants her in her life, wants to be close to her. ",

        "Rafe: Yeah. Wow, that seems like a \r\nlong time ago. ",
        "Alison: Doesn't it? That's just my \r\npoint. See, everybody has their problems, but I think that it's love that gets \r\nyou through that, and it's what's gotten us through this past year. ",
        "Rafe: Oh, wow. You're right. \r\n",
        "Alison: I am? I am? ",
        "Rafe: You are so right. You make me so \r\nhappy. I just, you know -- I'm done playing this little mind trip on myself. \r\nLet's talk about something else. Let's -- my favorite subject -- let's talk \r\nabout you.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Ok. Are you ready for some \r\ngood news? ",
        "Rafe: Absolutely, anytime. ",

        "Rafe: And? What was in it? What was --\r\n",
        "Alison: There were some documents and \r\nsome letters and a photograph of the woman that we've been looking for -- the \r\nwoman who is the mother of my brother or sister. ",

        "Rafe: What? ",

        "Rafe: Thanks. Wow, I -- ",

        "Rafe: Wow. That's great. So it's just \r\na regular watch with no countdown, no stopping?\r\n\n",
        "Alison: No. And it will tell time \r\nforever, because it's solar powered. And it will never die, just like our love.\r\n",
        "Rafe: Well, this is -- it's beautiful. \r\nI love it. I -- man, I love you. ",
        "Alison: It's to remind you that we are \r\ntogether now and our time is endless. And it's also to remind you to stop \r\nworrying, because we're together now and everything is going to be just fine, \r\nok? What was that? ",
