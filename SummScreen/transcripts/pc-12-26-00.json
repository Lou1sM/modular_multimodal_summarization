        "Lucy: Ok, so -- here I am again, asking for another major clue. All right, \r\nlisten, I know things are working pretty well so far. I mean, I got Doc to stay \r\nin town. I sort of persuaded him to do that, so my stars are pretty lucky. So \r\nfar so good. So let's move on to the next step. Ready? \"Deception.\" Ok, ok, it \r\nwas a little deception. You see, I had to lie, though. I had to change the \r\nresults of that DNA test to show that Eve and Ian did die in that big car \r\nexplosion or else Kevin would've been ruined. You know, I had to protect him \r\nfrom the truth -- the truth that his trampy, disgusting, so-called wife ran off \r\nwith Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome. See, that's -- that's why, so let's just move \r\non from that, ok? Let's just see what the next step should be. Yes! Yes. \r\n\"Destiny.\" That's it. Everything in perfect harmony and perfect balance. Yes, \r\nthat is a great big cosmic thumbs up from the universe if I ever saw one. Thank \r\nyou. ",

        "Livvie: Hey, I brought you another Christmas present. It's to replace the one \r\nthat got smashed. ",
        "Livvie: I didn't make it, like I did the last one, but the feeling behind it \r\nis pretty much the same. ",
        "Kevin: How did you know I needed this? ",
        "Livvie: Well, better late than never, right? ",
        "Kevin: Right. Better late than never. Thank you. Well, this goes with me \r\neverywhere. ",
        "Victor: Monk? Monk, do you have -- oh, Livvie, I'm sorry. Was I interrupting \r\nsomething? ",
        "Kevin and Livvie: No. ",
        "Livvie: Not at all. I'm just getting ready to put a pot of coffee on. ",
        "Kevin: Great idea. I think we should christen this mug. ",
        "Livvie: Hmm. ",
        "Kevin: Victor, what's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost. ",
        "Victor: Mac was right. There isn't an easy way to tell you this. I know who \r\nkilled Eve. ",

        "Ian: Eve? Eve, you sleeping? ",
        "Eve: Not anymore. ",
        "Ian: I didn't mean to wake you. ",
        "Eve: What's going on? Why is the lab so clean? Where are Harris' notes? ",
        "Ian: All right here in my noggin. I memorized the formula and then destroyed \r\nthe paperwork. ",
        "Eve: What? Before I even got a chance to look at them? Why would you do that?\r\n",
        "Ian: I -- ",
        "Harris: I'm glad to find you two awake. We have a busy day ahead of us. ",
        "Ian: Give us a moment. ",
        "Ian: It isn't time yet. ",
        "Harris: I'm dying, Thornhart. It better damn well be time. Besides, I thought \r\nyou wanted Eve out of here as soon as possible. ",
        "Ian: I do, so give us a moment. ",
        "Harris: Oh, so you can say your goodbyes? Ugh, make it short and sweet. I'm \r\nsick enough as it is. ",
        "Eve: Ian, what's going on out here? First you destroy the notes so that I'm \r\ncompletely out of the loop, and now you're out here whispering with him. Did you \r\nmake some kind of a deal that I'm not aware of? You did, didn't you? ",
        "Ian: You're going home, today, alone. ",
        "Eve: No, I am not. We are in this together. Period. ",
        "",
        "Victor: We think a man named Jordan Harris is responsible for the bombing. At \r\nleast that's what all my sources tell me. Actually, he's one of the suspects \r\nthat Mac and I traced to Ian earlier. ",
        "Kevin: You've got to find him, Victor. I have to know who murdered Eve. ",
        "Victor: I had such mixed feelings about saying anything that would add to \r\nyour grief, but I thought you ought to know. ",
        "Kevin: You did the right thing to tell me. Besides, I can handle this better \r\nnow, especially after last night. ",
        "Victor: Last night was amazing. Nearly as amazing as the force behind it. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's Lucy. Nothing's ever stopped her yet. ",
        "Victor: She really is amazingly devoted to you. ",
        "Livvie: Anyone for that coffee? ",
        "Victor: Uh -- no, thank you. I really have to be off. Monk, I'll talk to you \r\nlater about that other thing. ",
        "Kevin: Good. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, Victor didn't have to stop talking when I came in about you and \r\nLucy. I mean, I know you guys were like soul mates. Anyone can see that \r\nconnection between you. Kind of practically lights up a room. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy lights up about a lot of things -- red roses, party hats, good \r\nshoes. ",
        "Livvie: Look, I know I didn't know Eve very well, but I do know how much you \r\nlove her and probably will love her for the rest of your life, but there's just \r\nthis bond between you and Lucy that can't be denied. ",
        "Kevin: You know, I know you just made the coffee, but I remembered I have to \r\ndo something. You want to come along? ",
        "Livvie: Cool. Road trip with Dad. Yeah. ",
        "",
        "Eve: You cannot expect me to walk away from you, Ian. We are a package deal, \r\nok? He stays, I stay. ",
        "Harris: Well, that's fine by me. You're much easier on the eyes than your \r\npartner here. Besides, I'd like to get to know you better. ",
        "Ian: Hey, hey -- there's only one deal on the table and I will not treat you \r\nuntil Eve is safe in Port Charles. I'm the only one who knows the formula to the \r\ncure, so you want me. Now, please, step outside and let us talk. ",
        "Harris: Wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, Thornhart? ",
        "Eve: You arrogant, self-centered jerk. What gives you the right to barter \r\nwith your life like that? ",
        "Ian: The same thing that gave you the right to barter with your body. ",
        "Eve: I was trying to save your life, ok? You almost died in my arms after you \r\ndrank that poison. ",
        "Ian: Harris knows he can get to me as long as you're here. You're his weapon.\r\n",
        "Eve: And after I leave? Who's going to watch your back? ",
        "Ian: Once you're safe, I'll find a way to escape. Besides, once you're at \r\nhome, you can call the police. ",
        "Eve: Escape? Escape how? How? After I leave, what's to stop Harris from killing you after he receives \r\nhis treatments? ",
        "Ian: Lambert, you're going home. That's the end of it. ",
        "Eve: No. No, ok? There's got to be another way, all right? We'll brainstorm. \r\nWe'll stay up all night -- think of something else --",
        "Ian: We can't -- no, we don't have all night. We're running out of time. ",
        "Eve: I can't leave you. ",
        "Ian: Yes, you can. And you will. Go home. Do it for me. ",
        "",
        "Karen: Must be a full moon. What, this is the seventh run today? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, holidays always bring out the best in people. ",
        "Joe: All right, what do we got? ",
        "Emilio: Ted Harmon. A neighbor of his called it in.\r\nNear-syncopal episode. Skin's hot to the touch. ",
        "Frank: He's also got an old wound to the right lower extremity. Wouldn't let \r\nus start a line. Obviously, the guy's temperament's a little labile. ",
        "Joe: All right, we'll go easy on him. Just relax. ",
        "Frank: Apparently Ted's been here before. He's a Desert Storm vet, suffers from Gulf War \r\nSyndrome. Not too crazy about hospitals. ",
        "Emilio: Can you blame him? ",
        "Gabriela: Don't worry, Mr. Harmon, we'll take good care of you. ",
        "Ted: No -- where are you taking me? ",
        "Joe: We're just going to examine you, ok? ",
        "Ted: You're not my doctor! I want my doctor! ",
        "Joe: Take it easy. Calm down. ",
        "Ted: Get Dr. Collins! ",
        "",
        "Lucy: Whoopsie. ",
        "Alison: Here you are. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you, Alison. Hey, by the way, did you know that chamomile tea \r\nprovides balance in your life and that harmony is a buzz word for the new year, \r\nhmm? ",
        "Alison: Hmm, well, the only buzz word that I need is from that incredibly boxed babe over there. Oh, um, Lucy, listen, \r\nI'm really sorry that I missed Kevin's party that you threw. You know, after all \r\nthat stuff with Cedric, I really owe him a lot. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, you know what? Kevin understood. And luckily, for all of us \r\n-- hmm -- people showed up when they needed to. That was what was important. ",
        "Alison: Oh, good. ",
        "Lucy: This has been fun. I got to go. I really, really, really just have to \r\ngo. ",
        "Alison: Wait, but you -- ",
        "Lucy: Ta! ",
        "Alison: Didn't finish your tea. ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Hello. ",
        "Lucy: Hi. Um, hi. Uh, what are you doing here? I mean, you know, here of all \r\nplaces.",
        "Kevin: I'm staring down my darkest night, facing the place that almost \r\ndestroyed me with the two people who helped me survive it. ",
        "Kevin: It's hard to make sense of it. Eve is dead and life goes on just like \r\nbefore. ",
        "Livvie: This is the first night you've been back here since the explosion, \r\nisn't it? ",
        "Kevin: Yeah. I mean, inside people are laughing, carrying on like nothing \r\never happened. Somehow you just don't think the world will be the same. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, you know, it isn't the same. It can't be the same. When you love \r\nsomebody, it changes the world just a little bit. You loved Eve and you \r\nconnected with her and you made her happy. Even if it was just for a very short \r\ntime. ",
        "Livvie: And I know from experience what Lucy said is true. I mean, what you \r\nboth did, reaching out to me, it really changed my life. You guys taught me so \r\nmuch -- about family, about loyalty, about just plain old sticking it out when \r\nthe going gets tough. ",
        "Lucy: Well, that's me, one hardheaded, stick-to-it, stubborn gal, I guess.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Oh -- ",
        "Kevin: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Livvie: Lucy, you took me off the street and you didn't even know my name or \r\nwho I was. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you needed help. That was enough for me, ok? Ok. ",
        "Livvie: You are an incredible woman. My dad is so lucky to have you in his \r\nlife. ",
        "Lucy: Stop with the mushy stuff, ok? ",
        "Livvie: No, seriously -- ",
        "Lucy: No, you'll make me cry. ",
        "Livvie: You guys both taught me so much about love and that it's just not a \r\nmatter of give and take, and sometimes you just got to keep on giving until the \r\nother person catches up. Thank you. And you, too. ",
        "Kevin: Oh. ",
        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Wow. ",
        "Kevin: Wow. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You have a pretty terrific kid there, Doc, you know? ",
        "Kevin: Well, no argument there. But she's right. I am lucky to have you in my \r\nlife. Lucy, I -- I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't know what I would \r\ndo without you. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Look, no matter how hell-bent you are on doing this, I am not letting \r\nyou commit suicide. ",
        "Ian: Well, you think I'm just going to sit there and have him kill me? No. I \r\nwas hoping to maybe get to see you again after this. ",
        "Eve: Good. I just don't want you giving up. ",
        "Ian: You know me better than that. I've never given up on anything in my \r\nlife. ",
        "Eve: Ok, so, what's the game plan, then? ",
        "[Ian sighs] ",
        "Ian: The game plan -- there is nothing I can do while he has you in his \r\ngrasp. ",
        "Eve: I don't like the way this is going. ",
        "Ian: Ok, I don't, either, but would you please just listen -- listen to what \r\nI have to say once in your lifetime. Lambert, please! I don't trust him to take \r\nyou back to Port Charles safely. We need to come up with some kind of code so I \r\nknow that you're ok. ",
        "Eve: Ok, now, that assumes that I'm going, which I'm not! ",
        "Ian: Some kind of word that I only would understand. ",
        "Eve: Ok. How about if I just call you stupid! ",
        "Ian: That's good, but everybody calls me that, so that's not going to work.\r\n",
        "Eve: Ian, you can't make me leave you. ",
        "Ian: What about that drink you had at Jake's? Kamikaze? Perfect. ",
        "Eve: Uh-huh. You remember what happened to me at Jake's when I had that \r\nkamikaze? I fell right off the bar. ",
        "Ian: And do you remember that I caught you? I was there for you and I will be \r\nthere for you now. But you have to follow the plan. ",
        "Eve: I hate this. I hate this so much. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, well, I don't like it, either. But you will call me as soon as you \r\nget back to Port Charles and you're safe. ",
        "Eve: What about you? ",
        "Ian: When I know that you're safe, I will end this little game with Harris \r\nonce and for all. Come on, don't do this. This isn't a time for tears, huh? Some time to be sad. You're going home. And I will do the right thing. Believe \r\nit. ",
        "Eve: I know you will. I know you will. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: According to his chart, he was supposed to be seeing Dr. Collins \r\nregularly, but he stopped coming six months ago. ",
        "Ted: You're not poking anything in me or giving me drugs, you hear me? I had \r\nenough of that stuff in Kuwait -- vaccines, chemical warfares. Nobody's touching \r\nmy body anymore! ",
        "Gabriela: Mr. Harmon, you've got a fever, you're getting yourself all upset.\r\n",
        "Joe: Let's give him two grams of ceftriaxone to start -- I.V. piggyback. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok. ",
        "Ted: You'll be sorry if you come any closer. ",

        "Joe: Hey, we don't want to hurt you. ",
        "Ted: I've heard that before. This time I'm not buying your lies. You touch me \r\nagain and I'll blow everyone in this lousy place sky high.",
        "",
        "Alison: I just don't think that Livvie should be setting up her dad when Eve \r\nis barely in her grave. I mean, that's got to be, like, breaking some kind of \r\nmajor rule of dating etiquette. ",
        "Jamal: Look, the doc is hurt bad, ok? I mean, maybe Livvie just wanted him to \r\nget out a little, you know? Stop dwelling in the pain. ",
        "Alison: Well, Eve was a good person and she really helped us out when we were \r\nin trouble, and I'm not just going to pretend like she didn't exist. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: So -- ",
        "Jamal: I mean, she's gone now, you know, so -- ",
        "Alison: Wait, am I like the only person who thinks that this stinks? I mean, \r\nis that what you would do if, you know, something happened to me? Just take the \r\nnext person on the list? ",
        "Jamal: Who you got named on that list, though? ",
        "Alison: I'm serious. ",
        "Jamal: Baby, all right, stop, stop. Ok, as far as I'm concerned, you are that \r\nlist. Ok, there's no before or after you. All right? So don't go there. Don't.\r\n",
        "Alison: Ok. ",

        "Lucy: We are both very, very lucky, Doc. I mean, we've always had, always, \r\nthis great friendship. ",
        "Kevin: We're more than friends, Lucy, and you know that. Time and again, \r\nyou've thrown me a lifeline when I needed it most. And how is it you always know \r\nthe right thing to do or say? ",
        "Lucy: Uh, lucky to be in the right place at the right time. I guess it's just \r\ncalled destiny. ",
        "Kevin: I've been at rock bottom ever since Eve died. But it was you that got \r\nme back on my feet. How do you thank someone for saving your life? ",
        "Lucy: How about dinner? ",
        "Kevin: Well, I get off easy. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, I tell you what -- I will take care of the dinner and you have \r\nyourself officially reinstated at G.H., ok? ",
        "Kevin: Does that mean that you're going to -- cook? ",
