        "Alison's voice: \"To my dearest little \r\none, tomorrow I am marrying the most wonderful man in the entire world. By the \r\ntime you think to ask about things like this, you'll have known your father \r\nevery minute of your life and you'll probably think that the two of us being \r\ntogether is the most normal, everyday thing. But the truth is our love has never \r\nbeen ordinary. We had to go to heaven and almost to hell and back to be \r\ntogether. But I want you to know we are so blessed. And it's this feeling, the \r\ndepth of the bond that we share, that someday we'll be ready to start thinking \r\nabout starting a family of our own. So get ready, kiddo. Mom's got a few things \r\nyou need to know.\" ",

Things have \r\nchanged so fast, haven't they? Just to think that we're so much in love. It \r\nfeels like it's been -- ",
        "Stephen: Forever. ",
        "Elizabeth: Exactly. I know I was so \r\nscared at first, but now that I have you, when we're together like this, it's \r\njust -- I can have it all, thanks to you. But you know what that feels like, \r\ndon't you, Stephen? To have one person be your whole world? ",
        "Elizabeth: Stephen? ",
        "Stephen: You're tired, sweetheart. Go \r\nto sleep. ",

        "Livvie: Where are you, Caleb? It's \r\nChristmas night and everyone has someone to share the lights and the decorations \r\nwith, and all I keep thinking of is you. ",

        "Livvie: Couldn't sleep either, huh?\r\n",
        "Tess: I close my eyes, I can see your \r\nbody down by the river and he's screaming and he's pulling me out of you. \n",
        "Livvie: Shh. Tess, you don't have to \r\nbe scared. You're a part of me, and if I'm not scared, you shouldn't be either.\r\n",
        "Tess: What is it about him, the man \r\nyou call Caleb, the reason you feel so connected? ",
        "Livvie: \"Connected\"? Is that what you \r\nreally mean, Tess? ",
        "Tess: I don't understand. ",
        "Livvie: Go ahead, ask it. How can I \r\nlove Caleb, knowing what he really is? ",

        "Alison's voice: \"Because don't think \r\nthe love of your life is just going to walk in the door and hit you on the head. \r\nWell, sometimes it does, and sometimes it sneaks up on us and we fall in love \r\nalong the way. No matter what, you've got four things you need to remember, and \r\nyou just have to trust me on this. Number one -- always keep lots of jelly \r\naround the house. Number two -- learn how to make really neat shapes in the \r\nsnow. Keep making them, too, for the rest of your life.\" ",

        "Tess: Caleb? ",
        "Livvie: Caleb. He didn't just show up \r\nin this town by accident, Tess. It was my hunger, my needs that brought him back \r\nto Port Charles in the first place. ",
