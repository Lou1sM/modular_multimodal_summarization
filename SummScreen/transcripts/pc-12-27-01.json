        "Alison: I'm so bummed that we didn't get to spend the holidays together. I \r\nmiss you like crazy. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I miss you like crazy, too. But we'll be together soon. ",
        "Alison: I know, but it's just such a magical time of the year, you know? And \r\nI -- I'm just so sad that it's come and gone so fast. ",
        "Jamal: Look, we'll have our own celebration once we both get back there, ok?\r\n",
        "Alison: Well, what I'd rather celebrate is Hope and Gabby pulling through. \r\nHow are they doing? ",
        "Jamal: Well, Gabby is being prepped. She's about to go into surgery. And Hope \r\nis -- she's hanging in there. So, I mean -- well, the doctors are saying \r\neverything looks good. ",
        "Alison: Oh, that's so good. That's so great to hear. Listen, I'm going to go \r\ncall again to see if the airport has reopened or not because I want to get there \r\nreally soon. I really want to be there for you through all of this. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I want you here, too, baby. I can't stand being away from you \r\nthis long. I love you, too. Ok. Bye. Hey. So what's the latest? ",
        "Valerie: The doctor's about to prep Gabby now, and they're almost ready to \r\nstart. ",
        "",
        "Nurse: Your vitals look good, Miss Garza. Won't be long now. It's a wonderful \r\nthing you're doing for this little girl. ",
        "Gabriela: Thank you. Well, I'm glad I can. ",
        "Ricky: Oh, pardon me. I was just on my way to see our patient. This is \r\nGabriela Garza's room, isn't it? ",
        "Nurse: Yes, but -- ",
        "Ricky: You don't recognize me. I'm her personal doctor. I'm just here to make \r\nsure that she's more comfortable. ",
        "Nurse: How nice. ",
        "Ricky: Great. Now, if you'll excuse me. ",
        "Ricky: Hello, Gigi. The doctor is in. ",
        "Gabriela: Ricky, what are you doing here? And when did you get out of jail?\r\n",
        "",
        "Kevin: Listen, we need to make this transition for Christina as smooth as \r\npossible. She and Julie need a chance to say goodbye to each other before we \r\ntake her home. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, right. You're right. Let's go. ",
        "Kevin: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: Look, I know that's the right thing we should be doing and it's logical \r\nand it's sensible, but, Doc, it scares the hell out of me. ",
        "Kevin: Why? ",
        "Lucy: Because Julie tricked us before. What if this is just another one of \r\nher crazy plans? ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Julie is dying. I saw her medical records. ",
        "Lucy: I know, I know, and I'm very sorry. But I can't help this bad feeling. \r\nI know I'm acting crazy, but I just have a bad feeling. ",
        "Kevin: It's going to be ok. ",
        "Lucy: What if it's not? What if it's not? What if Julie just can't bear to \r\nsay goodbye and so she runs and she takes Christina again? Doc, I couldn't go \r\nthrough losing her again, I couldn't. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, Lucy, it's not going to happen. ",
        "Lucy: Let's make sure of it. Let's go home. Let's just go home, the three of \r\nus, right now and never let her out of our sight, never. Trust. ",
        "Kevin: What? ",
        "Lucy: Trust. I -- I trusted in the universe all my life. I trusted in you. We \r\nended up married, right? Trusted in our love. So I need to trust in this, don't \r\nI? Ok, just for her. Just for our daughter. ",
        "Kevin: You always manage to get there in your own way. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "",
        "Jamal: I thought Gabby was supposed to be going into surgery. I mean, how \r\ncome they haven't come and got us yet? ",
        "Valerie: I don't know. They must still be prepping her. ",
        "Jamal: Look, well, I don't want her going under until I see her, ok? I need \r\nto see her first. ",
        "Valerie: You will, you will. Don't worry. The doctors and nurses know that \r\nyou're waiting out here, and I'm sure Gabby wouldn't have anyone wheel her off \r\nwithout seeing you first. ",
        "Jamal: You're right, you're right. You're right. I'm just -- I'm just \r\ntripping out. Thank you. ",
        "Valerie: I'm the one that should be thanking you. I mean, you've done so much \r\nfor me and Hope. ",
        "Jamal: Well, I appreciate everything you're saying. I really do. But just so \r\nwe're clear -- ok, I'm not making any claims to Hope after the surgery's over.\r\n",
        "Valerie: I know. ",
        "Jamal: Good. Because I really believe that she'll have the best life with the \r\nHartmans. That's all I want for her. ",
        "Valerie: And I want her to have the best life, too. I was just saying, I'm \r\nglad you're here -- that we're all here to help her through. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, you know, Gabby, most of all, if you're looking for \r\nheroes. I mean, she's the one. ",
        "",
        "Gabriela: How did you get out of jail, Ricky? And how did you know I was \r\nhere? ",
        "Ricky: We haven't seen each other in, what, three years? And the first thing \r\nyou do is hammer me with questions? Whatever happened to, \"It's so good to see \r\nyou, Ricky. I have missed you so much, Ricky. I'm so glad that you found me, \r\nRicky?\" You're still as feisty as ever. You haven't changed. ",
        "Gabriela: And you still haven't answered either one of my questions. ",
        "Ricky: Ah. Ok. The state cut me a deal, all right? Time off for good \r\nbehavior. I got sprung six months early. ",
        "Gabriela: Good behavior? ",
        "Ricky: Maybe I turned over a new leaf, huh? What? That doesn't even get a \r\nsmile? ",
        "Gabriela: Not until you give me an answer to question number two. What are \r\nyou doing here? ",
        "Ricky: Guess. ",
        "Gabriela: You need money. Forgery business not going so well for you? ",
        "Ricky: Ooh. Cheap shot, Gigi. ",
        "Gabriela: Ok, come on, Ricky. You know what? No more games. ",
        "Ricky: All right, fine. Look, I got worried about you -- all right? -- When I \r\nstopped getting your letters. And then when I got out, and I looked for you in \r\nPort Charles, I got more worried because I couldn't find you. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, there has been a lot going on in my life recently. And we can \r\ndiscuss all of that some other time. But right now, I'm needed in surgery. ",
        "Ricky: Ding, ding, ding. You just said the magic word. ",
        "Gabriela: What? ",
        "Ricky: You see, the real reason why I'm here is to stop you because the only \r\nway that you're donating a kidney tonight is over my dead body. ",

        "Julie: Hello, Lucy. ",
        "Lucy: Julie. ",
        "Julie: Oh, I love watching her when she sleeps. ",
        "Kevin: Well, she's had a pretty big day. I think I'm going to set her down.\r\n",
        "Julie: Thanks, Kevin. Here. ",
        "Chris: She's gotten so big. She looks just like you. ",
        "Julie: How was she tonight? ",
        "Kevin: Incredible. ",
        "Julie: I'm so glad. ",
        "Kevin: You've done an amazing job getting her ready for this, Julie. ",
        "Lucy: You really, really have. Kevin has told me everything you've done, \r\neverything. ",
        "Julie: Everything? ",
        "Lucy: I'm really sorry -- very, very sorry about what you're having to go \r\nthrough. Actually, I was kind of hoping if it's ok we could have some time \r\nalone, you know? ",
        "Chris: You know, it's not really ok. Actually, I'd like you both to leave. \r\nYou can come see Christina tomorrow. ",
        "Julie: Chris, please, wait -- ",
        "Chris: Please, let me handle this. ",
        "Julie: No, I appreciate you wanting to help me, but I'm fine. Lucy and I do \r\nneed to talk. ",
        "Kevin: We'll wait outside. ",
        "Kevin: For what it's worth, I'm sorry. This can't be easy for you. ",
        "Chris: You know what it's worth, Collins? Nothing. You're not sorry. You and \r\nLucy got exactly what you wanted -- Julie's dying, and Christina's all yours. \r\nMerry Christmas. ",

        "Julie: It's ok, Lucy. You can ask me anything. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Did the -- I mean, did the doctors say how long? ",
        "Julie: Weeks. Maybe a couple of months. Soon, basically. ",
        "Lucy: I see. Well, Christina -- does she know? ",
        "Julie: She knows I'm sick and that I'll be going to heaven soon to be an \r\nangel. ",

        "Gabriela: So, what, you're just going to stop my surgery? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, that's right. ",
        "Gabriela: You can't just waltz back into my life and try to control it. Who \r\ndo you think you are? ",
        "Ricky: Someone who cares about you more than anyone else. You know that, Gigi.\r\n",
        "Gabriela: What I know is that this is my business and not yours. I am \r\ndonating a kidney to save a little girl's life whether you like it or not. ",

        "Gabriela: There is no one else! I'm it, end of story. ",

        "Kevin: No one's happy about these circumstances, Chris. ",
        "Chris: All you really care about is the fact that Lucy has Christina. That's \r\nall that matters to you or anyone else in this town. No one gives a damn about \r\nJulie. ",
        "Kevin: All right, you believe what you want. But I've done everything that \r\nJulie asked me to do. ",
        "Chris: You should have called me the second you knew she was back in town. I \r\nshould be the one helping -- ",
        "Kevin: You must have read her chart. Then you know that there's nothing \r\nmedically that anyone could have done for her. ",
        "Chris: If I had known earlier, there might have been something. ",
        "Kevin: There was nothing you could have done. There wasn't anything anyone \r\ncould have done -- then or now. ",
        "Chris: I'm not talking to you about this. ",
        "Kevin: Well, then listen. Julie's made her peace. I know you want to fix it, \r\nand if I were in your shoes, I'd want to do the same thing, but you can't. Just \r\nlet her finish what she needs to do. Let her finish things the way she wants \r\nthem -- for her and Christina. ",
        "",
        "Julie: I guess Winnie the Pooh is her favorite. But she's a sucker for \r\nanything princess -- Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Ariel. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, aren't we all? ",
        "Julie: And as you can see, she's got every Disney video. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, wow, \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Dumbo.\" ",
        "Julie: Yeah. Oh, but this one is her all-time favorite video and TV show. \r\n\"Bear in the Big Blue House.\" ",
        "Lucy:  Bear in the Big Blue House? ",
        "Julie: Yeah. Oh, it's this wonderful bear and his sidekick mouse. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, ok, so it's on TV? ",
        "Julie: Yeah, yeah. Seven a.m. every morning. She'll be at the TV. Oh, which reminds me, her nap schedule. Basically, she gets up at the \r\ncrack of dawn, and I usually try and get her to take a nap around 1:30, but good \r\nluck getting her down. ",
        "Lucy: Well, it doesn't really surprise me. She probably doesn't want to miss \r\nout on anything. ",
        "Julie: Exactly. But giving her a blankie and a sippy cup helps. I'll have \r\nDeena write this all down for you before you go. ",
        "Lucy: Deena -- that must have been the woman I saw when I followed Kevin \r\nhere. ",
        "Julie: You followed Kevin here? ",
        "Lucy: Uh -- yeah, I did, but I -- I chickened out. ",
        "Julie: She's my nurse and Christina's nanny. I'm sorry I was so secretive, \r\nLucy, or if I caused any problems for you and Kevin. I just didn't want things \r\nhappening too fast, you know. I didn't want to confuse Christina by having \r\nthings change suddenly. ",
        "Lucy: I do understand that. ",
        "Julie: But she's really prepared for this change -- as much as she can be. \r\nI've been showing her pictures of you for months now and telling her we were on \r\nan adventure to reunite her with her other mommy. She really sees you that way \r\n-- as her other mommy, just like I am. Oh, she has been excited to see you. She \r\ntalks about you all the time. I -- I don't think you'll have any trouble making \r\nher comfortable. ",
        "Lucy: Thank you. I sure know that was not easy. ",
        "Julie: Actually, it was. Because all I care about is making my little girl \r\nhappy. And I know that you'll do that. ",
        "Lucy: Yes, I will. That's all I care about, too. I'm -- I'm so sorry. ",
        "Julie: What is it? ",
        "Lucy: I so appreciate everything you've done. I find it unbelievable. I am \r\nfeeling so blessed and so lucky to have Christina back in my life. It means the \r\nworld to me, but I -- I have to just say this, and I hate myself in a way for \r\nsaying it, but, Julie, I hated you. I -- I -- I hated you for what you did to \r\nme. I -- I loved that little girl, and you took her away, and I was dead inside. \r\nIt was like my heart was going to stay broken forever. ",
        "Julie: I don't blame you for hating me. I don't. I would hate me, too, and \r\nwhat I did. What I did was selfish and it was wrong. Oh, but, Lucy, the one true \r\nthing is how much I love my little girl. I couldn't bear to be separated from \r\nher, and I didn't care who I hurt. I'm sorry you missed that year of Christina's \r\nlife. But that year with her, it made my life, Lucy. She taught me so much. She \r\nmade me somebody I could finally be proud of. ",

        "Chris: You're right. The most important thing here is what's best for \r\nChristina -- and making Julie's last days more comfortable. ",
        "Kevin: I'm glad you see that. Look, I rented the suite next to Julie for me \r\nand Lucy, but I need to go down and make some more arrangements. ",
        "Chris: Oh, go ahead. ",
        "Kevin: So we're all on the same page here? ",
        "Chris: Yes, we want what's best for Christina, obviously. ",
