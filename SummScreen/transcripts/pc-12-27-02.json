        "Tess: Her big day. I'm just so happy \r\nfor her. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, wait till you see a \r\nBarrington wedding. It's probably going to be huge. It'll be pretty awesome.\r\n",
        "Jack: So what was that for? \n",
        "Tess: Thank you for not being afraid \r\nto love me. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, you really didn't \r\ngive me much of a choice, did you? So where's Livvie, anyway? ",
        "Tess: Don't know. She's been gone all \r\nmorning. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll turn \r\nup. She always does. But I will see you at the church. ",

        "Lucy: I am so glad Ididn't leave this \r\nto the florist. Otherwise, it would've not been quite as beautiful without my \r\nperfect little touch. Ooh, that is perfect, thanks to me. Thank you, thank you, \r\nthank you. Hi. ",
        "Ian: Hi. ",
        "Lucy: You're so early. I mean, the \r\nwedding doesn't start for quite a while. ",
        "Ian: I know when the wedding starts. \r\nRafe asked me to set up with him. ",
        "Lucy: Me, too. He didn't say anything \r\nabout you to me, about you being with me -- ",
        "Ian: Well, he probably has a lot on \r\nhis mind, don't you think? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I guess he does. \n",
        "Ian: Yeah. Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, don't -- no, don't do \r\nthat, ok? I hate the way it is between us right now. I have so many things I \r\nwant to tell you, starting with I should have never slapped you like that at the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Ian: You were sticking up for your \r\nhusband and you made your point. ",
        "Lucy: But my husband has done some \r\nthings I want to talk to you about. ",
        "Ian: Save it. ",

        "[Music stops] ",
        "Alison: Don't you know that it's bad \r\nluck for the groom and the bride to see each other before the wedding? \n",
        "Rafe: No. Nothing could be bad luck \r\nabout seeing you. ",
        "Alison: Ah! Are you sure? Never?\r\n",

        "Rafe's voice: And let's not forget \r\nabout her mother, Elizabeth -- you know, the woman you bit? You took your fangs \r\nand you sunk them into her neck. You turned her. ",

        "Stephen: Yeah, that's exactly what \r\nIneed in my life, Livvie -- two of you. ",
        "Livvie: Well, there are two of us. We \r\ntried putting all the pieces together, figuring it out. So we worked on it \r\ntogether, we remembered together. We still don't know how, but we do know that \r\nyou pulled Tess out of me. You loved me so much that you wanted two of me, so \r\nyou made her. ",
        "Stephen: Oh, you don't have much of an \r\nego problem, do you? ",
        "Livvie: I'm not going to bother \r\nchasing you around anymore. I'm just going to wait for you instead. And when you \r\ncan't fight the hunger, you'll know how to find me. ",

        "Joshua: This has got to stop. \n",
        "Stephen: Don't do that. ",
        "Joshua: Look at you. She makes you \r\ncareless, and you know it. How much more proof do you need that she's a danger \r\nto us? Please let me get rid of her. ",
        "Stephen: I said no. Nothing's changed.\r\n",
        "Joshua: That woman will be the death \r\nof you, and not for the first time. ",

        "Lucy: \"Enough\"? Hey, we're friends. \r\nWe're best friends, so can't we find a way to at least be together that --\r\n",
        "Ian: No, we can't. You want to be with \r\nKevin, and that's fine, and if I had any respect for the man, I could deal with \r\nit. But I don't and I can't, and that's it. ",
        "Lucy: Please, though, at least let's \r\ntalk -- ",
        "Ian: I told you how I feel about you. \r\nI can't tell you how to live your life. And I can't rescue someone that doesn't \r\nwant to be saved, so just be with Kevin, all right? ",
        "Lucy: It's just he is my husband.\r\n",
        "Ian: I know who he is. So be with him \r\nand be happy. ",
        "Lucy: It's that simple? So, hey, we \r\nwere friends for a while, and now good-bye, adios, so long? Is that ? \n",
        "Ian: Yeah, that's it. ",
        "Lucy: So after everything we've been \r\nthrough together, that's it, that's it, that's it? Fine. ",

        "Lucy: He didn't accept. I need to go. \r\nI got to go check on Rafe. ",

        "Rafe: Yeah, it's actually -- well, \r\nit's sort of an antique. I mean, it belonged to my mother. And I guess I just \r\nwanted you to have something of hers today. ",
