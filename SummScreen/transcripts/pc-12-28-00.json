        "Kevin: Will you look at this place?",
        "Lucy: I am looking. Whoa. No, don't look at me. I didn't have anything to do \r\nwith all of this. ",
        "Kevin: You mean you're as surprised as I am? ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Um -- however, I am a lot better at snooping than you are. ",
        "Kevin: What is that? ",
        "Lucy: It's a note with your name on it. ",
        "Kevin: \"Dear Dad, I hope you and Lucy enjoy this surprise. Livvie.\" ",
        "Lucy: That is so amazing. Do you know how much trouble she went to to set all \r\nof this up? ",
        "Kevin: I know. It's really sweet. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. And really romantic. You know, I -- I just -- I just think it \r\nwould be terrible for us if we feel, you know, ever feel uncomfortable being \r\nalone like this together -- ",
        "Kevin: You know what, Lucy? ",
        "Lucy: No, I'm serious. Maybe we better go somewhere with less candles and \r\nmore bright light. ",
        "Kevin: I think we should make the most of the evening just the way it is, \r\njust you and me. What do you say? ",
        "",
        "Ian: You ok? ",
        "Eve: Yeah. Yeah. You? ",
        "Ian: Told you I could fly this thing. ",
        "Eve: Don't quit your day job. ",
        "Ian: It makes you feel alive, doesn't it? ",
        "Eve: I'm just lucky that we are alive, ok? Do you have any idea where we \r\nlanded? ",
        "Ian: With a little luck, not too far from help. ",
        "Eve: Oh, luck. Now, there's a concept. ",
        "Ian: Let me help you with this, then we can move on. ",
        "Eve: Move on to where? ",
        "Ian: I don't know. First we'll get out of here, see where we are, and we'll \r\ngo from there. ",
        "Eve: And how exactly are we supposed to get out of here and see where we are \r\nwhen we don't even know where in the heck we are? ",
        "Ian: We walk. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Remind me again why dying of frostbite in the middle of the jungle is \r\nbetter than being killed by your friend Harris. ",
        "Ian: By the time we left, he was as much a friend to you as he was to me. ",
        "Eve: Oh, but I never would have met him if it hadn't been for you. Thank you.\r\n",
        "Ian: You're welcome. And by the way, we're not in a jungle here. It's a \r\nforest. ",
        "Eve: Are you trying to make me angry on purpose? ",
        "Ian: Anything to keep you warm. ",
        "Eve: Then why did you have me walk down the middle of an ice cold stream? My \r\nfeet are frozen. I can't feel a thing. ",
        "Ian: Well, it's too easy to track footmarks through the snow. It's a matter \r\nof survival. ",
        "Eve: Survival. You're the survival expert, so why can't you make us a shelter \r\nout of twigs and icicles or something? ",
        "Ian: I could, but we have to keep moving by the light of the moon, so let's \r\ngo. ",
        "Eve: I can't. ",
        "Ian: What do you mean, you can't? Of course you can. ",
        "Eve: I can't. I can't. I'm frozen. ",
        "Ian: Ok, then I'll carry you. ",
        "Eve: No. No, Ian. I can't do it anymore, ok? I'm tired. I can't do anything.\r\n",
        "Ian: Damn it, Lambert! Don't give up now. You have too much to live for. And \r\nif you want to stay alive, you got to keep moving, ok? I'm not staying and I'm \r\nnot leaving you here, so we're all out of choices. Lambert, for the love of God, \r\nHarris is dead and we've come too far, so don't give up now. Let's go. ",
        "Eve: You know, you can be really pushy when you want to be. ",
        "Ian: I know it. You can tell me all about my character flaws while we're \r\nwalking, all right? ",
        "Eve: I will. I will. And by the time I'm through with you, you're going to \r\nwish you had left me here to freeze. ",
        "Ian: I'm sorry already. Come on. Come on. ",
        "",
        "Frank: What did you expect me to say -- \"Hey, Mom, we just missed getting \r\nblown up by a Gulf War vet with a leftover grenade?\" ",
        "Joe: She's going to hear it sooner or later. ",
        "Frank: Later is better than sooner. Does anybody want something to drink? ",
        "Karen: Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I could really use a nice \r\nbig mug of hot chocolate. ",
        "Frank: Hot chocolate -- the perfect comfort food for almost getting blown \r\ninto marshmallow bits. All right. Coming right up. ",
        "Karen: Hey, do you need a hand? I'm an expert at it. ",
        "Frank: Bring them both. ",
        "Karen: Ok. ",
        "Joe: You're awful quiet. Gabby? You sure you're ok? ",
        "Gabriela: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? ",
        "Joe: Well, you just lived through a scene out of \"Apocalypse Now.\" ",
        "Gabriela: It wasn't that big a deal. ",
        "Joe: Well, it was to me. ",
        "Gabriela: Come on, Joe. We're all trained to deal with emergencies in the E.R. \r\nI know how to take care of myself. ",
        "Joe: Who said you didn't? I know how strong you are, what a pro you are. \r\nThat's not the point. ",
        "Gabriela: Then what is the point? ",
        "Joe: Being a pro doesn't mean you don't get scared. We wouldn't be human. ",
        "Gabriela: Well, I don't have to tell you I'm human, do I? ",
        "Joe: You don't have to tell me anything, as long as you know you can. When \r\nthere's the two of us, we don't have to be so strong. ",
        "Gabriela: We could have died. All of us. We all could have died. ",
        "Joe: But we didn't, Gabby. We're alive. Hey. It's ok. It's all right. I've \r\ngot you. ",
        "Gabriela: I hate this. I hate that he made me feel this way. ",
        "Joe: Shh. It's ok. Feel what you feel. Just know that you can lean on me \r\nsometimes, ok? That way, I can lean back sometimes, too. ",

        "Ian: There's a cabin. ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. ",
        "Ian: Come on. Hello? Anybody home? ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. Great, we can't get in. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, we can. ",
        "[glass breaks]",
        "Eve: Ian! ",
        "Ian: It's ok. They're not home, anyway. Watch the glass. ",
        "Eve: Ok. ",
        "Ian: Come on in. This is nice. ",
        "Eve: Oh, it must be somebody's summer cabin. ",
        "Ian: See if you can find something that will tell us where we are, all right? \r\nI'm going to start a fire. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Ok. Um -- phone book. Phone book. ",
        "Ian: From where? ",
        "Eve: Marlin. Marlin. ",
        "Ian: Marlin? ",
        "Eve: New York. Ian, this is about an hour away from Port Charles. We're only \r\nabout 40 miles away. ",
        "Ian: I don't care if it's 40 miles or five. Great. ",
        "Eve: Is it dead? ",
        "Ian: We're done walking for the night. Yes, it's dead. Sit down. Here. We got \r\nto thaw out for the night. Take your boots off. ",
        "Eve: What about Harris' goons? ",
        "Ian: Well, with Harris dead, I don't think they're going to follow us. ",
        "Eve: Do you really believe that? ",
        "Ian: Yes. ",
        "Eve: Do you think we're safe? ",
        "Ian: Yeah, I do -- from Harris, anyway. He's not the man you should worry \r\nabout. I'm the one who's about to kill you. ",

        "[Music plays] ",
        "Kevin: Tell you what -- why don't you at least try to relax, and I'll open \r\nthe wine. ",
        "Lucy: Well, I'm not so sure I can relax at all tonight, given what just \r\nhappened. You know, Doc, if you hadn't said what you said to that man, the exact \r\nright thing, then -- how did you know exactly the right thing to say? ",
        "Kevin: Actually, I rarely do. I just knew I couldn't let him hurt you. After \r\nthat, it's pretty much just instincts. ",
        "Lucy: Well, you definitely have some mighty fine instincts. ",
        "Kevin: Sometimes. Listen, why don't -- why don't you just go ahead and relax, \r\nand I'm -- I'm going to take a shower. And after that, we can do whatever you \r\nwant. We can have dinner, or I can take you home, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",
        "Kevin: I won't be long. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. I'll be here. I would not want to go anywhere else than be right \r\nhere with you. Oh. Ow. I wonder what in the world this is. Only one way to find \r\nout. ",
        "[Tape plays] ",
        "Kevin's voice: As to what this is about, it's how we feel about each other. ",
        "Kevin: Lucy, you know you might need this to open the wine. I took it \r\nupstairs the last time I opened a bottle -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc -- ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I am so sorry. I didn't know what this was. I just sat in the \r\nchair and it was in the chair. It doesn't have a label or anything. ",
        "Kevin: Just let me do it, please. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, I am sorry. You know, I -- I wanted to put it back in the right \r\nbox. I would never, ever do anything -- ",
        "Kevin: I know, I know. It's ok. You would never do anything to deliberately \r\nhurt me. ",
        "Lucy: No, I wouldn't. ",
        "Kevin: But we can't pretend that Eve never existed, either. I loved her. ",
        "Lucy: I know, and you still do. ",
        "Kevin: I'm not even close to getting past what happened, Lucy. But I can't \r\nchange it. All I can do is try to get on with my life. That's what I want, and \r\nthat's what I need. And I need my friends around to help me make that happen.\r\n",
        "Lucy: I'm right here, Doc. ",
        "Kevin: I'm counting on it. So, I am going to leave you with the corkscrew, \r\nand I'm going to take that shower. ",
        "Lucy: You take your time, and I will attempt to relax. ",
        "Lucy: You know, I'm glad I did what I did, Eve. You never deserved him, you \r\nknow. And he never, ever deserved you running away like that with Ian. You know, \r\nhe's a better man than that, and I am going to do everything in my power, \r\neverything I can to make sure that he has a chance to forget that you ever \r\nexisted. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Well, that's awfully nice of you, considering you're so ticked off at \r\nme. ",
        "Ian: You nearly got both of us killed walking back into Harris' place. That's after I \r\nmade a deal with the devil to get you out. What kind of a fool does that? ",
        "Eve: The kind that was trying to save your life. And now I think I'm starting \r\nto have second thoughts. ",
        "Ian: Well, your first thought should be to get warm. Let's get you by the \r\nfire. ",
        "Eve: Ok. Hey, you knew that you didn't have the formula for Harris. Why \r\ndidn't you tell me? ",
        "Ian: Because I wanted you out of the way and safe before I told him that \r\nthere was no cure. And there you were just waltzing back in. ",
        "Eve: Hey, I couldn't leave you. ",
        "Ian: What were you thinking, taking a chance like that? ",
        "Eve: I'd take it again, and I wouldn't regret it. ",
        "Ian: You're out of your mind. ",
        "Eve: Well, if I am, it's for all the right reasons. I -- I couldn't just walk \r\naway and let you die. Ok? And now my reward is freezing to death. Why can't I \r\nget warm? ",
        "Ian: Let's get these clothes off you. Come on. ",
        "Eve: My fingers can't move. ",
        "Ian: I'll do it. Hold still. There. Huh? You're getting better already, \r\nright? So, what's this -- you couldn't walk away from me? Why is that? ",
        "Eve: Because we've gotten so close. ",
        "Ian: Yeah, like we were the only two people that mattered. ",
        "Eve: And if I told you that I felt the exact same way, that no one in this \r\nworld matters to me more than you -- ",
        "Ian: And if it were true -- if it were true, then -- ",
        "Eve: What? ",
        "Ian: Then I would tell you what I've wanted to tell you for so long. ",
        "Eve: Ian, I have to tell you. I -- ",
        "Ian: Shh. Be careful what you say to a man who's fallen in love with you. ",
        "Eve: God, you don't think I feel the same way about you? You don't think that I \r\nlove you? Oh. Oh, God. ",
        "Ian: Oh, don't let this be a dream, please. ",
        "Eve: Oh. Oh, God. It's -- it's -- it's not a dream. Finally, it's not just a \r\ndream. ",

        "Karen: So, ready for a new year, new president? ",
        "Frank: What I'm ready for is some air. You feel like joining me? ",
        "Karen: Yeah, sure. I could use some fresh air. ",
        "Frank: It's kind of stuffy in there. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, a little. ",
        "Frank: I -- I can take you home if you're uncomfortable. ",
        "Karen: Meaning? ",
        "Frank: Joe and Gabby. They're pretty close these days. ",
        "Karen: And I'm happy for them. ",
        "Frank: If it were me, I'd be pissed. I mean, you know, you and Joe were so \r\nclose. When you find the person you think you'll spend the rest of your life with and \r\nyou find out you're wrong, it sucks. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, it does. But there's a reason for everything -- that's what I \r\nbelieve. So, you hang on and sooner or later, you'll find your way to the one \r\nyou love. ",
        "Frank: You think so? ",
        "Karen: Absolutely. I know so. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Oh, God, I've wanted you for so long. Oh, just like this. ",

        "Eve: Really? ",
        "Ian: Uh-huh. ",
        "Eve: Oh. ",
        "Ian: That's why I was leaving town -- because I wanted more and knowing that \r\nI'd never -- ",
        "Eve: Oh, God. ",
        "Ian: That we'd never -- ",
        "Eve: I lied to myself for so long. I told myself it was all just about work. \r\nAnd we were together so much, growing stronger, it was all just work. ",
        "Ian: Uh-huh. And now? ",
        "Eve: Now, oh, I want to be with you. I've known it since Christmas Eve. I \r\nthink I've known it longer than that, when we were kidnapped and thrown \r\ntogether. ",
        "Ian: Eve, I -- ",
        "Eve: But I just tried so hard to fight those feelings. ",
        "Ian: Eve -- ",
        "Eve: And now I think we were meant to be together, like we have no other \r\nchoice but to fall in love. ",
        "Ian: Shut up. ",
        "Eve: Huh? ",
        "Ian: Shut up. Shut up. ",

        "Kevin: Mmm. ",
        "Lucy: Are you sure you're ok? ",
        "Kevin: You know, I realize it's a bit of a 360, but it just hit me all of a \r\nsudden in the shower. I just feel like celebrating. ",
        "Lucy: Mmm. Because we're alive. I feel like celebrating, too, you know. Doc, \r\nwhen that poor man was holding that grenade on me in the E.R., I know I was \r\nsupposed to be thinking at any second I could die, but that's not what I was \r\nthinking about. ",
        "Kevin: What were you thinking about? ",
        "Lucy: You. And, of course, Serena and all the people that I love. I just kept \r\npicturing all of them standing there smiling their best smile when they're very \r\nhappy. ",
        "Kevin: Well, that's funny because all I could think about was you and how I \r\njust couldn't let all the life and love that you bring to everyone around you \r\njust disappear. ",
        "Lucy: You know, you're just the same. Despite everything you've been through, \r\nyou have so much love and life to give. ",
        "Kevin: And all I have to do is reach out and grab it, right? ",
        "Lucy: Mm-hmm, most definitely. You know, that's the advice you always give \r\nme. I mean, you've given it to me on many occasions. Doc, everybody who loves \r\nyou and, well, who has loved you -- that's what they want for you, but in your \r\nown time, when you're absolutely ready. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I know one thing -- it's time to start. ",
        "Lucy: Are you sure? ",
        "Kevin: Life is short, Lucy, and I've never been more sure about that than I \r\nam right at this moment. So I'm not about to waste another second. Come on. ",
        "Lucy: What? Ok. Where? Where? ",
        "Kevin: Oh, I don't know. How about bungee jumping? ",
        "Lucy: Bungee -- no. Doc. ",
        "Kevin: All right, fine. We'll just stay here, and we'll finish our dinner. \r\nAnd we'll just be together. After all the things that we could be doing in this \r\nlife right now at this moment, we'll just -- we'll just be together. ",
        "Lucy: Are you sure you haven't, you know, seen enough of me today? ",
        "Kevin: You already know the answer to that question, Lucy. ",
