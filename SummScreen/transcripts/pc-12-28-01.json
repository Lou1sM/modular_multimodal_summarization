        "Jack: So this is what the crack of dawn looks like, huh? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. It is, actually. Here, here's some coffee, ok? Super high \r\noctane. I totally appreciate you guys taking me to the bus station. ",
        "Livvie: So, how are things with Jamal? ",
        "Alison: Well, I called last night. I don't know. Something funky was going \r\non. I just -- I need to get to Chicago as soon as possible. ",
        "Jack: Let's rock and roll. ",
        "Livvie: Let's go. ",
        "Jack: No time to wait. I'll grab the suitcase. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Oh, wait! I forgot the stuffed animal that I bought for Hope. The \r\npoor kid's in the hospital. Just give me a second, ok? I'll be right back. ",

        "Jamal: This clown is your brother? ",

        "Jamal: You know, we can have a family reunion some other time, ok? Right now \r\nGabby is being prepped for surgery! ",
        "Ricky: No. See, there's no way that my sister's getting sliced. ",
        "Jamal: Is that right? ",
        "Gabriela: Damn it, Ricky, back off! ",
        "Valerie: There's no way he can do this, can he? ",
        "Jamal: No, Ricky is just fronting. So step off, brother. ",
        "Ricky: Who the hell do you think you're talking to, huh? ",
        "Dr. Hartman: What's going on here? Gabriela should be getting ready for the \r\noperation. ",
        "Gabriela: Everything is fine, Dr. Hartman. I'm just fine. Don't worry. ",
        "Ricky: You got one coming, bro, and I always pay my debts. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Yeah, listen, I am paying you for three fake I.D.s and a fast car out \r\nof town. Now, you call me when it's all arranged. ",

        "Julie: Deena's playing with her. ",
        "Chris: You know, you really should get to bed. You're going to need some \r\nrest. ",
        "Julie: Hey, I will have plenty of rest soon enough. Sorry. Bad joke. ",
        "Chris: Yeah. ",
        "Julie: Chris -- ",
        "Chris: You know, it's just not funny at all. ",

        "Kevin: Hey. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Hi, husband. ",
        "Kevin: Well, I like the sound of that. I brought a few things you might need, \r\nand, Julie, I managed to find your favorite muffins. ",
        "Julie: I'll save those for the road. ",
        "Lucy: What do you mean, \"the road?\" ",
        "Julie: It's time I say goodbye to Christina. Today's the day she goes home \r\nwith her mother. And now that's you, Lucy. ",

        "Livvie: Ok. ",
        "Jack: Alison, wake up. ",
        "Alison: Ow. What happened? ",
        "Livvie: Yes, we're right across the G.H. side entrance, so please hurry, \r\nplease. ",
        "Jack: Alison, lie still. ",
        "Alison: No -- ",
        "jack: You fell. You might have broken something. ",
        "Alison: I can't. I'm going to miss my bus. ",
        "Livvie: Alison, the paramedics are on their way. ",
        "Alison: Ouch. ",
        "Livvie: Are you in any pain? ",
        "Alison: No. I think I just -- I don't know. I got the wind knocked out of me \r\nor something. ",
        "Livvie: Jack, give me your scarf. ",
        "Alison: Please -- ow. ",
        "Livvie: Your head's bleeding. Honey, lay down, please? Lay down. ",

        "",
        "Jamal: Well, you don't need to be hanging here. ",
        "Ricky: I'm family. I've got every right to be here. ",
        "Dr. Hartman: Should I call security? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, why don't you do that and then you'll be the one looking for a \r\ndoctor, pal. ",
        "Jamal: I do not believe this guy. ",
        "Valerie: Look, my daughter's sick, all right? She needs Gabriela's help. ",
        "Ricky: And I'm saying that I'm sorry about all that. But you and your \r\ndaughter and your boyfriend mean nothing to me. ",
        "Gabriela: And I am saying for the last time that Hope will be fine because \r\nI'm donating my kidney, and that's final. And if you cause any more problems, I will call security. ",
        "Valerie: I need some air. ",
        "Dr. Hartman: There are too many distractions. You need to take Valerie and \r\nall the other extraneous people out of here. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on -- we're not just a bunch of strangers \r\nyou can push aside. We're her parents. And we have just as much right to be here \r\nas you do. And you don't have to like it, but you do have to deal with it. ",
        "Dr. Hartman: I apologize. I'll go check on Hope. ",
        "Jamal: Ok. Look, I'm sorry for going off like that. ",
        "Gabriela: It's ok. ",
        "Jamal: We'll be right outside. ",
        "Jamal: Right, brother? ",
        "Ricky: That was one pretty speech in there. But from where I'm standing, \r\nyou're the one treating my sister like the spare part. ",
        "",
        "Julie: I know it's short notice and you're really not prepared, but would you \r\nbe willing to take Christina today? ",
        "Lucy: Yes. ",
        "Lucy and Kevin: Of course. ",
        "Chris: Don't you think it'd be best if she just did this a little more \r\ngradually? ",
        "Julie: No. As a matter of fact, it won't get any easier. It hurts like hell, \r\nbut it is what I came here to do, and it's best for Christina. I just hope she \r\nunderstands. ",
        "Kevin: You'll find the words. ",
        "Julie: Chris, could you give me a few minutes alone with Lucy and Kevin? ",
        "Chris: Yeah. I'll be outside if you need me. ",
        "Julie: Ok. Lucy, there's a small suitcase behind the door. ",
        "Lucy: I'll get it. ",
        "Julie: Ok. ",
        "Kevin: Why don't you sit down?",

        "Julie: Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. ",
        "Lucy: Here you go. ",
        "Julie: Oh, thanks. You know, Christina is so young. And she probably won't \r\nremember much about me. ",
        "Lucy: We'll tell her how much you love her. And I promise you, Julie, I will \r\nnever, ever let her forget you. ",
        "Julie: I wanted her to really know me. So I put together some things that \r\nwere important to me to pass on to her. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. All your favorite things? ",
        "Julie: Yeah. Will you show them to her when you think she's ready? ",
        "Lucy: I -- I promise. ",
        "Julie: There are some letters and a video and a copy of my favorite book. I made some notes in the margins. ",
        "Lucy: And these are? ",
        "Julie: Love letters that Chris wrote me. I want her to know what falling in \r\nlove feels like, what it sounds like. ",
        "Lucy: I'm just -- I'm so sure that Christina will treasure all these thing as \r\nmuch as you do. ",
        "Julie: There's some special jewelry and my yearbook, my perfume, and my \r\nfavorite comfort sweater to comfort her, too. I even wrote down some of my best \r\njokes. I want her to laugh, Lucy. I don't want her to be sad. ",
        "Lucy: I know. I know. I'm amazed. This is so wonderful, that you've managed \r\nto somehow put your whole life in a suitcase for her. ",
        "Julie: Oh, no, not quite. I could never figure out how to get my love for \r\nChristina in here. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Julie -- ",
        "Julie: I thought I was ready, but -- oh, God -- tell me, Lucy -- how do you \r\nlet go of someone that you love more than life itself? How do you say goodbye?\r\n",

        "Karen: Is there any pain? ",
        "Alison: No, I just -- I have a slight headache and I got a small pain in my \r\nneck, but can you give me something for it? I mean, because I got a bus to \r\ncatch. ",
        "Karen: Yeah, well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you're grounded.\r\n",
        "Alison: What? For some bumps and bruises, Karen? ",
        "Karen: No, no. You could have a concussion or a neck injury. We won't know \r\nuntil we do some x-rays. ",
        "Alison: So I have to stay? ",
        "Karen: At least overnight for observations. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",

        "Livvie: Hey, Alison, we'll keep you company, if it means anything. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'll go call Jamal and tell him you took a spill. ",

        "Ricky: Not a chance, bro, because I know a user when I see one. ",
        "Jamal: I don't need to fight you, boy. We both care about Gabby. So why don't \r\nwe just leave it at that, all right? ",
        "Ricky: Who the hell do you think you are, huh? I was the one who was there \r\nfor Gigi when those kids knocked her down and broke her arm. I was the one that \r\nshe read to, ok? We looked after each other, which is what I'm trying to do now, \r\nand it's exactly what you're not doing right now! ",

        "Jamal: And this guy is too stubborn -- ",
        "Gabriela: Enough! Enough. Now, you two say you want what's best for me, so \r\nprove it. Put your differences aside until I'm out of here. Do you think you two \r\nmacho fools can do that? ",
