        "Chris: Can't tell you how much I appreciate this. ",
        "Clerk: Appreciate what? ",
        "Jack's voice: Hey, Livvie, it's Jack. I guess I kind of disappeared on you \r\nthe last few days. I decided to go talk to my probation officer in Westford and \r\nfigure out how to fix this mess. I know you wanted to go with me, but, yeah, I \r\nguess this was something I had to do on my own. But, hey, I'm back and I really, \r\nreally, really want to see you. So call me when you pick this up or just come to \r\nthe Recovery Room. I don't care how late it is, ok? Miss you. See you. ",

        "Livvie: Chris! ",
        "Chris: Hi. ",
        "Livvie: What are you doing in my room? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: Lucy? Lucy, if this doesn't feel right, just say so and we'll stop.\r\n",
        "Lucy: No, Doc, it's not me. It's you. This has to feel right for you. ",
        "",
        "Eve: Ian, make love to me. Oh. ",
        "Ian: No. ",
        "Eve: What? Why? ",
        "Ian: I've never wanted anyone more in my life. But we can't do this. ",

        "Jack: Recovery Room. No. No, you got the wrong number. Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Look, look, look, what's up with that? Huh? ",
        "Jack: Hey, I gave Livvie the number on her answering machine to call here. \r\nYou didn't happen to take a call from her, did you? ",
        "Jamal: Who, me? No, I haven't. ",
        "Jack: Damn. ",
        "Jamal: I thought you guys were supposed to be all tight and everything. ",
        "Jack: We are. Or, well, we were. She happened to find out that I got in \r\nsome trouble and it kind of shook things up a little bit. ",
        "Jamal: Ah, trouble. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: You mean, like, car trouble, huh? ",
        "Jack: You could say that. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, yeah? What else could you say? ",
        "Jack: Look, I stole one, all right? But it was no big deal. It was a long \r\ntime ago. ",
        "Jamal: That's why you haven't been around, then, huh? ",
        "Jack: Well, I had to back and check in with my probation officer and make \r\nsure everything was, you know, straightened out. ",
        "Jamal: So did you straighten everything out? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, better than ever. I mean, I have a chance to stay here in Port \r\nCharles if I get a steady job. ",
        "Jamal: So any chance your big brother could help you out with that? ",
        "[Jack laughs] ",
        "Jack: Yeah, maybe out the door. All Chris wants is basically to use my bad \r\nluck to turn Livvie against me. ",
        "",
        "Chris: Oh, Livvie. You surprised me. ",
        "Livvie: How'd you get in my room? ",
        "Chris: The maid let me in. She knew we were friends and I just told her I \r\nwanted to leave you a note. I was just about to write it when you showed up, \r\nhere you are. ",
        "Livvie: Great, now you can tell me to my face. What's the big emergency? ",
        "Chris: I just wondered if you'd spoken to Jack. ",
        "Livvie: Why? ",
        "Chris: Well, nobody's seen him since he, you know, told us how he'd broken \r\nprobation and I thought he might've skipped town. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, he wouldn't do that without telling me first. ",
        "Chris: Yeah. You know, Livvie, you really shouldn't expect too much from him.\r\n",
        "Livvie: Yeah, well, I believe in people. Besides, I think I know why you're \r\nso worried about Jack and me. ",
        "Chris: You do? ",
        "Livvie: Yeah. I mean, obviously I think it has something to do with the other \r\nnight when you walked in on us and we were -- you know -- together. ",
        "Chris: I'll admit that threw me. But you're an adult and I'm not going to \r\ntell you how to live your life. ",
        "Livvie: Well, that's a relief. ",
        "Chris: I will, however, question who you choose to live it with. ",
        "Livvie: Jack is your brother. ",
        "Chris: Yeah, and I'm afraid he's going to try to use you to get to me and \r\nyou're going to wind up getting your heart broken in the process. ",
        "Livvie: Oh, Chris! Sometimes you make it so hard for me to breathe. You need \r\nto understand that anything happening between Jack and me is with my eyes wide \r\nopen, including the other night. If I'm going to make any mistakes, they're mine \r\nto make. ",
        "Chris: But if you get hurt because of me -- ",
        "Livvie: I promise, I will not hold you responsible. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Clearly, I've lost my mind. This is what I wanted -- to have you with \r\nme, to hold you, to make love to you, and get lost in you. And now -- ",
        "Eve: Why do we have to stop? ",
        "Ian: Because I love you. And one moment in time couldn't nearly be enough.\r\n",
        "Eve: I -- I don't understand. ",
        "Ian: I don't just want you for one night. I want you for always. Do you \r\nremember when I took that poison? I was just laying there and I heard your voice \r\nand I saw your face -- through whatever my brain was drowning in -- and I \r\nthought, \"You know what, Ian? If you got to die now, it'd be all right because \r\nyou're in her arms.\" And I realized that when that day comes, be it today or \r\ntomorrow or, God willing, in 100 years from now, there's no place I'd rather be. \r\nDo you understand? ",
        "Eve: I think so. ",
        "Ian: I want us to have a life together. Someplace where it would fill our \r\nsouls, with tiny little rugrats that look like you running around. ",
        "[Eve sighs] ",
        "Ian: Could you stand it, Lambert? A whole lifetime of our kind of mayhem? ",
        "Eve: You take my breath away with your blarney. ",
        "Ian: No, no, no, no. Every word is true. I want us to grow old together and \r\nstill love each other. And we will, I know it. I saw it from the first moment I \r\nmet you. And I know it now. It's fate or destiny or whatever you want to call \r\nit. We need to live this out, Eve. ",
        "Eve: How can you be so sure? ",
        "Ian: After everything we've been through, how can you not be? ",
        "",
        "Kevin: I don't blame you for having second thoughts after what I put you \r\nthrough the other night. ",
        "Lucy: No, no, no. I don't want you to ever apologize to me about that. ",
        "Kevin: But I don't ever want to hurt you. ",
        "Lucy: And you won't, Doc. You couldn't. You wouldn't unless you woke up \r\ntomorrow morning and you regretted something we did -- or something we didn't do \r\ntonight. ",
        "[Kevin sighs] ",
        "Kevin: You know, I don't what it is, Lucy, but we just keep coming back into \r\neach other's lives time and again, no matter what we've been through or whoever \r\nwe've loved. Somehow our connection just never seems to be broken. Seems that \r\nyou are the constant in my life. But I can't go back. I've changed. I'm \r\ndifferent. We both are. But, Lucy, you make me feel that it's possible to have a \r\nfuture. But I never want to make you feel less than you are. ",
        "Lucy: You mean, because of Eve? ",
        "Kevin: I loved her, Lucy. And I'll never be able to forget her. ",
        "Lucy: I know that. And I don't want you to. She was your wife. And if you \r\nfelt any different, then you simply wouldn't be the man that I -- I care so very \r\nmuch about. ",
        "Kevin: It's not that simple. ",
        "Lucy: Doc, it is. It is that simple. I am the person that can help you get \r\nthrough all of this pain and I'm the person that can make you see what a \r\nwonderful future you can have. So, please -- believe me, it's not wrong for you \r\nto need me. ",
        "Kevin: You know, just standing here and looking in your eyes -- I can't \r\nexplain it, but there's something there. It's something familiar. And it's the \r\nreason we've been connected all this time. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, Doc. There has always, always been a very special place in my heart \r\nsaved \r\njust for you. ",
        "",
        "Ian: Can you tell me that after everything we've been through, you don't feel \r\nthe way I do? Have I misread you that completely? ",
        "Eve: No. No. I feel exactly the same way you do. I want to grow old together, \r\ntoo. But there's someone I need to talk to. ",
        "Ian: Kevin. ",
        "Eve: Where do I even begin? ",
        "Ian: Why don't we just take off and disappear and live our lives on a nice, \r\nwarm tropical island? Everyone thinks we're dead anyway. Who would know the \r\ndifference? ",
        "Eve: We would. I owe Kevin at least that much. ",
        "Ian: Of course you do. ",
        "Eve: You know, in spite of everything, he's -- he is my husband and I -- \r\nthere's a part of me that still loves him. ",
        "Ian: I know. ",
        "Eve: I mean, it's not like us. I realized that over the last few weeks. I \r\nhave never felt this way about anyone. It's like -- I come first with you. ",
        "Ian: First and last, you're everything to me, Eve. ",
        "Eve: But I got to be honest with you. It's pretty scary feeling so connected \r\nto someone else. ",
        "Ian: It's a good fit. ",
        "Eve: I've never known what it's like to sacrifice myself so completely for \r\nsomeone else and not feel like it's a sacrifice at all. You know? And I know \r\nthat you would do the same thing for me. ",
        "Ian: Whenever you need it. ",
        "Eve: That's why I can't walk away from this. I can't let you go. ",
        "Ian: I won't let you. ",

        "Eve: Oh, my God! What if it's Harris' men? ",
        "Ian: Shh. Hello? ",

        "[Eve sighs] ",
        "Ian: Actually, we're not. Come on in. ",
        "Sheriff: This cabin doesn't get used very much. ",
        "Eve: We were kidnapped. Ok? We'll tell you all about it on the way to Port \r\nCharles. ",
        "Ian: Do you know how to get there? ",
        "Sheriff: Of course I do. ",
        "Ian: Ok, well, we're just going to close up this place. We'll be right out.\r\n",
        "Sheriff: I'll wait outside. ",

        "Eve: This place doesn't quite seem so warm anymore, does it? ",
        "Ian: You ready? ",
        "Eve: As I'll ever be. I'll never forget this place. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. I'm going to miss it, too. ",
        "Eve: But we have the rest of our lives to tell each other how in love we are.\r\n",

        "Eve: I'm scared to death. ",
        "Ian: I told you I'll go with you. All you have to do is ask. ",
        "Eve: I know, but this is -- this is something I have to do alone. God, I \r\ndidn't realize how hard this was going to be. Once I tell Kevin that I'm in love \r\nwith you, the fact that I'm alive might not be such good news. ",
        "Ian: I'm not moving from this place till you get back, I promise you. ",

        "Lucy: Oh, I say way too many things. What did I say? ",
        "Kevin: \"Welcome home.\" I realize you weren't talking about this place or any \r\nplace. You were talking about right here. You and me. You're my home, Lucy. ",
