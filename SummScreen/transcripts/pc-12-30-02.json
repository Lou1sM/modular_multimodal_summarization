        "Lucy: Yeah, really. Oh, wait a minute, \r\none more thing -- there. You know, only blood relatives can do that. ",

        "Frank: You know, it seems like we've \r\nbeen to more weddings in this town, but as far as I'm concerned, there's only \r\none I really care about. ",
        "Karen: Oh, and what would that be?\r\n",
        "Frank: The one when everyone else is \r\ndown here, and you and me are up there. ",
        "Karen: Well, you know, weddings can be \r\nso beautiful, but there is something to be said about eloping and saving all \r\nthat energy for the honeymoon. ",

        "Jamal: Uh, yeah. Yeah, I kind of \r\nthought about that. Then I thought about how fate, luck, and God kind of somehow \r\nput us where we're supposed to be. ",

        "Rafe: No, no, no. What, are you \r\nkidding me? You're the doctor. You've got to tell me why my heart feels like \r\nit's about collide with my stomach and leave my body altogether. That is, if my \r\nknees don't fail me first.\r\n\n",
        "Ian: Well, you're about to tie the \r\nknot. It's a tough thing. Marriage is a tough thing. My old man used to call it \r\nthe ball and chain. But then, you should've seen him looking at my mother for \r\nall these years. Truth be told, there's a lot of love in this world, but it's \r\nrare when it all falls into place. Isn't that right, Mrs. Collins? ",
        "Lucy: Yes, it's a very rare thing, \r\nindeed. ",
        "Ian: Well, I'm -- I'm not really \r\nromantic anymore, you know, but I used to think that love is -- is like a \r\nbrand-new poem. In your own head, it's perfect. The hard part's making it come \r\nalive in somebody else. But if you find your soul mate, and you're lucky enough \r\nfor her to recognize you, then you're truly blessed. Don't waste a moment of \r\nthat, ok? ",

        "Alison: That's why it makes it that \r\nmuch more special to me. And my something blue is my garter. So I'm done. \r\n",
        "Amanda: I'm so pleased with the \r\nflorist. I knew that the roses that she picked was the right choice. Lilies are \r\nso commonplace. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, I said calla lilies, \r\nand they're divine. ",
        "Alison: You guys, are we honestly \r\nstill talking about flowers? ",
        "Elizabeth: No, no, no, no. No, no. I \r\nthink that, for this day, your grandmother and I can agree to get along.\r\n\n",
        "Alison: Good. That would mean so much \r\nto me. You have no idea because Rafe and I, we promised each other that we would \r\nonly focus on our wedding and each other for the entire day. ",
        "Elizabeth: That's exactly how it \r\nshould be. Sweetie, just being here with you makes this just as perfect as it \r\ncan be. ",

        "Stephen: You need water? ",
        "Elizabeth: No! No, Stephen, I can't do \r\nthis. I just -- oh, I can't even barely hold myself together in there. \r\n",
        "Stephen: Look, it's a very emotional \r\nday for you. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, you've got to stop \r\nthis, ok? I don't want to be a vampire.\r\n\n",
        "Stephen: Calm down, and tell me what \r\nhappened. ",
        "Elizabeth: I can't even control this. \r\nIt's completely permeated my senses. It's just -- my skin is burning. I can feel \r\nit rushing in my veins! ",
        "Stephen: It can be very intoxicating, \r\nif you allow it to be. ",
        "Elizabeth: I almost bit Alison, my own \r\ndaughter! I wanted to. ",
        "Stephen: Shh. Those are silly, silly \r\nthoughts. You couldn't bite her. You can't feed on a blood relative. You see? \r\nThere's nothing to be upset about. You're never going to hurt Alison, not ever.\r\n",
        "Elizabeth: No, you don't understand --\r\n",
        "Stephen: I -- I do understand. I was \r\nafraid once, too. Until I learned to live with it. Until I learned that most \r\npeople \r\nlive their entire lives never understanding their own senses -- how touch can \r\nfeel like electric current, how the scent of a flower is absorbed into every \r\npore, how the sound of a song can fill your soul. ",
        "Elizabeth: Then why is it so \r\nfrightening? ",
        "Stephen: Because it's bigger than \r\nanything you ever imagined. You're going to end up asking yourself, \"how can \r\nthis be real?\" And you're going to wonder how that pathetic little existence you \r\nhad before, you could even call it a life. This is ours for eternity, and we \r\nhaven't even scratched the surface yet, baby. Just think what could happen if we \r\nexplore this together. ",
        "Elizabeth: I don't know how. \r\n",
        "\nStephen: \r\nI'm gong to show you how. Hey, when the wedding's over, let's go away, just the \r\ntwo of us. You pick the place, I'll take care of everything, but most important, \r\ni'm going to take care of you. ",
        "Elizabeth: Ohh. Do you mean that?\r\n",
        "Stephen: Of course I do. Because I \r\nknow your heart. And it's the right heart for me. Come here. ",

        "Livvie: I don't know what you're \r\ntrying to prove, but I guarantee you Caleb wouldn't like it. ",
        "Joshua: You know, sometimes Caleb \r\ndoesn't know what's in his best interests. I'm afraid this is one of those \r\ntimes. ",
        "Livvie: That's absurd. Who died and \r\nleft you boss? ",
        "Joshua: Hopefully -- you. ",
        "Livvie: Why? What have I done? \r\n",
        "Joshua: What have you not done? You \r\nbetrayed him. You tried to kill him. You distract him from his important work. \r\nYou've done things you don't even know about. ",
        "Livvie: But I love him. ",
        "Joshua: \"Love\"? Don't make me laugh.\r\n",
